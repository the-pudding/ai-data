Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Tryna move on
I'm walking in rhythm
Singing my song
Thinking 'bout my baby
Tryna get home
Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Tryna move on
I'm walking in rhythm
Singing my song
Thinking 'bout my baby
Tryna get home

[Verse]
It's been so long since I've seen her
I'm tired and so all alone
I've traveled so very far
I've got to get back home
It's been so long since I've kissed her
And held her tight in my arms
I've got so far to go now
I've got to get back home
Got to get back home

[Refrain]
It's been so long since I've seen her
I'm tired and so all alone
I've traveled so very far
I've got to get back home
It's been so long since I've kissed her
And held her tight in my arms
I've got so far to go now
I've got to get back home
Got to get back home

[Chorus]
Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Tryna move on
I'm walking in rhythm (Walking in rhythm)
Singing my song (Singing my song)
Thinking 'bout my baby (Thinking 'bout my baby)
Tryna get home (Tryna get home)
I'm walking in rhythm (Walking in rhythm)
Singing my song (Singing my song)
Thinking 'bout my baby (Thinking 'bout my baby)
Tryna get home (Tryna get home)

I'm walking in rhythm (Walking in rhythm)
Singing my song (Singing my song)
Thinking 'bout my baby (Thinking 'bout my baby)
