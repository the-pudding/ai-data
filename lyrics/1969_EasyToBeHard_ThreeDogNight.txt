9 ContributorsEasy to Be Hard Lyrics[Verse 1]
How can people be so heartless?
How can people be so cruel?
Easy to be hard
Easy to be cold

[Verse 2]
How can people have no feelings?
How can they ignore their friends?
Easy to be proud
Easy to say no

[Bridge]
Especially people who care about strangers
Who care about evil and social injustice
Do you only care about the bleeding crowd?
How about a needing friend?
I need a friend

[Verse 3]
How can people be so heartless?
You know I'm hung up on you
Easy to be proud
Easy to say no

[Bridge]
Especially people who care about strangers
Who care about evil and social injustice
Do you only care about the bleeding crowd?
How about a needing friend?
We all need a friend

Easy to say no

Easy to say no
Much too easy to say noEmbed
