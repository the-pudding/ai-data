6 ContributorsHeart Attack LyricsMy mouth is dry
My legs are weak
I'm thinking this 'cause I can't speak
I'm looking at you
You're looking at me
You must think that I'm just crazy

If you only knew
What you're putting me through
Feels like
A heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack
Heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack

Must have died and gone to heaven
What a way to go

I can't catch my breath
It must be a dream
But you're the cutest thing I've ever seen
I'm way past the point
Of recovery
You're gonna be the death of me

If you only knew
What you're putting me through
Feels like
A heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack
Heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack
You might also likeMust have died and gone to heaven
What a way to go

Heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack
Heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attackEmbed
