14 ContributorsLove Is All Around Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes
Well, love is all around me and so the feeling grows
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go
So if you really love me, come on and let it show

[Chorus]
You know I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there be no end
'Cause on my love, you can depend

[Verse 2]
I see your face before me as I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking of all the things you said
You gave your promise to me and I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me in everything I do

[Chorus]
You know I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there be no end
Cause on my love, you can depend

[Verse 3]
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go
So if you really love me, come on and let it show
Come on and let it show
You might also like[Outro]
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it showEmbed
