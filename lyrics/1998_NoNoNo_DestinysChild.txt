Destiny's Child, hey

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin', won't you say what's on your mind?
’Cause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
But when I ask you, "What's the deal?", you hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
Boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love, it's all here for you, oh-yeah

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
If you keep actin' this way, you're gon' lose my love
I ain't got no time to play, you better hurry up
'Cause every time I come around and cruise 'round your way
I see you on the corner, but you don't know what to say
When I walk up to you, babe, you seem so shy
What's the problem, baby? Never had a girl like I?
I can see right through you and you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together ’cause you're runnin' out of time

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Wyclef Jean]
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Don't front, you know you really want it)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Is it alright if I play my guitar right here?)
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home, you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
Yo, close your eyes, shorty
You're guaranteed to be hypnotized
By the remix that Wyclef provide
I don't care about your size
Girl, shake your thighs
All I'm tryin' to do in the ’hood is stay alive
Make a little money with Destiny's Child
Thugs hear this song, they dance, they go wild
Like Texas, they movin' like
No Limit soldiers
They went from a dream to the young Supremes
Sing it, girls

[Chorus to fade: Destiny's Child & Wyclef Jean]
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it?)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it?)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it?)
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
