[Verse 1]
And if it's bad
Don't let it get you down, you can take it
And if it hurts
Don't let them see you cry, you can make it

[Chorus]
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head high
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head high

[Instrumental Break 01:22-01:36]

[Verse 2]
And if they stare
Just let them burn their eyes on you moving
And if they shout
Don't let it change a thing that you're doing

Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head up, woman
Hold your head high
