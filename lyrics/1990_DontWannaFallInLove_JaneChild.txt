16 ContributorsDon’t Wanna Fall In Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ain't no personal thing, boy
But you've got to stay away
Far, far away from my heart, my heart
Don't you know what your kiss is doing
Let me tell it to you from the start, boy

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I'll fight you to the end, baby

[Verse 2]
You've been hanging around, boy
And you have started sinking in
Whoa baby, you're way out of line now
Unaware how this all got started
Let me tell it you one more time, boy

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I'll fight you to the end, baby
You might also like[Chorus]
I don’t wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I’ll fight you to the end, baby

[Verse 3]
I learned something about myself
Last night with you I knew
I didn't want nobody else
And you're scaring me to death now, baby

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I’ll fight you to the end, baby

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I’ll fight you to the end, baby

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I’ll fight you to the end, baby
[Chorus]
I don’t wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I’ll fight you to the end, baby7Embed
