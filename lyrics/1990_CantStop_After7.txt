6 ContributorsCanâ€™t Stop Lyrics[Verse 1: Kevon Edmonds]
Last night, I had the time of my life
It's true
Oh, last night, I made love for the very first time
With you

[Pre-Chorus: Kevon Edmonds]
I never knew love could be so sweet, mmm
It never made a difference to me, mmm, well well
But ever since the day that you appeared
I'm telling you made the difference
Now love is so clear

[Chorus: After 7]
And I can't stop (I can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
We're diggin' on we
And no, I can't stop (I can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me

[Verse 2: Kevon Edmonds]
Last night, you brought something special out of me
Ooh-wee
And for the first time, girl
You made my dream a reality
Indeed
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Kevon Edmonds]
I never thought love was meant for me, mmm
I was blind and could not see, mmm, well well
You brought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the difference
Now love is so clear

[Chorus: After 7]
And I can't stop (I can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
We're diggin' on we
And I can't stop (I can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
Ooh-wee, girl

[Post-Chorus: Melvin Edmonds]
I can't stop
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
We're diggin' on we, girl
I can't stop
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
[Bridge: Kevon Edmonds]
You've got me thinking that I need protection
'Cause your love is so strong
I don't wanna do wrong
Girl, your love seems like it's true
I'm asking you just give me a call
And I'll give you my all

[Chorus: After 7]
Can't stop (I can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
We're diggin' on we, girl
Can't stop (I can't stop)
I can't stop how I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
You know I can't stop (I can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
We're diggin' on we, girl
You know I can't stop (I can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
[Outro: After 7]
Can't stop (I can't stop)
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
We're diggin' on we, girl
Can't stop (I can't stop)
I'm diggin' on you
You're diggin' on me
Can't stop (I can't stop)3Embed
