30 ContributorsWatching the Wheels Lyrics[Verse 1]
People say I'm crazy
Doin' what I'm doin'
Well, they give me all kinds of warnings
To save me from ruin
When I say that I'm okay
Well, they look at me kinda strange
"Surely you're not happy now?
You no longer play the game"

[Verse 2]
People say I'm lazy
Dreamin' my life away
Well, they give me all kinds of advice
Designed to enlighten me
When I tell 'em that I'm doin' fine
Watchin' shadows on the wall
"Don't you miss the big time, boy?
You're no longer on the ball"

[Chorus]
I'm just sittin' here watchin' the wheels go 'round and 'round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer ridin' on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

Ah, people askin' questions
Lost in confusion
Well, I tell them there's no problem
Only solutions
Well, they shake their heads and they look at me
As if I've lost my mind
I tell them, "There's no hurry
I'm just sittin' here doing time"

[Chorus]
I'm just sittin' here watchin' the wheels go 'round and 'round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer ridin' on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

[Outro]
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go8Embed
