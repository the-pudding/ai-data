It's time to show what you got
Players, take your places
There's only one way to the top
You must feel that victory
Release that energy and ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes, shake those butterflies
And do the best you can

You are the best
You seem to stand out from the rest
Ooh, your intentions
To be more than an honorable mention
You must feel that victory
Release that energy and ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes, shake those butterflies
Go ahead and go for the win now
