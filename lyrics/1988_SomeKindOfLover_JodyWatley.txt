8 ContributorsSome Kind of Lover Lyrics[Verse 1:]
I never knew what I was missing
Love with no passion in the kissing
I can't explain it, how you made me open up
And you showed me things I never thought I'd do, ho
I'd hate to think of ever losing you
'Cause there is no one that makes me feel the way you do

[Chorus:]
You're some kinda lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kinda lover
Make me feel, oh, so real

[Verse 2:]
Hold me and tell me that you love me
Only with you is where I wanna be
We'll light a candle as a symbol of our love
Then we'll move real close like in a perfect fantasy
I wish these moments could go on and on and on
But before you leave I want you to know
