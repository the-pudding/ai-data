66 ContributorsLive While Weâ€™re Young Lyrics[Verse 1: Liam]
Hey, girl, I'm waitin' on ya, I'm waitin' on ya
Come on and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up, the windows down

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
Yeah, we'll be doin' what we do
Just pretendin' that we're cool and we know it, too
Yeah, we'll keep doin' what we do
Just pretendin' that we're cool, so tonight

[Chorus: All, Harry]
Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy till we see the Sun
I know we only met, but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight, let's get some and live while we're young

[Post-Chorus: All, Zayn, Harry]
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
And live while we're young
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, let's get some and live while we're young

[Verse 2: Zayn & Niall, Zayn]
Hey girl, it's now or never, it's now or never
Don't overthink, just let it go
And if we get together, yeah, get together
Don't let the pictures leave your phone, oh-oh-oh
