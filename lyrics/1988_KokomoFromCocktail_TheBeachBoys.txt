1 ContributorKokomo - From Cocktail LyricsAruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go

Jamaica, off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all

Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go

Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go, way down in Kokomo

Martinique, that Monserrat mystique

We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by, we'll defy a little bit of gravity

That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high, way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go

Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go, way down in Kokomo

Port au Prince, I wanna catch a glimpse

Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go and get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go

Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go, way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we goEmbed
