16 ContributorsDream Lover Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms

[Chorus]
'Cause I want (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
I want a dream lover
So, I don't have to dream alone

[Verse 2]
Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old?

[Chorus]
'Cause I want (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
I want a dream lover
So, I don't have to dream alone

Someday, I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

[Verse 3]
Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
'Til all my lover's dreams come true

[Chorus]
'Cause I want (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
I want a dream lover
So, I don't have to dream alone

[Verse 3]
Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
'Til all my lover's dreams come true
[Chorus]
'Cause I want (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (Yeah-yeah)
I want a dream lover
So, I don't have to dream alone

[Outro]
Please don't make me dream alone
I beg you don't make me dream alone
No, I don't wanna dream alone4Embed
