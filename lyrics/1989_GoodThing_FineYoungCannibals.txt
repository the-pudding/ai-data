9 ContributorsGood Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
The one good thing in my life
Has gone away and I don't know why
She's gone away, I don't know where
Somewhere I cannot follow her

[Pre-Chorus]
The one good thing didn't stay too long (Hey, hey, hey, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
My back was turned and she was gone (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Good thing, where have you gone? (Do, do-do-do)
My good thing, you've been gone too long (Good thing, do, do, do-do-do)

[Verse 2]
People say I should forget
There's plenty more, don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
That's not what I want to hear (Hey, hey, hey, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I want to hear she wants me near (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Good thing, where have you gone? (Do, do-do-do)
My good thing, you've been gone too long (Good thing, do, do, do-do-do)

Good thing

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
Then one day, she came back
I was so happy that I didn't ask
Morning came into my room (Hey, hey, hey, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Caught me dreaming like a fool (Hey, hey, hey)

[Outro]
Good thing, ah-ah-ah, my good thing (Do, do-do-do)
My, my, my, my good thing, where have you gone? (Good thing, do, do, do-do-do)
My good thing, mhm, my good thing (Do, do-do-do)
Good thing, good thing, where have you gone? (Good thing, do, do, do-do-do)
It's been so long, good God, girl (Do, do-do-do, good thing)
Good God, girl, good God, girl (Do, do-do-do, good thing)
Good God (Do, do-do-do, good thing)
Good God, girl (Do, do-do-do)
Well, good God, girlEmbed
