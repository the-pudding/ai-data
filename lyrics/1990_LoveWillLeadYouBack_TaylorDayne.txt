Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darling, I'll set you free
But I know in time that we'll be together

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart, I know

[Chorus]
Love will lead you back
Someday, I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day, you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

[Verse 2]
One of these nights
Well, I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say how much you miss me
You walked out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
But darling, I know, I know this will be
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it takes
Some time out on your own now
To find your way back home

[Chorus]
Love will lead you back
Someday, I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
But I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart, I know, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Love will lead you back
Someday, I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back
Love will lead you back
Someday, I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back1Embed
