17 ContributorsSealed with a Kiss Lyrics[Verse 1]
Though we gotta say goodbye
For the summer
Darling, I promise you this
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

[Verse 2]
Yes! It's gonna be a cold
Lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

[Bridge]
I'll see you
In the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run
To tenderly hold you
But, darling, you won't be there!

[Verse 3]
I don't want to say goodbye
For the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh! Let us make a pledge
To meet in September
And seal it with a kiss
You might also like[Verse 4]
Yes! It's gonna be a cold
Lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

[Outro]
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss2Embed
