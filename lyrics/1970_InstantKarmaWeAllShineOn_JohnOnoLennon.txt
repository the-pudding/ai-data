Instant Karma's going to get you

Gonna knock you right on the head
You better get yourself together
Pretty soon you're gonna be dead

What in the world you thinking of
Laughing in the face of love?
What on earth you trying to do?
It's up to you, yeah you

Instant Karma's gonna get you
Going to look you right in the face
Better get yourself together, darling
Join the human race

How in the world you gonna see
Laughing at fools like me?
Who on earth do you think you are?
A superstar? Well, right you are

Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well, we all shine on
Every one, come on

Gonna knock you off your feet
Better recognize your brothers
Every one you'd meet

Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear
Why on earth are you there
When you're everywhere?
Come and get your share

Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
Come on and on and on, on, on

Yeah-yeah, alright
Ah-ha
Ah

Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
And we all shine on
On and on and on, on and on

Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well, we all shine on
Like the moons and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well, we all shine onEmbed
