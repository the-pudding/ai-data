Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did she say? (J-J-J-J-J.R.)

[Chorus: Imogen Heap & Jason Derulo]
Mm, whatcha say?
Oh, that you only meant well?
Well, of course, you did
Mm, whatcha say? (Jason Derulo)
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Of course, it is

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
I (I) was so wrong (Wrong) for so long (Long)
Only tryna please myself (Myself)
Girl, I (I) was caught up (Up) in her lust (Lust)
When I don't really want no one else, so no
I know I shoulda treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
So let me in (Let me in)
Give me another chance (Another chance)
To really be your man (Oh)
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be livin' so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl
