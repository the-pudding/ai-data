74 ContributorsBirthday Sex Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's yo' birthday so I know you want to ri-i-ide out
Even if we only go to my-y-y house
Sip mo' easy as we sit up on my-y-y couch
Feels good, but I know you want to cry-y-y out
You say you want passion, I think you found it
Get ready for action, don't be astounded
We switchin' positions, you feel surrounded
Tell me where you want your gift, girl

[Chorus]
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
I've been fiendin', wake up in the late-night dreamin' about your lovin' girl
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
Don't need candles or cake, just need yo' body to make, ooh
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It's the best day of the year, girl)
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It feels like, feels like, lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot, girl)

[Verse 2]
See you sexy and them jeans got me on tent
One, two, three, think I got you pinned (Uh-huh)
Don't tap out, fight until the end (Uh-huh)
Ring that bell; we gon' start over again
We grindin' with passion 'cause it's yo' birthday
Been at it for hours, I know you thirsty
You kiss me so sweetly, taste just like Hershey's
Just tell me how you want your gift, girl
You might also like[Chorus]
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
I've been fiendin', wake up in the late-night dreamin' about your lovin' girl
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
Don't need candles or cake, just need yo' body to make, ooh
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It's the best day of the year, girl)
Birthday sex, birthday sex (It feels like, feels like, lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot, girl)

[Verse 3]
First, I'm gonna take a dive into the water
Deep until I know I pleased that body, body, ah-ooh
Or, girl, without a broom, I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody, body how I do
Or maybe we can float on top my waterbed (Yeah)
You close your eyes as I improv between yo' legs (Yo' legs)
We work our way from kitchen stoves and tables
Girl, you know I'm more than able to please, yeah
Say you wanted flowers on the bed (On the bed)
But you got me and hours on the bed (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I
I've been fiendin', wake up in the late-night dreamin' 'bout your lovin' girl (Oh, I've been fiendin' for your lovin' girl)
Girl, you know I-I-I, girl, you know I-I-I (Oh-oh)
Don't need candles or cake, just need yo' body to make, ooh (We do not, we don't need, no)
Birthday sex, birthday sex (Oh, it's the best day of the year, girl)
Birthday sex, birthday sex (Oh, it feels like, feels like, lemme hit that G-spot, G-spot, girl)68Embed
