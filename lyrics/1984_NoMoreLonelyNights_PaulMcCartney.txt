16 ContributorsNo More Lonely Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can wait another day until I call you (Mm-hm)
You've only got my heart on a string and everything aflutter
But another lonely night (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Might take forever (Na-na-na-na-na)
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me, love

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know what I feel
To be right

[Chorus]
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there

[Verse 2]
May I never miss the thrill (Na-na-na na, na-na-na na)
Of being near you (Na-na-na-na-na)
And if it takes a couple of years to turn your tears to laughter

[Pre-Chorus]
I will do what I feel
To be right
You might also like[Chorus]
No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there

[Bridge]
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, I know (I know) what I feel (I feel)
To be right (Be right)

[Chorus]
No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there

[Bridge]
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
[Outro]
No more lonely nights
No, no (Hoo)
