4 ContributorsSweeter Than You LyricsI could never be loved by anyone sweeter than you
And I could never belong to anyone sweeter than you
With you to stand beside me I'll never be alone
And what more could I long for than to have you for my own

My only desire is loving you eternally
For no, no other love could ever mean so much to me
So if you say you love me forever I'll be true
And what more could I long for than to live my life with you

I could never be loved by anyone sweeter than you
And I could never belong to anyone sweeter than youYou might also like3Embed
