5 ContributorsDoing It All for My Baby Lyrics[Verse 1]
Early in the morning, I'm still in bed
She comes to me with sweet affection
Wakes me with kisses, "Hello sleepyhead."
Gets me moving in the right direction
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

[Chorus 1]
Doing it all for my baby
'Cause she's as fine as she can be
I'm doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

[Verse 2]
Later in the evening, it's been a busy day
She lays her head upon my weary shoulder
Listen to her laughing, snuggle up and say:
"Now I'm with you baby, the loneliness is over"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

[Chorus 2]
Doing it all for my baby
'Cause she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

[Chorus 3]
Doing it all for my baby
'Cause she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

[Ad libs]
Doing it, doing it
Doing it, doing it
Doing it, yeah

Doing it, doing it
Ooh-hoo-hoo

Doing it (doing it)
Doing it (doing it)
Doing it, doing it
Doing it, yeah

Doing it (doing it)
Doing it (doing it)
Ooh-hoo-hoo

(Doing it all for my baby)
Doing it all for my baby
(Doing it all for my baby)
She's as fine as she can be
(Doing it all for my baby)
Doing it all for my baby
(Doing it all for my baby)
She's so fine
