12 ContributorsMoonlight Feels Right Lyrics[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
The wind blew some luck in my direction
I caught it in my hands today
I finally made a tricky French connection
You winked and gave me your o.k

I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way

[Chorus]
Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right

[Verse 2]
We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smilin' bright
I'll play the radio on southern stations
Cause southern belles are hell at night

You say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss
Class of seven four gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again
You might also like[Chorus]
Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right

[Bridge]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
We'll see the sun come up on Sunday morning
And watch it fade the moon away
I guess you know I'm giving you a warning
Cause me and noon are itching to play

I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothin' like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way

[Chorus]
Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right
