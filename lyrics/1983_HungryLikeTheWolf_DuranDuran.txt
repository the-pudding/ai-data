Ha-ha!

[Verse 1]
Darken the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, Earth is afire
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do
Woman, you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do

[Chorus]
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

[Verse 2]
Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do
High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do, do-do

Scent and a sound, I'm lost, and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
Mouth is alive, all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf

[Interlude]
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf

[Chorus]
Burning the ground, I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
I smell like I sound, I'm lost, and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

[Chorus]
Burning the ground, I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Scent and a sound, I'm lost, and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
Mouth is alive, all running inside
And I’m…15Embed
