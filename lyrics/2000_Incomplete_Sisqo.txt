11 ContributorsIncomplete Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh yeah yeah, uh
Listen

[Verse 1]
Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still, I'm lonely now
Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers, wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
Said, without you girl, ahh
Listen

Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year, winter, summer, spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
Oh yeah, that without you, girl, ahh

[Bridge]
I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything, ha
And everything
To hear you say
That you'll stay
[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
(All of the women, all of the money)
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything (Just give me my baby)
But I can't pretend that I don't see (Yeah, yeah)
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
(Without you, alright, alright, alright)
Even though it seems I have everything  (Even though it seems)
I don't wanna be a lonely fool (That I got everything)
All of the women, all the expensive cars
(I don't have you, I don't have you, you make me wanna cry, baby)
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything (Oh)
But I can't pretend that I don't see (Baby, hey, yeah)
That without you girl my life is incomplete

[Outro]
Without you, girl
Without you, girl, my life
Without you, girl, my life, my life is incomplete
Without you, girl, my life is incomplete
Oh yeah, my life is incomplete
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah5Embed
