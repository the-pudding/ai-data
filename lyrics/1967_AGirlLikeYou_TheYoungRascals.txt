2 ContributorsA Girl Like You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know what it's all about
But I feel I'll soon find out
I'm sure, never felt this secure
It's nothin' like I ever thought it would be
Someone opened up a door for me

[Chorus]
A girl like you (I'm in love with)
Girl like you (I'm in love with)
Must be you that caused this feelin' in me
(Must be you) You that fills me confidently
(Must be you) You that brings the best out in me
You, nobody but you

[Verse 2]
I don't know what it's all about
I can't begin to figure out
What to do, so I'll leave it to you
Only know that when you're away from me
Nothin' satisfies the need in me

[Chorus]
For a girl like you (I'm in love with)
A girl like you (I'm in love with)
Must be you that caused this feelin' in me
(Must be you) You that fills me confidently
(Must be you) You that brings the best out in me
You, nobody, nobody, oh yeah!

Every time I'm holdin' you close to me
Trouble's gone, it's gone, I'm in ecstasy

[Outro]
With a girl (I'm in love with)
A girl like you (I'm in love with)
Someone to love me, yeah (I'm in love with)
Girl like you (I'm in love with)
Someone, someone to understand (I'm in love with)
Exactly like you, honey (I'm in love with)
Girl, girl, girl (I'm in love with)
Girl, girl, girl (I'm in love with)...Embed
