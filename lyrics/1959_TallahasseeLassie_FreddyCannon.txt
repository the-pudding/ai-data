Well, she comes from Tallahassee
She got a hi-fi chassis
Maybe looks a little sassy
But to me, she's real classy
Yeah, my Tallahassee Lassie
Down in F-L-A

[Bridge]
Well, she's romping to the drag, the cha-cha, rag-a-mop
Stomping to the shag, rocks the bunny hop
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Well, she dances to the bop, she dances to the stroll
She dances to the walk, she can rock and roll

[Chorus]
She's my Tallahassee lassie
Yeah, my Tallahassee lassie
She's my Tallahassee lassie
Down in F-L-A

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Well, she's romping to the drag, the cha-cha, rag-a-mop
Stomping to the shag, rocks the bunny hop
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Well, she dances to the bop, she dances to the stroll
She dances to the walk, she can rock and roll

She's my Tallahassee lassie
Yeah, my Tallahassee lassie
She's my Tallahassee lassie
Down in F-L-A

[Outro]
Come on, baby
Come on, honey
Yeah, come on, sugar
Come on, babyEmbed
