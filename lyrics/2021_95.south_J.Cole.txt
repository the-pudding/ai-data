Black Goku, slap these rap hopefuls
Snatch ya stacked vocal tracks off the Pro Tools
Lemme show you how a pro move
I could take a stroll in the middle of Chernobyl
I could put the whole damn game in a chokehold
Stunner to the dome, on the floor like I'm Stone Cold
Butter with the flows when I float on the ropes though
You don't really wanna be the target in my focal
Put a shell to ya back like a slowbro
Neo when I move, see the whole world in slo-mo
Killa with the tools, it ain't sweet when I reign bows
Bodies in thе morgue looking more like Janе Does
Know they fresh like them halos a day old
Drapeto never been a slave to a name on a payroll
Still they wanna play with the god, you ain't Kraytos
You the goat? Nah, scapegoat
Cut the head, feed it to a volcano
Swerving down the 95 South like J. Cole
I was in the cut so much, had to lay low
Couldn't get a cut, now I look like a young Hov
The rap basquiat, feel like I'm Pac with locs
Two shots in the dark when I pop a cop
Need despot on top like I'm Papa Doc
And I rock when I drop, they just talk a lot
So stop, watch how I move
Do it broad day like we strike at high noon
Family ties like crips and pyroos
Gotta be nice when I script a haiku
All my niggas sinners, never lift a bible, we tribal
It's still fuck you and the god that you pray to
One punch leave 'em slumped like they smoking on K2
Whole village full'a killers and you know they got K2s
The Father, the Holy Spirit, send you up to meet JesúsYou might also likeEmbed
