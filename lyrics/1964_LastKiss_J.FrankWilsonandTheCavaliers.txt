7 ContributorsLast Kiss Lyrics[Chorus]
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 1]
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
The car was stalled the engine was dead

I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The crying tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

[Chorus]
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 2]
Well, when I woke up, the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running in my eyes
But I found my baby somehow that night
You might also likeI raised her head and she smiled and said
"Hold me darling for a little while"
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life that night

[Chorus]
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmmEmbed
