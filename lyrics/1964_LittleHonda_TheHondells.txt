1 ContributorLittle Honda Lyrics[Intro]
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna wake you up early
Cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're going down to the Honda shop
I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Put on a ragged sweatshirt
I'll take you anywhere you want me to

[Chorus]
First gear, it's alright (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I lean right (Little Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's alright

[Verse 2]
It's not a big motorcycle
Just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys
That two-wheel bike
We'll ride on out of the town
To any place I know you'll like
You might also like[Chorus]
First gear, it's alright (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I lean right (Little Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's alright

[Verse 3]
It climbs the hills like a Matchless
Cause my Honda's built really light
When I go into the turns
And I hang on tight
I'd better turn on the lights
So we can ride my Honda tonight

[Chorus]
First gear, it's alright (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I lean right (Little Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's alright

[Outro]
First gear, it's alright (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I lean right (Little Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's alright
First gear, it's alright (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I lean right (Little Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's alrightEmbed
