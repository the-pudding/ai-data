[Verse 3: Pretty Russ]
You got me twisted thinking about the way that things use to be
When it was you and me girl I was so free, see
You had my heart from the start like Cupid
And I was just downright foolish and stupid
But now I know the reason for the pain and the headaches
You left me all alone now I can’t even concentrate
I guess I’ll wait for the day until you come back
Because my heart is where your love is at
You got me twisted

[Chorus: Keith Sweat & (Kut Klose)]
(You know you want my lovin') You know you want my lovin' baby
(You got me twisted over you) Girl you got me twisted baby
(I know I got what you need) I got everything you need tonight
(So what you wanna do) What are you gonna do baby
(You know you want my lovin') You know, I can make you feel real good if you let me baby
(You got me twisted over you) Girl you got me twisted baby
(I know I got what you need) I got everything you need tonight
(So what you wanna do) What are you gonna do baby
(You know you want my lovin') You know you want my lovin' baby11Embed
