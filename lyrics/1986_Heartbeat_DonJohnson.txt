You can give it away
Your money don't mean much to me
I've been out on my own
Going to go it alone now
Cause that´s the way it´s got to be

Everybody tells me how
I can beat the odds for now
I've been standing by the fire
I just can't feel the heat
Can't feel the heat

Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine

Looking at me, it's easy to see
You think you know just how I feel
Well you do me wrong
And it won't take me long
Before my restless heart will heal

I'm looking for love, a love like mine
They tell me it's so hard to find
Well I can feel it in the rhythms
The heartbeat in the streets
You might also likeHeartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine
Beating like mine

Tell me what you feel now
We've got a heartbeat
Baby is it real now
We've got a heartbeat
Heartbeat

Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat...2Embed
