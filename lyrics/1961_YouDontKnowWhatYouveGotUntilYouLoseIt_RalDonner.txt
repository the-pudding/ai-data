2 ContributorsYou Don’t Know What You’ve Got (Until You Lose It) LyricsYou don't know what you've got until you lose it
You gave me you-your love but I abused it
And now I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
'Cause I know now I acted in a foolish way
(Oh yeah) uh-huh-huh (oh yeah) oh-oh-yeah

You don't know what you've got until you lose it
You gave me you-your love but I misused it
I never knew how lonely loneliness could be
And now I need you, dear, as you once needed me
(Oh yeah) uh-huh-huh (oh yeah) oh-oh-yeah

So now if you'd come to this lonely heart you own
I'd give you all my lovin' like you've never known
(Bung, bung, bung, bung)
You don't know what you've got until you lose it
You gave me you-your love but I misused it

And now I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
'Cause I know now I acted in a foolish way
(Oh yeah) uh-huh-huh (oh yeah) oh-oh-yeah
(Oh yeah) uh-huh-huh (oh yeah) oh-oh-yeah

(Oh yeah) uh-huh-huh (oh yeah)You might also likeEmbed
