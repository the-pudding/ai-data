Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow

[Verse 1]
One night in the disco on the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so boring, filled with out-of-towners touring
I knew that it wasn't my thing
I really wasn't caring, but I felt my eyes staring
At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

[Chorus]
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen (Ooh)
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow

The champion of dance, his moves will put you in a trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance, but not conceit, as a man, he's complete
My crème de la crème, please take me home
He wears the finest clothes, the best designers, heaven knows
Ooh, from his head down to his toes
Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci
He looks like a still, that man is dressed to kill

[Chorus]
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen (I've ever seen)
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow (Ooh-ooh-ooh, wow)
Oh, what, wow (Hey)
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen (I love your moves)
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen (I've ever seen)
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow (Ooh-ooh-ooh, wow)
Oh, what, wow (Hey)
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen (I love your moves)
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen2Embed
