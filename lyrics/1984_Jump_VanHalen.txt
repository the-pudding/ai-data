Ow!

[Verse 1]
I get up, and nothing gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby, just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches to get to what's real

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, can't you see me standing here?
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh, can't you see what I mean?

[Chorus]
Ah, might as well jump (Jump!)
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump

[Verse 2]
Hello! Hey, you! Who said that?
Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know
You won't know until you begin
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So can't you see me standing here?
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh, can't you see what I mean?

[Chorus]
Ah, might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump

[Post-Chorus]
Jump!
[Guitar Solo]

[Keyboard Solo]

[Chorus]
Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Get it and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
[Outro]
