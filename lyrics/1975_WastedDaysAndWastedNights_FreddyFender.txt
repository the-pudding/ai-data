10 ContributorsWasted Days and Wasted Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind
For you don't belong to me
Your heart belongs to someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
Why should I keep loving you?
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue

[Chorus]
Don't you remember the day
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely, prayed for you only
My love

[Pre-Chorus]
Why should I keep loving you?
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue

[Bridge]
Oooh, oooh. ooh
(Music)
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't you remember the day
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely, cried for you only
My love

[Outro]
Why should I keep loving you?
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue1Embed
