46 ContributorsTouch My Body Lyrics[Intro: Mariah Carey & The-Dream]
MC
Uh, uh, uh, in the place to be
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I know that you been waiting for it, I'm waiting too
In my imagination, I be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me, hundred and two
And, boy, I know I feel the same, my temperature's through the roof

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gon' leave with me when I do, I do
If there's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, 'tween you and I

[Chorus]
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body
You might also like[Verse 2]
Boy, you can put me on you like a brand-new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in the Caribbean Sea

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gon' leave with me when I do, I do
If there's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, 'tween you and I

[Chorus]
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body
[Bridge]
I'ma treat you like a teddy bear
You won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury
Laying intertwined with me (La-la-la-la-da-da-da)
You won't want for nothing, boy (No)
I will give you plenty joy (Touch my body)

[Chorus]
Touch my body, put me on the floor (Throw me on the floor)
Wrestle me around, play with me some more (Ooh, touch my body)
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs (Let me wrap my thighs)
All around your waist, just a little taste (Around your waist for just a little taste)
Touch my body, know you like my curves (I know you like it)
Come on and give me what I deserve (Give me what I deserve, babe)
And touch my body

[Outro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Every little way you like to touch my body, baby
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Just touch my body
Eh, yeah, ooh-ooh, baby
Oh, ooh-ooh, touch my
Touch my body
Oh, ooh, woah, woah
Come on and give me what I deserve
Touch my body
Oh, ooh-ooh
