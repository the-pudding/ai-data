6 ContributorsFever Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

[Chorus]
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

[Chorus]
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 3]
Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long time ago

You give me fever
Baby, turn on your lovelight (Yeah, yeah)
Let it shine on me (Yeah, yeah)
Well, baby, turn on your lovelight (Yeah, yeah)
And let it shine on me (Yeah, yeah)
Well, just a little bit higher (Yeah, yeah)
And just a little bit brighter, baby (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
You give me fever, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You give me fever,  yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You give me fever, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You give me feverEmbed
