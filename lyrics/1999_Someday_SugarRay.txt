14 ContributorsSomeday Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someday, when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why, you were always there for me
One way, in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and they'll fade away

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

[Verse 2]
Some say, better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say, you were always there for me
Some way, when the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time and they fade away
And fade they away

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

[Bridge]
Someone said we tried too long (Someday will pass me by)
Someone said we got it all wrong (Someday, I wonder why)
Someone said we tried too long (Someday will pass me by)
Is there a place where I belong? (Someday will)

So far
So long
So far away
So far
So wrong
So far away away away

[Verse 1 repeated]
Someday, when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why, you were always there for me
One way, in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and they'll fade away

[Outro]
And they fade away (repeats many times until it fades out)5Embed
