Still in love, mmm
I'm still in love
(With you)
With you
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da, la-da-da-da, la-da-da-da, la-da-da-da
Still in love
Listen

[Verse 1: Ralph Tresvant]
Oh, what can I do, girl?
So much in love, girl
But your friends got you thinkin'
And it's affecting you
(Don't listen, baby)
What can I do, girl?
So in love, girl
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't wanna lose you

[Pre-Chorus: Ricky Bell]
No
What would I do without your love?
Baby, it's heaven sent from above
So you don't believe
What your friends tell you about me

I'm still the man for you
And I'm still the man that's true
And I'm still the man who's lucky

They're just jealous of me and you
And I'll always keep you happy
'Cause I'm still in love with you (Oh yeah)
I'm still in love (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Ricky Bell]
Time passes so fast, babe
I wish it would last, babe
'Cause I know in my heart
That my life ends and starts with you, yeah
And, baby, I know that this feelin'
I'm feelin' just won't let me go, baby
(You know why?)
'Cause you're the first true love I've ever known

(Ooh-ho)
And I'm still in love with you
(I said, I'm still in love with you)
It don't matter what your friends do
(Don't matter what they say to you)
They're just jealous of me and you
(It don't matter)
And I'll always keep you happy
(It just don't matter)
(The only thing that matters is that I'm still in love with you)
'Cause I'm still in love with you
(Woo)

[Bridge: Ricky Bell]
Oh, what can I do to right this wrong?
I know that it makes me happy
To be in love with you
So...

[Chorus: New Edition, Ralph Tresvant, Ricky Bell]
I'm still the man for you
(Hey, baby)
And I'm still the man that's true

And I'm still the man who's lucky
(Still the man) (Whoa, oh yeah, yeah)
And I'm still in love with you
(Oh, ah yeah)
It don't matter what your friends do
(You see it don't matter)
They're just jealous of me and you
(It don't matter) (Said, it don't matter)
And I'll always keep you happy
(It don't matter) ('Cause I'll always)
(Always)
'Cause I'm still in love with you (Oh)
