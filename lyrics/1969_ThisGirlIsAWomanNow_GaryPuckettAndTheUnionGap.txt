This girl walked in dreams
Playing in a world of her own
This girl was a child
Existing in a playground of stone
Then one night her world was changed
Her life and dreams were rearranged
And she would never be the same again

[Chorus]
This girl is a woman now, and she's learning how to give
This girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about
And she's learning, learning to live

[Verse 2]
This girl tasted love, as tender as the gentle dawn
She cried a single tear, a teardrop that was sweet and warm
Our hearts told us we were right
And on that sweet and velvet night
A child had died, a woman had been born

[Chorus]
This girl is a woman now, and she's learning how to give
This girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about
And she's learning, learning to live
This girl is a woman now, she's learning how to give
This girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about
And she's learning, learning, learning to live
This girl is a woman now, she's learning how to giveYou might also likeEmbed
