10 ContributorsSay It Isnâ€™t So Lyrics[Intro: John Oates]
Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it
Say it isn't so

[Verse 1: Daryl Hall]
Say it isn't so painful
To tell me that you're dissatisfied
The last time I asked you, I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen
You see em' goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way
That bites it even more

[Verse 2: Daryl Hall and John Oates]
Say it
Tell me what you want
Yeah, I'll do it, Baby, I promise right now
Say it
Who propped you up when you were stopped
Low motivation had you on the ground?

[Pre Chorus: Daryl Hall]
I know your first reaction
You slide away, hide away, goodbye
But if there's a doubt, maybe I can give out
A thousand reasons why you have to say it isn't so
You might also like[Chorus: Daryl Hall and John Oates]
It isn't so
Now say It isn't so
It isn't so
Now say it isn't so
It isn't so
Oh, say it isn't so
It isn't so

[Verse 3: Daryl Hall and John Oates]
Say it
We like to be the strangers at the party
Two rebels in a shell
Say it
You like to move with the best of them
You know we, move so well

[Pre Chorus 2: Daryl Hall]
Don't need someone to lean on
I know why there's an open door
But if I'm faced with being replaced
I want you even more
So baby, say it isn't so

[Chorus: Daryl Hall and John Oates]
It isn't so
Now say It isn't so
It isn't so
Now say it isn't so
It isn't so
Oh, say it isn't so
It isn't so
[Refrain: John Oates]
Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it
Say it isn't so

[Bridge: Daryl Hall]
Why you wanna go
Do you have to say
You wanna go?
Ooh, oh baby say it isn't

[Outro Coda: Daryl Hall and John Oates]
Say it isn't
Say, say, say it isn't
Say it isn't
So
So, say it isn't
Why you have to say it isn't
Say it isn't
So
Say it isn't
So
So, say it isn't
I know its so hard for you
Say it isn't
So hard
Say it isn't
Don't say it, babe
So, say it isn't
There must be some other way
Don't have to
Say it isn't
Some other way
So, say it isn't
Ha, you don't have to say
Say it isn't
Oh, you don't have to say
So, say it isn't
Ooh, you know I wanna make you
Say it isn't
Say it isn't
