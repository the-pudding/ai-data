Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh yeah

[Verse 1: Amel Larrieux]
I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise, ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you

[Chorus: Amel Larrieux]
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to
Yeah

[Verse 2: Amel Larrieux]
If you thought I'd sleep on this
Boy, you're wrong 'cause all I dream about is our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't miss, no, no
Boy, you wanna know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm saying are for real
'Cause you got more appeal than any man in this whole world
And baby, I got to know how you feel, yeah
You might also like[Chorus: Amel Larrieux]
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to, ooh ooh

[Bridge: Amel Larrieux, Trey Lorenz, Both]
Sweetheart, now it's time I let you know
I don't wanna rush, we should take it slow
Boy, I can love you, can you help me grow
Give me a new beginning (And I'll give you a happy ending)
Tell me if you want me to
(Oh, my love, please tell me if you want me to)
I want you to, I want you to
(I wanna make it good) Yes, I do
(I wanna make it good to you, baby)
Oh oh yeah, yeah
(So won't you tell me) Tell me
(Tell me, whoa-ho-ho-oh, yeah)
(Tell me if you want me to)
(Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh, baby)
(I wanna make it good for you)
(Huh, huh, huh, uh-huh)
(I promise, girl, that I'll be true)
(Oh, ho, oh, oh)
(So tell me if you want me to)
(Tell me, baby)
Hey, hey
[Outro: Amel Larrieux]
Tell me if you want me to
Wanna make it good for you
Promise, girl, that I'll be true
Tell me if you want me to
Tell me if you want to
I can make it good for you
I promise that I'll be true
I really, really want to
I promise, girl, that I'll be true
So tell me if you want me to
I promise that I'll be true
I really, really want to
Tell me if you want me to
I wanna make it good for you14Embed
