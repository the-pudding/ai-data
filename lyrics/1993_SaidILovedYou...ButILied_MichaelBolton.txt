19 ContributorsSaid I Loved You...But I Lied Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
You are the candle, love's the flame
A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
'Til the end of time

[Pre-Chorus]
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

[Chorus]
Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

[Verse 2]
With all my soul, I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain?
This taste of heaven, so deep, so true
I've found in you

My life has just begun
Need you forever, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

[Chorus]
Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

[Pre-Chorus]
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

[Chorus]
Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you
[Outro]
But this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you...but I lied1Embed
