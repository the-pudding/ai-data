Hey, hey, hey

Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy

[Verse 1: Fabo]
Oh, I'm lookin' for Mrs. Bubble Gum, I'm Mr. Chick-O-Stick
I wanna dun-dun-dun, oh, 'cause you so thick
Girls call me Jolly Rancher, oh, 'cause I stay so hard
You can suck me for a long time, oh my God
Girl, this ain't no dance flo', this a candy sto'
And I'm really geeked up, and I got mo' dro'
I pop, I roll, it's all I know
It's the summertime but yo laffy taffy got me froze (oh)
Get loose (oh), get low (oh)
Don't be shy, hoe, I'm Fabo (oh)
I know you wanna ride, you a star and it shows
What's happenin'? Whassup, whassup let's go, let's go, let's go

[Chorus: Fabo]
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)

Uh, c'mon trick, c'mon trick
Here go Mr. Chocolate
I like the way you break it down
Waddle, stop you watchin' me
Laffy taffy I'm likin' this
Big ole ass you shakin' bitch
Close yo mouth and don't say shit
Bend on ova and hit a split
Work that pole and work it well
Stacks on deck, yo ankles swell
Girl, lemme touch ya

Security guard don't scare nobody
Damn right I touched that ho
All this money just hit the flo'

[Verse 3: Mook-B]
Hey, say baby girl
Oh, what you gon' do?
I got a hundred ones
I wanna po' on you
Just keep that ass shakin'
And I keep tippin' you
While I sit back like a playa
Sippin' grey goose
Feelin' all loose
'Cause girl you on yo job
You got my dick hard
The way you touch them toes
Workin' them micros
On the stilettos
You made it skeet-skeet-skeet
Like a water hose
[Verse 4: Shawty Lo]
(Candy girl) Got me goin' in my pocket pullin' out mo' dough
Let the waitress know I need to order, five hundred mo'
You best believe later on we headed to the mo'
So go on and pack them bags, and let's motherfuckin' go
I'm waitin' on yo fine ass at the front do'
Girl, you don't know
I'ma get that laffy taffy, toss it, flip it, and slap it
Bust a couple of nuts and get right back at it

[Chorus: Fabo]
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
Shake that laffy taffy, shake that laffy taffy
Girl, shake that laffy taffy, that laffy taffy
That laffy taffy, that laffy taffy (Candy girl)9Embed
