15 ContributorsDance To The Music Lyrics[Intro: Cynthia Robinson]
Say, get up and dance to the music!
Get on up and dance to the music!

[A Cappella Break: Sly Stone, Freddie Stone, Larry Graham]

[Chorus: All, Greg Errico, Freddie Stone]
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music (Hey, Greg) What?

[Verse 1: Freddie Stone]
All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat, yeah
I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet

[Verse 2: Larry Graham, Sly Stone]
I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide
You might like to hear my organ
I said ride, Sally, ride, now

[Bridge: Freddie Stone, Cynthia Robinson, Jerry Martini]
Cynthia (What?) Jerry (What?)
If I could hear the horns blow
Cynthia on the throne, yeah
Listen to me, Cynthia and Jerry
Got a message they're sayin'
All the squares, go home (Yeah)
Yeah, ooh
Listen to the voices

Dance to the music (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dance to the music (Oh, now, now)
Said, dance to the music (Yeah)
Dance to the music (Yeah)
Dance to the music
