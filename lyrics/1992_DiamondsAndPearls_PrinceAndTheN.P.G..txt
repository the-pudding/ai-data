2 ContributorsCircus LyricsI don't know why you think you're worth it
You put on a show like its a god damn circus

Remember when i used to think you're perfect
Never again now that's for certain

I don't know why you think you're worth it
You put on a show like its a god damn circus

Remember when I used to think you're perfect
Never again I said never again

I don't know why
You think you're that fly

But girl you got me fucked up
I'm not that guy

Blunts in rotation
Why you hating

Tell me what's your motivation
You had your shot

But you got caught
In another lie now guess what?
You might also likeI only love the loyal and truthful
But baby girl you know that ain't you though

More drinks poured
I know that you're bored

But your ass still getting ignorеd
Don't even pretеnd

No time left to spend
Can't deal with that again

I'm with them unknown friends
I don't know why you think you're worth it

You put on a show like its a god damn circus
Remember when i used to think you're perfect

Never again now that's for certain
I don't know why you think you're worth it

You put on a show like its a god damn circus
Remember when I used to think you're perfect

Never again I said never again
Prince, Diamonds and pearls
You was my world
But then it turned out that you was everyone's

Girl
No we ain't amigos

Don't call me, ho
I hear no, see no, say no evil

You're out of your mind
Hitting my line

You ain't shit
So why would i give you my time

Two bad bitches hugged up at my house
I got loud and its motherfucking nice out

Thought you was the one
But you was too dumb

I'm doing much better and I'm rolling up some
Big doinks in the studio

Could have been with you ya know?
Didn't work you're a stupid ho
I thought you should know
I don't know why you think you're worth it

You put on a show like its a god damn circus
Remember when i used to think you're perfect

Never again now that's for certain
I don't know why you think you're worth it

You put on a show like its a god damn circus
Remember when I used to think you're perfect

Never again I said never againEmbed
