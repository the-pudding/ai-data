7 ContributorsDown in the Boondocks Lyrics[Chorus]
Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks
People put me down 'cause that's the side of town I was born in
I love her, she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks

[Verse 1]
Every night I watch the lights from the house upon the hill
I love a little girl that lives up there, and I guess I always will
But I don't dare knock on her door 'cause her daddy is my boss man
So I'll just have to be content to see her whenever I can

[Chorus]
Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks
People put me down 'cause that's the side of town I was born in
I love her, she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks

[Bridge]
Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks

[Verse 2]
One fine day I'll find a way to move from this old shack
I'll hold my head up like a king and I never, never will look back
Until that mornin' I'll work and slave, and I'll save every dime
But tonight she'll have to steal away to see me one more time
You might also like[Chorus]
Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks
People put me down 'cause that's the side of town I was born in
I love her, she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocksEmbed
