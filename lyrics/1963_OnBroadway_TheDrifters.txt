13 ContributorsOn Broadway Lyrics[Verse 1]
They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway (On Broadway)
They say there's always magic in the air (On Broadway)
But when you're walkin' down that street and you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere (on Broadway)

[Verse 2]
They say the girls are something else on Broadway (On Broadway)
But looking at them just gives me the blues (On Broadway)
'Cause how ya gonna make some time when all you got is one thin dime?
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes (On Broadway)

[Verse 3]
Ha! They say that I won't last too long on Broadway (On Broadway)
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say (On Broadway)
But oh! They're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (On Broadway)

[Verse 4]
Oh, they're dead wrong, I know they are 'cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (On Broadway)

[Outro]
On Broadway (On Broadway)
I'm gonna make it, yeah (On Broadway)
I'll be a big, big, big man (On Broadway)
I'll have my name in lights (On Broadway)
Everybody, everybody's gonna know me, yes (On Broadway)
All up and down Broadway (On Broadway)
Oh yeah! (On Broadway)See The Drifters LiveGet tickets as low as $58You might also likeEmbed
