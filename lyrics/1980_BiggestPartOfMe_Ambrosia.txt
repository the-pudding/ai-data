11 ContributorsBiggest Part of Me Lyrics[Intro]
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
(Sunrise) There's a new sun a-risin'
(In your eyes) I can see a new horizon
(Realize) That will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me
(Stay the night) Need your lovin' here beside me
(Shine a light) Need you close enough to guide me
(All my life) I've been hopin' you would find me
You're the biggest part of me

[Chorus]
Well, make a wish, baby
Well, and I will make it come true
Make a list, baby
Of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk, now
In lettin' my love rain down on you
So we could wash away the past
So that we may start anew

[Verse 2]
(Rainbow) Risin' over my shoulder
(Love flows) Gettin' better as we're older
(All I know) All I wanna do is hold her
She's the life that breathes in me
(Forever) Got a feelin' that forever
(Together) We are gonna stay together
(Forever) For me, there's nothin' better
You're biggest part of me

[Bridge]
More than an easy feelin', she brings joy to me
How can I tell you what it means to me?
Flow like a lazy river for an eternity
I've finally found someone who believes in me
(Who believes, who believes in me)
And I'll never leave, oh

You're the life that breathes in me
You're the biggest part
Of me, hmm-mmm

You changed my life
You made it right
And I'll be a servant to you
For the rest of my life
Ah, baby, you're the biggest part of me
Yeah, ah-ha, ooh, baby...Embed
