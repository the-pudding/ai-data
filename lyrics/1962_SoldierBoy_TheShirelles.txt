Oh my little soldier boy
I'll be true to you

You were my first love
And you'll be my last love
I will never make you blue
I'll be true to you

In the whole world
You can love but one girl
Let me be the one girl
For I'll be true to you

Wherever you go
My heart will follow
I love you so
I'll be true to you

Take my love with you
To any port or foreign shore
Darling you must feel for sure
And I'll be true to you

Soldier boy
Oh my little soldier boy
I'll be true to youYou might also likeEmbed
