I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind
'Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me, there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

[Bridge]
I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

[Outro]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself3Embed
