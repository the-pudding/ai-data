Hiya, Barbie
Hi, Ken
You wanna go for a ride?
Sure, Ken
Jump in

[Chorus: Lene Nystrøm, René Dif]
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Come on, Barbie, let's go party
I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

[Verse 1: Lene Nystrøm, René Dif]
I'm a blonde bimbo girl in a fantasy world
Dress me up, make it tight, I'm your dolly
You're my doll, rock and roll, feel the glamor in pink
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky-panky

[Refrain: Lene Nystrøm]
You can touch, you can play
If you say I'm always yours, ooh woah
