I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna be stand on the corner Twelfth Street and Vine
I'm gonna be stand on the corner Twelfth Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby and a bottle of Kansas City wine

[Bridge 1]
Well, I might take a train, I might take a plane
But if I could walk I'm going just the same
I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one

(Ah, but you know, yeah, mercy!)

[Instrumental Break]

(Aw, yeah!)

[Bridge 2]
Now, if I stay with that woman I know I'm gonna die
Gotta find a brand new baby, that's the reason why
Going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one

They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me oneEmbed
