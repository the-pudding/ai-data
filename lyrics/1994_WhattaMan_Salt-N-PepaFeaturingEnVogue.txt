52 ContributorsWhatta Man Lyrics[Intro: En Vogue]
Yeah, yeah, hey, ooh, yeah
Uh, hey, hey, hey
Alright (Ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (You got to say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yeah, he's a mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, uh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Salt]
I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are hoes, he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic to let it
Get me involved in that he said, she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it, and believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
Hahaha, you so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby (Ow)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Alright, yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, he's a  mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Ooh-ooh)
What a mighty good man (Uh, you gotta say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yeah, hey)

[Verse 2: Pepa]
My man is smooth like Barry and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home, he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on cloud nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Mine'll rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mack ****
But every time they tried I said, "That's not it"
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like 7-Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find
[Chorus: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, yeah, he's a  mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Ooh, alright)
What a mighty good man (Say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, ooh-ooh)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, I said what a mighty good man)

[Interlude: En Vogue]
You know what I'm sayin'? He's a mighty, mighty good man, y'all
Y'all don't hear me, now check him out

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving, that's why I call him killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker, 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that (I've got a good man)
[Chorus: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, a mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Yeah, talk to 'em)
What a mighty good man (Yes, he is, oh)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (What a mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (He's a mighty, mighty good man, y'all)

[Post-Chorus: En Vogue]
Uh, what a mighty, mighty good man, y'all
Yeah, what a mighty good man
Yeah, hoo
Now break it down
A-break it down a-one time

[Outro: En Vogue]
Good God
Good God
What a man, what a man (Good God)
Good God
What a man, what a man (Good God)
Good God
What a man, what a man (Good God)
Good God
What a man, what a man (Good God)5Embed
