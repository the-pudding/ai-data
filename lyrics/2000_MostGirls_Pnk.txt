14 ContributorsMost Girls Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush that I just did not want
Paid, was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, getting paid was everything

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not every girl, and I don't need that world to validate me
'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart

[Chorus]
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

[Verse 2]
I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be giving you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream

But I'm not every girl, and I don't need no G to take care of me
'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no, no

[Chorus]
Most girls want a man with the bling bling (Most girls)
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
Most girls want a man with the bling bling (Most girls)
Got my own thing, got the ching ching (Got my own)
I just want real love (I just want real love)
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

[Interlude]
But I'm not every girl
And I don't need no G to take care of me, no
'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart (Oh, most girls)
[Chorus]
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love (I just want real love)
(Can you give me real love?)
Most girls want a man with the mean green (Most girls)
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching (Want my own)
I just want real love (Real love)
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
(I dream of)
A man that understands real love

[Outro]
'Cause I'm not most girls
Don't wanna dance if he can't be
Oh, everything
I, I just want real love, said I gotta have real love
Everything that, can you be everything that I dream of?6Embed
