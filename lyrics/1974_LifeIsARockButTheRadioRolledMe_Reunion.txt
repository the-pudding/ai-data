27 ContributorsLife Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me) LyricsB.B. Bumble and the Stingers
Mott the Hoople, Ray Charles Singers
Lonnie Mack and twangin' Eddy
Here's my ring, we're goin' steady
Take it easy, take me higher
Liar liar, house on fire
Locomotion, Poco, passion
Deeper Purple, Satisfaction
Baby baby, gotta gotta
Gimme gimme, gettin' hotter
Sammy's cookin', Lesley Gore
And Ritchie Valens, and The Stories
Mahavishnu, Fujiyama
Kama Sutra, rama-lama
Richard Perry, Spector, Barry
Rodgers-Hart, Nilsson Harry
Shimmy shimmy, ko-ko bop
And Fats is back and Finger Poppin'

[Chorus]
Life is a rock, but the radio rolled me
Gotta turn it up louder, so my DJ told me
Life is a rock, but the radio rolled me
At the end of my rainbow lies a golden oldie

FM, AM, hits are clickin'
While the clock is tock-a-tickin'
Friends and Romans, salutations
Brenda and the Tabulations
Carly Simon, Noddy Holder
Rolling Stonin' centerfolder
Johnny Cash and Johnny Rivers
Can't stop now, I got the shivers
Mungo Jerry, Peter Peter
Paul and Paula and Mary Mary
Dr. John the Nightly Tripper
Doris Day and "Jack the Ripper"
Gotta go sir, gotta swelter
Leon Russell, "Gimme Shelter"
Miracles in Smokey places
Slide guitars and Fender basses
Mushroom omelet, Bonnie Bramlett
Wilson Pickett, stop and kick it

Life is a rock, but the radio
Life is a rock, but the radio

[Chorus]
Life is a rock, but the radio rolled me
Gotta turn it up louder, so my DJ told me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Life is a rock, but the radio rolled me, yeah
At the end of my rainbow lies a golden oldie
Listen (Remember?)
They're playing our song
Rock it, sock it, Alan Freed, me
Murray Kaufman, try to leave me
"Fish" and "Swim" and "Boston Monkey"
Make it bad and play it funky
(Wanna take you higher)

Freddie King and Albert King
B.B. King and frolicking
Get it on and Nat Gerardi
