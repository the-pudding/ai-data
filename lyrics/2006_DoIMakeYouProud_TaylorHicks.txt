4 ContributorsDo I Make You Proud Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall

[Verse 2]
My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning

[Chorus]
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

[Verse 3]
I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know
I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe
You might also like[Chorus]
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

[Bridge]
Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved

[Chorus]
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now (stronger than I've ever been)
Never been afraid of standing out (never been afraid)
But do I make you proud?
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud?
But do I make you proud?
[Outro]
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proudEmbed
