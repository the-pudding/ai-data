2 ContributorsTimberg Anthem (Timber by Pitbull and Ke$ha parody) Lyrics[Chorus: SuperKoolGamer0]
It's goin' down
I'm buildin' Timberg
You better play
You better build
Let's make a town
You will remember
This is the one
You won't forget

[Bridge: SuperKoolGamer0, ChizzFace32]
Woah, (Timberg)
Woah, (Timberg)
Woah oh, oh (It's goin' down)
Woah, (Timberg)
Woah, (Timberg)
Woah oh, oh (It's goin' down)

[Verse 1: ChizzFace32]
The better they are, the better they build
This biggity boy's a skeleton's bow
I have 'em like Tommy Simons, minds blown
Griefin' all our builds and farms, (Timberg)
Face up, smiles wide, (Timberg)
That's the way we like the town, (Timberg)
I'm slimmer than an armor stand
He says he won't, but I bet he will, (timberg)

(Woo!) Swing your cobble 'round and 'round
End o' the night, you'll have a house
One more tree, another home
End of the night, you'll have a town
Swing your armor 'round and 'round
End o' the night, it's goin' down
One more place, another block
End o' the night, it's goin' down

[Chorus: SuperKoolGamer0]
It's goin' down
I'm buildin' Timberg
You better play
You better build
Let's make a town
You will remember
This is the one
You won't forget
It's goin' down
I'm buildin' Timberg
You better play
You better build
Let's make a town
You will remember
This is the one
You won't forget

Woah, (Timberg)
Woah, (Timberg)
Woah oh, oh (It's goin' down)
Woah, (Timberg)

Woah oh, oh (It's goin' down)

[Verse 2: ChizzFace32]
Look up in the sky, it's a bat, it's the rain
Nah, it's just grief, those people ain't changed
Live near oak, swing axes all day
Blessed to say, creative ain't a thing
MLG like Dream, (Super)
Find another breed of wood? (Homie)
We about to mine, why?
'Cause we're about to go down

[Pre-Chorus: ChizzFace32]
Swing your cobble 'round and 'round
End o' the night, you'll have a house
One more tree, another home
End of the night, you'll have a town
Swing your armor 'round and 'round
End o' the night, it's goin' down
One more place, another block
End o' the night, it's goin' down
[Chorus: SuperKoolGamer0, ChizzFace32]
It's goin' down
I'm buildin' Timberg
You better play
You better build
Let's make a town
You will remember
This is the one
You won't forget
It's goin' down
I'm buildin' Timberg
You better play (You better play)
You better build (You better build)
Let's make a town (Make a town)
You will remember
This is the one
You won't forget (You won't forget)
