6 ContributorsShow and Tell Lyrics[Verse 1]
These are the eyes
That never knew how to smile
Till you came into my life (Do-do-do-do-do)
And these are the arms
That long to lock you inside
Every day and every night (Do-do-do-do-do)

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, and here is the soul
Oh which you've taken control
Can't you see, I'm tryin' to show love is right

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby

[Verse 2]
These are the hands
That can't help reaching for you
If you're anywhere in sight
(Anywhere in sight)
And these are the lips
That can't help calling your name
In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, and here is the man
Who needs to know where you stand
Don't you know I've done all I can?
So decide

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way, too
Say you do, say you do, baby, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Ahh, and here is the soul
Of which you've taken control
Can't you see, I'm tryin' to show love is right

[Chorus]
Ooh, girl, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say, "Oh, I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do, baby
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "Oh, I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby, baby2Embed
