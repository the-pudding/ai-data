38 Contributors25 or 6 to 4 Lyrics[Verse 1: Peter Cetera]
Waiting for the break of day
Searching for something to say
Flashing lights against the sky
Giving up, I close my eyes

[Chorus: All]
Sitting cross-legged on the floor
Twenty-five or six to four

[Verse 2: Peter Cetera]
Staring blindly into space
Getting up to splash my face
Wanting just to stay awake
Wondering how much I can take

[Chorus: All, Peter Cetera]
Should I try to do some more?
Twenty-five or six to four
Oh yeah
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3: Peter Cetera]
Feeling like I ought to sleep
Spinning room is sinking deep
Searching for something to say
Waiting for the break of day
