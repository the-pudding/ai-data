I told this heart of mine our love could never be
But then I hear your voice and something stirs inside of me
Somehow I can't dismiss the memory of your kiss
I guess my heart has a mind of its own

[Verse 2]
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
No matter how I try, I just can't turn the other way
When I'm with someone new, I always think of you
I guess my heart has a mind of its own

[Bridge]
You're not in love with me, so why can't I forget?
I'm just your used-to-be, it's wrong, and yet

[Verse 3]
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing
For I'm a puppet and I just can't seem to break the string
I say I'll let you go but then my heart says "No"
I guess my heart has a mine of its own
Guess my heart has a mind of its ownYou might also likeEmbed
