5 ContributorsBreak Up to Make Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me what's wrong with you now, tell me why I
Never seem to make you happy though heaven knows I try
What does it take to please you? Tell me just how
I can satisfy you woman, you're drivin' me wild

[Chorus]
Break up to make up, that's all we do
First you love me then you hate me
That's a game for fools
Break up to make up that's all we do
First you love me then you hate me
That's a game for fools

[Verse 2]
When I come home from workin', you're on the phone
Talkin' about how bad I treat you, now tell me I'm wrong
You say it's me who argues, I'll say it's you
We have got to get together or baby, we're through

[Chorus]
Break up to make up, that's all we do
First you love me then you hate me
That's a game for fools
Break up to make up, that's all we do
Yeah, first you love me then you hate me
That's a game for fools

[Chorus Outro]
Break up to make up, that's all we do
Yeah, first you love me then you hate me
That's a game for fools
Break up to make up, that's all we do
First you love me then you hate me
That's a game for foolsEmbed
