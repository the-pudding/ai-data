2 ContributorsWhen I Looked at Him Lyrics[Intro: Jeanette]
Ooh, ooh yeah

[Verse 1: Jeanette, All]
I've never known someone before
Who feels the way you do
All my dreams somehow came true with you
And I've never wanted someone more
As much as I want you
Love will last forever, it's true, with you
I will always fear (I will always fear)
Awaking in the night and not having you by my side

[Pre-Chorus: Jeanette, All]
(It's not a dream)
We all need love and understanding
(We must break through)
And make a love that's everlasting
We'll be as one, I can see it in your eyes

[Chorus: Jeanette, All]
(When I looked at him) When I looked at him
(And he turned to me)
(He said you're more than a friend)
(To love, to need) To love, to need
(When I looked at him) When I looked at him
(And he held me so tight)
(When I looked at him, it's love eternally) Eternally

They say I should be acting cool
They tell me I'm a fool
But they don't see the things I see in you
We cannot forget (we cannot forget)
The changes we've been through
I could never love someone new

[Pre-Chorus: Jeanette, All]
(Don't say goodbye)
It would tear in two my heart
(The time is right)
And we could never be apart
We'll be as one, I can see it in your eyes

[Chorus: Jeanette, All]
(When I looked at him) When I looked at him
(And he turned to me)
(He said you're more than a friend)
(To love, to need) To love, to need
(When I looked at him) When I looked at him
(And he held me so tight)
When I looked at him, it's love eternally

[Saxophone Solo]
[Pre-Chorus: Jeanette, All]
(It's not a dream)
We all need love and understanding
(We must break through)
And make a love that's everlasting
We'll be as one, I can see it in your eyes

[Chorus: Jeanette, All]
(When I looked at him) When I
(And he turned to me) Looked at him
(He said you're more than a friend)
(To love, to need) To love, to need
(When I looked at him) When I looked at him
(And he held me so tight)
(When I looked at him, it's love eternally) Eternally

(When I looked at him) When I looked at him
(And he turned to me)
(He said you're more than a friend)
(To love, to need) To love, to need
(When I looked at him)
(And he held me so tight) And he held me tight
(When I looked at him, it's love eternally) Eternally

(When I looked at him) When I looked at him
(And he turned to me)
(He said you're more than a friend)

(When I looked at him)
(And he held me so tight)
(When I looked at him, it's love eternally) Eternally
(When I looked at him) When I looked at him
(And he turned to me) And he held me tight
(He said you're more than a friend)
(To love, to need) To love, to need
(When I looked at him)
(And he held me so tight) And he held me tight
(When I looked at him, it's love eternally) When I looked at himEmbed
