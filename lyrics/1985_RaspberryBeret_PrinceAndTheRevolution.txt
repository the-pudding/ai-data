46 ContributorsRaspberry Beret Lyrics[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, uh!

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

[Chorus]
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

[Verse 2]
Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and, uh, we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said, now, overcast days never turned me on
But something 'bout the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright, but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
You might also like[Chorus]
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

[Verse 3]
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again, ooh
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause, baby, I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

[Chorus]
(Raspberry beret) Oh!
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second-hand store)
Oh, no, no
(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)
Aah!
I think I, I think I, I think I love her!
(Raspberry beret)
No, no, no
No, no, no (The kind you find)
(In a second-hand store)
(Raspberry beret)
Tell me
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)
Ooh, uh, I think I love13Embed
