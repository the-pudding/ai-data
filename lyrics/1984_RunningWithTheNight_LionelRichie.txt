The heart of the city streets was beating
Lights from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

[Chorus]
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I 'til the morning light
We were running, oh
Running with the night

[Verse 2]
You were looking so good, girl, heads were turning
You and me on the town, ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us, we were burning
We were gonna go all the way and we never had a doubt

[Chorus]
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I 'til the morning light
We were running, whoa, ah
Running with the night

We were so in love, you and me
On the boulevard wild and free
Giving all we got, we laid it down
Taking every shot, we took the town

[Chorus]
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
Girl, it was so right, so right (We were running)
Running with the night

[Refrain]
Just you and I

[Chorus]
(Running with the night) We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
Girl, it was so right
(We were running)
Girl, it was so right (Running with the night)
So right, so right1Embed
