21 ContributorsLoser Like Me Lyrics[RACHEL & (SANTANA)]
Yeah, you may think that I'm a zero (Huh)

[RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS, (RACHEL)]
(But) Hey, everyone you wanna be
Probably started off like me

[RACHEL & (SANTANA)]
You may say that I'm a freak show (I don't care)

[RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS, (RACHEL)]
(But) Hey, give it just a little time
I bet you're gonna change your mind

[RACHEL, (FINN & RACHEL)]
All of the dirt you've been throwing my way
It ain't so hard to take (That's right)

[RACHEL (with NEW DIRECTIONS)]
'Cause (I know one day you'll be screaming my name)

[RACHEL, (FINN & RACHEL)]
And I'll just look away (That's right)

[RACHEL with MIKE, PUCK, SAM & NEW DIRECTIONS, (FINN & RACHEL)]
Just go ahead and hate on me and run your mouth
(So everyone can hear)
Hit me with the worst you've got and knock me down
(Baby, I don't care)
Keep it up and soon enough you'll figure out
You wanna be, you wanna be
A loser like me
A loser like me
You might also like[FINN]
Push me up against the locker

[FINN with MIKE, PUCK, SAM & NEW DIRECTIONS, (FINN)]
(And) Hey, all I do is shake it off
I'll get you back when I'm your boss

[FINN]
I'm not thinking 'bout you haters

[FINN with MIKE, PUCK, SAM & NEW DIRECTIONS, (FINN)]
(Cause) Hey, I could be a superstar
I'll see you when you wash my car

[RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS]
All of the dirt you've been throwing my way

[RACHEL, (FINN & RACHEL)]
It ain't so hard to take (That's right)

[RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS, (RACHEL)]
('Cause) I know one day you'll be screaming my name

[RACHEL, (FINN & RACHEL)]
And I'll just look away (That's right)
[RACHEL with MIKE, PUCK, SAM & NEW DIRECTIONS, (FINN & RACHEL)]
Just go ahead and hate on me and run your mouth
(So everyone can hear)
Hit me with the worst you've got and knock me down
(Baby, I don't care)
Keep it up and soon enough you'll figure out
You wanna be, you wanna be
A loser like me
A loser like me

[RACHEL]
A loser like me

[BRITTANY & SANTANA with NEW DIRECTIONS, (MIKE, PUCK & SAM with NEW DIRECTIONS)]
Hey, you, (Oh) over there (Oh)
Keep the "L" (Oh) up-up in the air (Oh)
Hey, you, (oh) over there (Oh)
Keep the "L" up, (Oh) cause I don't care (Oh)
You can throw your sticks (Oh)
And you can throw your stones (Oh)
Like a rocket, (oh) just watch me go (Oh)
Yeah, (Oh) l-o-s-e-r (Oh)
I can only be who I are

Just go ahead and hate on me
And run your mouth

[FINN & RACHEL]
So everyone can hear

[RACHEL with MIKE, PUCK, SAM & NEW DIRECTIONS, (FINN & RACHEL)]

Keep it up, and, soon enough, you'll figure out
You wanna be, you wanna be
A loser like me

[RACHEL with MIKE, PUCK, SAM & NEW DIRECTIONS, (FINN & MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS), {FINN & RACHEL with NEW DIRECTIONS}, (MERCEDES), (& MERCEDES)]

Hit me with the worst you've got and knock me down
{Baby, I don't care}
Keep it up, and, soon enough, you'll figure out (Oh)
You wanna (Be), you wanna be
