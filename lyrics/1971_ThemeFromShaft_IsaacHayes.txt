25 ContributorsTheme from Shaft Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
(Shaft)
Ya damn right

[Verse 2]
Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?
(Shaft)
Can you dig it?

[Verse 3]
Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?
(Shaft)
Right on

[Bridge]
They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother...
(Shut your mouth)
I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft
(Then we can dig it)

[Outro]
He's a complicated man
But no one understands him but his woman
