One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
I just want to celebrate another day of livin'
I just want to celebrate another day of life

[Verse 1]
I put my faith in the people
But the people let me down
So I turned the other way
And I carry on, anyhow

[Chorus]
That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate, yeah, yeah
Another day of living, yeah
I just want to celebrate another day of life

[Verse 2]
Had my hand on the dollar bill
And the dollar bill flew away
But the sun is shining down on me
And it's here to stay

[Chorus]
That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate, yeah, yeah
Another day of living, yeah
I just want to celebrate another day of livin'
I just want to celebrate another day of life

Don't let it all get you down, no, no
Don't let it turn you around and round and round and round and round
Well, I can't be bothered with sorrow
And I can't be bothered with hate, no, no
I'm using up the time but feeling fine, every day

[Chorus]
That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate, oh, yeah
I just want to celebrate another day
Oh, I just want to celebrate another day of livin'
I just want to celebrate another day of life

[Bridge]
Don't let it all get you down, no, no
Don't let it turn you around and round
Round, round, round
Don't go round

[Outro]
I just want to celebrate
I just want to celebrate
Well, I just want to celebrate
Said I just want to celebrate (Celebrate)
I just want to celebrate (I want to celebrate)
I just want to celebrate (I got to celebrate)
I just want to celebrate2Embed
