Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere, mm
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

[Post-Chorus: Thea Austin]
Oh, it's a passion
Oh, you can feel it in the air
Oh, it's a passion
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Thea Austin]
Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere, mm
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

[Post-Chorus: Thea Austin]
Oh

[Verse 1: Daniel Iribarren]
How very like the future this place might be
It's a tiny world just big enough to support the cubicle of one Knowledge Worker
Feel a wave of loneliness, head back down
But I'm going too fast
You might also like[Chorus: Thea Austin]
Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere, mm
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

[Post-Chorus: Thea Austin]
Oh

[Verse 2: Daniel Iribarren]
I plunge right on through the office door and into the bottomless indigo below
Suddenly, I can't remember how to stop, turn around
Do I point behind myself?
Do I have to turn around before I can point?
I flip into a brain fugue

[Chorus: Thea Austin]
Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere, mm
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air
[Post-Chorus: Thea Austin]
