8 ContributorsTo Know Him, Is to Love Him Lyrics[Verse 1]
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worth while
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)

[Verse 2]
I'd be good to him
I'd bring love to him
Everyone says they'll come a day
When I'll walk along side of him
Yes, yes to know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)

Why can't he see?
How blind can he be?
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me
Oh, oh, yes

[Verse 1]
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
Yes, I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
Yes, I do...Embed
