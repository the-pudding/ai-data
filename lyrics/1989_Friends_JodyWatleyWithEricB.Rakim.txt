24 ContributorsDumbfoundead vs. Tantrum Lyrics[Round 1: Tantrum]
Yo, see I ain’t from here. In my world we don’t fight for peace and love
So I’m on a mission to prove your life is freaking done
I traveled space and time to meet with Dumb
Here I am so I can kill the whack version of me, so I can be “the one”
Now your career’s dead you should be making a eulogy
Your music’s only respected in our native community
So how the fuck are you going to take on a true MC
When you look like the Asian Illusion Z who failed at puberty
You nerdy bitch, you shouldn’t fucking start shit
If you’re a thirsty fish, I’m a hungry shark bitch
Who the fuck viewed this mark as a battle event
This video game freak went stark mad for Dragon Quest
Your parents had to cut your allowance and leave your nark ass with half a cent
Cuz you spent all your hard cash on the Starcraft expansion set
What? You think you can flow dog?
Cuz you fucking with the Protoss?
You got no balls. Just been pulled off
You’re so soft. I know we’re family, but bro stop

[Round 1: Dumbfoundead]
Yo, battling another Asian guy sure is simple
It sounds like sound took The Saurus into oriental
I don’t care, man, this cat ain’t ripping me
We’re both Asian, but we were both raised differently
While I was attending funerals and smoking chron
You was playing Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokémon
I was taking hip-hop beyond the limits
You was racing Integras and Honda Civics
I was getting paid and laid by tens
You was acting gay and go raved with friends
Dropping ecstasy without pants, doing some weirdass house dance wearin' Mickey Mouse hands
This motherfucker went from working on railroads to shopping at Melrose
You and the boys locking up elbows talking on cell phones
How you gonna ditch your moms at the nail store to go to the Pharrell show?
Yo, this guy, he ain't just an Uncle Tom, he’s an Uncle Wong
I'ma slap with my drunken palms till you cry to Smashing Pumpkin songs
Yo, don’t rep the Fresh Coast
Just rep the East, or get some better frees
'Cause right now you sound like The Saurus and Illmac with a little bit of MSG
Yo, your last name, I bet it’s Lee
He though Rakim was a Korean guy who hooked up with Eric B

How the fuck are we even related?
Thanks to that last verse the only thing I got for you is brotherly hatred
See for me rhyme scheming tactics is as easy as tai chi and backflips
While your pussy ass eats chai tea ice cream with faggots
You just a right wing fanatic
Who joined the Swim Team cuz you’re too bitch to join the Chinese gymnastics
Yo he’s Asian, but he thinks that sounding white will help
Shit his crew’s the Swim Team. Who you trying to be Michael Phelps?
You’re bona fide trash, wearing them boldly tight pants
You’re that kid our family disowns and rolls their eyes at
You’re only known as the Asian hyped as
That supporting role in movies with a mostly white cast
This fake MC doesn’t like to make cuisine that’s “Asian themed”
He’s into frank and beans, steak and peas, crepes with cheese, and maple leaves
Yo you better leave and hop the border
Or we’ll see if this fish can quench his thirst during Chinese water torture

[Round 2: Dumbfoundead]
This motherfucker seems hella angry
Be mellow stranger
It’s an honor for me to finally meet the bitch behind the yellow ranger
I tried to do some research so I did a search on Google
All I found was pictures of you slurping noodles and hurting poodles
Having oodles of joy. You read books on Confucius and soy
You sound way too much like The Saurus, try to loosen your voice
I know after that battle with Reverse Live, you wanted to reverse life
Cuz you crumbled like that shit was your first fight
What the hell dude? Stop rapping and go sell shoes
After he lost that battle he went to his dad got down on his knees and said, “I have failed you”
Yo you need to use your brain, the same way you strategize on computer games
Username "Liu Kang"
You’re the type of kid to go to the shooting range to soothe your pain
Remember Virginia Tech? You put your school to shame
Ayo look at them they all laugh
This guy left his arm slashed with sharp glass
Because he couldn’t beat a hard ass level on Warcraft
I hope you get in a car crash when you’re at a Chinese restaurant parking cars
You’re the only guy to ever get a pink belt in martial arts
[Round 3: Tantrum]
Look, you the one who had to go insane and leave home for days and pursue a shitty battle career
Mom and Dad would be so ashamed
You shoulda just did what you were made to do
Stop ditching Taekwondo class, played it cool, and stayed in school
Even in here there’s segregation
I’m faster at solving test equations, basically I’m just a better asian
See I spit sicker and I rhyme fresher
I can kick quicker by a high measure
And just to throw it in, my dick’s bigger and I drive better
And you being late is proof that when I’m rapping it’s real
Sahtyre that’s what you get for letting this man get his hands on the wheel
I can’t believe you’re from Cali, you should pack up and move south
Everytime you rap I just wanna bash in this fool’s mouth
Don’t you know you’re that annoying? Quit battling dude, bounce
We only built the great wall to keep faggots like you out
Maybe if you added bass in your voice you wouldn’t sound so much like an alien boy
And you can’t grow to be strong man
Come across every one of life’s obstacles like “aww man, goddamn!”

[Round 3: Dumbfoundead]
Yo I got a lot more skill and you ain’t as passionate
If you’re tantrum, I’m anger management
Yo why you so stiff looking like an Asian mannequin
Take a chill pill Kill Bill, you’re messing with the real deal
You’re the type to get an erection at a steel mill
You saw a girl naked and said, “ew ew”
I think this motherfucker is slightly stupid and I think he might be Buddhist
When the Bay was bringing up the Hyphy movement
He was doing his own thing, the Tai Chi movement
While everybody else was going “dumb dumb”, he was going “om om”
Can you imagine this motherfucker lunging blades in stunner shades
Learning the jumping crane from his uncle Chang
Check this out y’all, I’m a mind reader
You’re thinking of opening up a dry cleaners
That specializes in wife beaters
Yo I don’t even know why the fuck I’m battling this panhandling Mandarin asian
You used to manhandle pandas in cages for gambling wagers
In conclusion, Tantrum’s a hater
Didn’t anybody tell you those pants are for ravers?
How ironic, you just got served in Oakland by a Los Angeles Raider2Embed
