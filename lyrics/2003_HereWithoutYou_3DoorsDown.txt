46 ContributorsHere Without You Lyrics[Verse 1]
A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

[Chorus]
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

[Verse 2]
The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah

Everything I know (Yeah), and anywhere I go (Yeah)
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And when the last one falls (Whoa)
When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love
Whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me

[Outro]
Yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, whoa44Embed
