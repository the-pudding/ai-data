10 ContributorsFallinâ€™ in Love Lyrics[Chorus Intro]
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

[Verse 1]
I could never see what fate had meant for me
And then you came
And made my dreams match reality

Maybe you can see all the things
You've been to me
But my simple fate is at the gate
And girl, you've got the key

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

[Verse 2]
It seems like yesterday
You and I first loved this way
But now, I know how love can grow
With each and every day
You might also likeAs we lay at midnight's hour
And feel love's hidden power
So strong and bold
As life unfolds its mystery to me

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

[Bridge]
You and me for eternity
In love, we'll always be
Young and free and that should be
The way it's gotta be

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again1Embed
