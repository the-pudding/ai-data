15 ContributorsI Want To Be Your Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey lady
Let me tell you why
I can't live my life
Without you (Oh, baby)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time I see you
Walkin' by, I get a thrill
You don't notice me
But in time, you will
I must make you understand

[Chorus]
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Yes I do, yeah, yeah
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Wanna be your man

[Verse 2]
Better not pass me by
'Cause if you do
You'll lose a good thing (Oh, baby)
'Cause what I've got to say
Is sealed with a kiss
And a wedding ring (Wedding ring)
[Pre-Chorus 2]
My mind is blind at times
I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter
No, they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand

[Chorus]
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Yes I do, yeah, yeah
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Wanna be your man

[Verse 3]
Words can never say what I feel
It's too intense (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh)
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
To tell you how I feel
But I get mixed up (So mixed up)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
My mind is blind at times
I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter
No, they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand
[Chorus]
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Yes I do, yeah, yeah
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Wanna be your man

[Chorus/Outro]
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man, yes I do)
(I wanna be your man)
(I wanna be your man)
Wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Yes I do, yeah, yeah
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man3Embed
