3 ContributorsBobbyâ€™s Girl Lyrics[Intro]
(You're not a kid anymore)
(You're not a kid anymore)

[Verse 1]
When people ask of me
"What would you like to be
Now that you're not a kid anymore?" (You're not a kid anymore)
I know just what to say
I answer right away
There's just one thing I've been wishing for

[Chorus]
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
That's the most important thing to me
And if I was Bobby's girl
If I was Bobby's girl
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be

[Verse 2]
Each night I sit at home
Hoping that he will phone
But I know Bobby has someone else (You're not a kid anymore)
Still in my heart I pray
That soon will come a day
When I will have him all to myself
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
That's the most important thing to me
And if I was Bobby's girl
If I was Bobby's girl
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be

[Outro]
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be...Embed
