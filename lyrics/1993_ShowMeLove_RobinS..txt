Ahh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
You've got to show me love

[Verse 1]
Heartbreaks and promises, I've had more than my share
Iâ€™m tired of givin' my love and gettin' nowhere, nowhere
What I need is somebody who really cares
I really need a lover, a lover that wants to be there
It's been so long since I touched a wantin' hand
I can't put my love on the line, that I hope you'll understand

[Chorus]
So baby, if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, alright?
You've got to show me love

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of gettin' caught up in those one night affairs
What I really need is somebody who will always be there
Don't you promise me the world, all that I've already heard
This time around for me baby, actions speak louder than words

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're lookin' for devotion, talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed
You might also like[Chorus]
So baby, if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, alright?
You've got to show me love

[Verse 3]
Show me, show me baby
You've got to give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, yeah
I don't want no fakes, don't want no phoney
I need you love
Show me, show me, show me baby
Give it to me, give it to me
I am not a toy, I'm not a play thang
You've got to understand

[Outro]
If you're lookin' for devotion, talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah5Embed
