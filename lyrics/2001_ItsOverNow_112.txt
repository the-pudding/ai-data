What is this, numbers in your pocket?
I remember when you used to throw those things away
Why do you wanna keep in touch now?
Who gave you a reason to act so shady?

[Pre-Chorus: 112 and Daron Jones]
Baby, you know, you can call me anytime
Anything you needed, I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you
Wanna act now, never call me back now
Turnin' off your cell phone, girl you know that ain't cool
I don't understand, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl, we don't even kiss
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (It's over now)

[Verse 2: Slim]
You think that I don't know what's goin' on
'Cause you're always home alone
And I'm always out of town
You need to stop trying to play me
'Cause you can't even fade me
I know you're messin' around, baby
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: 112 and Slim]
Baby, you know, you can call me anytime
Anything you needed, I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you
Wanna act now, never call me back now
Turnin' off your cell phone, girl you know that ain't cool
I don't understand, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
(Girl, we don't even kiss anymore, tell me why?)
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (It's over now)
(We don't even talk no more)
Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
(It's a shame)
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
(Girl, we don't even kiss, don't wanna fight no more)
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this (Like this)
But it's over now (It's over now)

[Bridge: Daron Jones & Slim]
Baby, it's a shame, shame that we go through
The things that we go through
When you're in love with me, and I'm in love with you
I think that we should talk, talk about our problems
Instead of running away
Oh baby, it's a shame, we couldn't work it out
Forgot what love was all about (The feelings we had from the start)
The feelings we had, my heart will always be with you
Girl, it's a shame
[Chorus]
Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (It's over now)
Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (It's over now)
Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (It's over now)Embed
