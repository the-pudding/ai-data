To everything (Turn, turn, turn)
There is a season (Turn, turn, turn)
And a time to every purpose under heaven

[Verse 1]
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep

[Chorus]
To everything (Turn, turn, turn)
There is a season (Turn, turn, turn)
And a time to every purpose under heaven

[Verse 2]
A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together

[Chorus]
To everything (Turn, turn, turn)
There is a season (Turn, turn, turn)
And a time to every purpose under heaven
You might also like[Verse 3]
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracing

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
To everything (Turn, turn, turn)
There is a season (Turn, turn, turn)
And a time to every purpose under heaven

[Verse 4]
A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time for love, a time for hate
A time for peace, I swear it's not too late6Embed
