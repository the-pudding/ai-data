11 ContributorsMad About You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm mad about you
You're mad about me, babe
Couple of fools run wild, aren't we?
Pushing the day into the nighttime
Somewhere between the two, we start to see

[Chorus]
Mad about you (Mad about you)
Lost in your eyes (Reason aside)
Mad about love (Mad about you)
You and I

[Verse 2]
Something about you right here beside me
Touches the touched part of me like I can't believe
Pushing the night into the daytime
Watching the sky's first light
While the city sleeps

[Chorus]
Mad about you (Mad about you)
Lost in your eyes (Reason aside)
Mad about love (Mad about you)
You and I
