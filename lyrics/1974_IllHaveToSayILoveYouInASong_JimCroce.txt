Well, I know it's kinda late
I hope I didn't wake you
But what I gotta say can't wait
I know you'd understand

[Chorus]
Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So, I'll have to say "I love you" in a song

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know it's kinda strange
Every time I'm near you
I just run out of things to say
I know you'd understand

[Chorus]
Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So, I'll have to say "I love you" in a song

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Every time the time was right
All the words just came out wrong
So, I'll have to say "I love you" in a song

Yeah, I know it's kinda late (It's kinda late)
Hope I didn't wake you
But there's something that I just got to say
(I know you'd understand) I know you'd understand

[Chorus]
Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So, I'll have to say "I love you" in a song5Embed
