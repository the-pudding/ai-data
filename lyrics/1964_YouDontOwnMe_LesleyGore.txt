You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

[Chorus]
And don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display 'cause

[Verse 2]
You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down 'cause I'd never stay

[Chorus]
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you

[Bridge]
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please
You might also like[Chorus]
And don't tell me what to do
Oh, don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display
I don't tell you what to say
Oh, don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you

[Outro]
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free11Embed
