This ain't Texas (Woo)
Ain't no hold 'em (Hey)
So lay your cards down, down, down, down
So park your Lexus (Woo)
And throw your keys up (Hey)
Stick around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (Stick around)
And I'll be damned if I can't slow-dance with you
Come pour some sugar on me, honey, too
It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown
Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo, ha (Woo)

[Verse 1]
There's a tornado (There's a tornado)
In my city (In my city)
Hit the basement (Hit the basement)
That shit ain't pretty (That shit ain't pretty)
Rugged whiskey (Rugged whiskey)
'Cause we survivin' ('Cause we survivin')
Off red-cup kisses, sweet redemption, passin' time, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, one step to the right
We heading to the dive bar we always thought was nice
Ooh, run me to the left
Then spin me in the middle, boy, I can't read your mind

And I'll be damned if I can't slow-dance with you
Come pour some sugar on me, honey, too
It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown
Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo
And I'll be damned if I cannot dance with you
Come pour some liquor on me, honey, too
It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown
Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo

[Post-Chorus]
Woo-hoo

[Verse 2]
There's a heatwave (There's a heatwave)
Comin' at us (Comin' at us)
Too hot to think straight (Too hot to think straight)
Too cold to panic (Cold to panic)
All of the problems
Just feel dramatic (Just feel dramatic)
And now we're runnin' to the first bar that we find, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, one step to the right
We heading to the dive bar we always thought was nice
Ooh, you run to the left
Just work me in the middle boy, I can't read your mind
