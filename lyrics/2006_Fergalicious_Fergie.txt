(Four, tres, two, uno)
Listen up y'all, 'cause this is it
The beat that I'm banging is delicious

[Verse 1: Fergie]
Fergalicious definition, make the boys go loco
They want my treasures so they get their pleasures from my photo
You can see me, you can't squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Boys just come and go like seasons

[Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie, will.i.am, Derrick Rahming]
Fergalicious (So delicious)
But, I ain't promiscuous
And if you were suspicious
All that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses (Muah!)
That puts them boys on rock, rock
And they be lining down the block
Just to watch what I got (Four, tres, two, uno)

[Chorus: Fergie]
It's so delicious
(It's hot, hot)
It's so delicious
(I put them boys on rock, rock)
It's so delicious
(They want a taste of what I got)
I'm Fergalicious
(T-t-t-t-t-tasty, tasty)

All the time I turn around, brothas gather 'round
Always looking at me up and down, looking at my uh
I just wanna say it now, I ain't trying to 'round up
Drama little mama, I don't wanna take your man (Man)
And I know I'm coming off just a little bit conceited
And I keep on repeatin' how the boys wanna eat it
But I'm tryna tell, that I can't be treated like clientele
