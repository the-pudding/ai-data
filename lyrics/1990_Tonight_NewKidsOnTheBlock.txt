Remember when we said, “Girl, please don’t go”
And how I’d be loving you, forever?
Taught you ‘bout hangin’ tough
As long as you’ve got the right stuff
Didn’t we, girl?
Ooh ooh
Didn’t we, girl?
Aah, aah

[Pre-Hook]
Well, I guess it’s a brand new day after all
Every time we hear the curtain call
See the girls with the curls in their hair
The buttons and the pins and the loud fanfares

[Hook]
Tonight, tonight!

[Verse 2]
Remember when we traveled 'round the world
We met a lot of people and girls
Fan mail from everywhere
Showed us how you care
Didn’t it, girls? Ooh, ooh
Didn’t it, girls? Aah, aah
