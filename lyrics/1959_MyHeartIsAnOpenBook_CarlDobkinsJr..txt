Darlin', just believe your eyes and look

Look, my heart is an open book
I love nobody but you (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Look, look, my heart is an open book
My love is honest and true
(Doo-di-di, doo-di-di, doo-di-di, doot!)

Some jealous so and so (Doo-di-di, doot)
Wants us to part (Doo-di-di, doo-di-di, doo-di-di, doot)
That's why he's tellin' you (Doo-di-di, doot)
That I've got a cheatin' heart

Don't believe all those lies
Darlin', just believe your eyes and

Look, look, my heart is an open book
I love nobody but you
(Doo-di-di, doo-di-di, doo-di-di, doot)

Some jealous so and so (Doo-di-di, doot)
Wants us to part (Doo-di-di, doo-di-di, doo-di-di, doot)
That's why he's tellin' you (Doo-di-di, doot)
That I've got a cheatin' heart
