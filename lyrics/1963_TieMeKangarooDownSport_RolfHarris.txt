There's an old Australian stockman lying, dying
He gets himself up onto one elbow and he turns to his mates
Who are all gathered around and he says:

[Verse 1]
Watch me wallabies feed, mate
Watch me wallabies feed
They're a dangerous breed, mate
So watch me wallabies feed
Altogether now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down

[Verse 2]
Keep me cockatoo cool, Curl
Keep me cockatoo cool
Ah, don't go acting the fool, Curl
Just keep me cockatoo cool
Altogether now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down

He lives somewhere out on the track, Mac

Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down

[Verse 4]
Let me abos go loose, Lou
Let me abos go loose
They're of no further use, Lou
So let me abos go loose
Altogether now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down

Just mind me platypus duck
Altogether now!

Tie me kangaroo down
Tie me kangaroo down, sport

Play your didgeridoo, Blue
Play your didgeridoo

Play your didgeridoo

Tan me hide when I'm dead, Fred

So we tanned his hide when he died, Clyde
And that's it hangin' on the shed!!
Altogether now!
