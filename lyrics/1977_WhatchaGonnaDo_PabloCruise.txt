5 ContributorsWhatcha Gonna Do? Lyrics[Chorus]
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?

[Verse 1]
So you're having trouble with your romance
Well, you better check it out before it goes, yeah
'Cause you might not be seeing things just the way you should
And you don't recognize what everybody knows

[Chorus]
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?

[Verse 2]
And all at once, you're ready to hang it up
(You're ready to hang it up)
'Cause things didn't turn out the way you planned, no
And all your friends, they calling you a fool
'Cause you don't know a good thing
When you got it in your hand
You might also like[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?

[Verse 3]
And all at once, you're ready to hang it up
(You're ready to hang it up)
'Cause things didn't turn out the way you planned, no
And all your friends, they calling you a fool
(You're just a fool)
'Cause you don't know a good thing
When you've got it in your hand

[Chorus]
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?

What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?Embed
