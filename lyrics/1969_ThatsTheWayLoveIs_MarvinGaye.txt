7 ContributorsThatâ€™s the Way Love Is Lyrics[Intro]
Ah, baby

[Verse 1]
After bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times, you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed
Oh, you're left alone and broken-hearted, woo

[Pre-Chorus]
Love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna last, said nobody knows, uh-huh

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, sugar, oh, yeah
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Oh, that's how it is
Oh, that''s how it is, my little darlin'
Yeah, now

[Verse 2]
I know you're walking down a lonesome road
And your heart is carrying a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend (Feel like you ain't got a friend)
Oh, and your whole world's caving in (Whole world, caving in)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, but now is the time to be strong (Now is the time, to be strong)
You gotta forget him now that he's gone (Forget him, now that he's gone)
And remember

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, honey
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, baby, oh, darlin'
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Ah, that's how it is
Oh, my little darlin'
Ah, baby
Hoo!

[Bridge]
Oh, listen to me, little darling

[Verse 3]
The road of love gets rough sometimes
Don't let it get the best of you
Said I've been hurt by love so many times (Been hurt so many times)
So I know just what you're going through (Know what you're going through)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, you wish that you were never born (You wish you were never born)
You gotta forget him now that he's gone (Forget him, now that he's gone)
Just remember
[Chorus]
That's the way love is, baby, ooh
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Ah, that's the way love is, honey, yeah
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Hoo, that's how it is

[Outro]
So wipe away your tears
Love is here today and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
I say all your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
One day gladness, and the next day sadness
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sure 'nuff, how it is)Embed
