9 ContributorsTalk to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can see we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Yes, I see your expression when the phone rings
We both know there's something happening here

There's no sense in dancing 'round the subject
A wound gets worse when it's treated with neglect
Well, don't turn now there's nothing here to fear

[Chorus]
You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby

[Verse 2]
Dusty words lying under carpets
Seldom heard, well, must you keep your secrets
Locked inside
Hidden deep from view

Is it all that hard?
Is it all that tough?
Well, I've shown you all my cards
Well, isn't that enough?
You can hide your hurt
But there's something you can do

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
T-t-talk to me

[Verse 3]
Though we lay face to face
And cheek to cheek
Our voices stray
From the common ground
Where they could meet
The walls run high
To veil a swelling tear
(Tear, tear, tear)
Well, let the walls burn down
Set your secret free
You can break their bounds
'Cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt
'Cause you'll find no danger here

[Chorus]
You can talk to me
Talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby
[Verse 4]
Well, I can see
That expression when the phone rings
And I can see
That we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Is it all that hard?
Is it all that tough?
Well, now you've taken all my dreams
Isn't that enough?

[Outro]
Well, I can see you, baby
Well, I can see you, baby
Talk to me, yeah
Well, I can see
That expression when the phone ringsEmbed
