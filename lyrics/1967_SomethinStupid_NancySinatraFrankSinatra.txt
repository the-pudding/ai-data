31 ContributorsSomethinâ€™ Stupid Lyrics[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Bridge: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"
