11 ContributorsNever Knew Love Like This Before Lyrics[Verse 1.1]
I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

[Verse 1.2]
You are my lovelight this I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all, you're part of me

[Verse 1.3]
Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need I call your name

[Chorus]
Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before

[Verse 2.1]
This feeling's so deep inside of me
Such a tender fantasy
You're the one I'm living for
