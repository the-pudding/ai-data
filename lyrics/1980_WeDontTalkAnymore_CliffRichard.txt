10 ContributorsWe Donâ€™t Talk Anymore Lyrics[Verse 1]
Used to think that life was sweet
Used to think we were so complete
I can't believe you'd throw it away

Used to feel we had it made
Used to feel we could sail away
Can you imagine how I feel today?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it seems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done?

[Chorus]
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep (Sheep)
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Ohoho, we don't talk
Ooohooohooo

Well, it really doesn't matter to me
I guess your leaving was meant to be
It's down to you now, you wanna be free

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I hope you know which way to go
You're on your own again
And don't come crying to me
When you're the lonely one
Remember what you've done

[Chorus]
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep (Sheep), no, no, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Ohoho, we don't talk
Ooohooohooohooo
We don't talk

[Chorus]
But I ain't losing sleep, no
I ain't counting sheep (Sheep), no, no, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
[Outro]
Ohoho
We don't talk
Ahaha, we don't talk2Embed
