6 ContributorsPoetry Man Lyrics[Intro]
And ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah

[Verse 1]
You make me laugh
Cause your eyes, they light the night
They look right though me
La la la la
You bashful boy
You're hiding something sweet
Please give it to me, yeah, to me

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
Talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the Poetry Man
You make things all right
Yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
And ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
You are a genie
And all I ask for is your smile
Each time I rub the lamp
La la la la
When I am with you
I have a giggling teenage crush
Then I'm a sultry vamp, yeah
A sultry vamp
You might also like[Chorus]
Woah, oh
Talk to me some more
You don't have to go
'Cause you're the Poetry Man
You make things all right
Yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
And ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah

[Chorus]
Talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the poetry man
You make things all right

[Post-Chorus]
And ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah

[Verse 3]
So once again
It's time to say, "So long"
And so recall the lull of life
La la la la
You're going home now
Home's that place somewhere you go each day
To see your wife, yeah, yeah, yeah
To see your wife
[Chorus]
Woah oh
Talk to me some more
You know that you don't have to go
You're the Poetry Man
You make things all right, yeah

[Chorus]
Woah oh
Talk to me some more
You know that you don't have to go
You're the Poetry Man
You make things all right1Embed
