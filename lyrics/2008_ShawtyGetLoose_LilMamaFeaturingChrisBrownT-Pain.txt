Greatness plus greatness, equals great greatness
Hey, hey, hey
The way we get loose, we move our shoulders
Forward, hands back
Get it in control like Janet Jack
Get it on the floor, let 'em know what's happenin'

[Verse 1: Lil Mama, Chris Brown]
L-I-L, you better ask somebody
I been on my grind since butt touch potty
Y'all don't really want it with the young hot toddler
With a flow so spec like techno-lotta
It's so sick, how the clock go tick
Keep givin' y'all hits like Tek-Matic
Uh, it's the reason why I spit it how I spit it
When I spit, it's like mucous, gotta get rid of it
These chicks don't pop like me
Un-compatible girl, no comparin' me
And ain't none of y'all scarin' me
Like don't ya wish ya girl was as bad as me? Yeah
With a flow so sick like Twista's
So sweet, but could be cold like a Mistic
Instincts come so smooth like what is it?
BK (Hey), H-Dub, ours like a wizard
You might also like[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty, get loose
Baby, do what you do, lemme see you let down your hair
Shawty, get loose
Hit the dance floor and act like there's nobody else in here
Shawty, get loose
Krump, clown, break it on down, baby, do your thang
Shawty, get loose
P-H-A-T, phat, baby, I ain't even know you can break it down like that

[Post-Chorus: Lil Mama', Chris Brown, T-Pain]
F-First you walk, walk, set, set, blow, blow (Uh-huh)
(That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that)
Then you walk, walk, set, set, blow, blow (Yeah, baby)
(Shawty, get loose)
F-First you walk, walk, set, set, blow, blow (You never know)
(That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that)
Then you walk, walk, set, set, blow (Nappy Boi)
(Shawty, get loose)

[Verse 2: T-Pain, Chris Brown]
What it do? (Do) Teddy to the Piz-ayne (Piz-ayne)
You already know (Know), tell 'em I'm the miz-ayne (Miz-ayne)
Shawty, you ain't messin' with a lizz-ame (Lizz-ame)
I'ma have you loose on the floor
You gon' be steppin' with a cizz-ane
I mind-boggle models with a bottle of somethin' good
I'll take 'em to the hood and have they ass goin' insane
A hard rap artist that hang with singers
So don't think that this thing is hard 'cause, homie, it ain't
I'm loose, loose
You gotta be kiddin' me
You tellin' me, shawty, right here, can take her hair down
And do it like you, you
If all of this is true, you gotta show me what you done told me, now do it
Five, four, three, two, two
You know Pain came to change the game
All the way from the same thang to some of that new, new
Impress me, I want one person (Hey) on this floor to try and test me
Now, shawty, get loose
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty, get loose
Baby, do what you do, lemme see you let down your hair
Shawty, get loose
Hit the dance floor and act like there's nobody else in here
Shawty, get loose
Krump, clown, break it on down, baby, do your thang
Shawty, get loose
P-H-A-T, phat, baby, I ain't even know you can break it down like that

[Post-Chorus: Lil Mama', Chris Brown]
In the crib, in the club, on the block, it don't matter
(That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that)
I-I-It don't, i-i-it don't matter
(Shawty, get loose)
In the crib, in the club, on the block, it don't matter
(That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that)
I-I-It don't, i-i-it don't matter
(Shawty, get loose)

[Verse 3: Lil Mama, Chris Brown]
In the crib, in the club, on the block, it don't matter
I spit stats, four, five, six, a-doo-doo-da-da
How she do, d-d-da like that?
Got the hood on her back and the pockets is fat
Still rollin', rollin' (Left, right)
Shot callin', callin' (That's right)
'Cause my team on the market, famila we 'bout to pop it
Lock, drop and roll like a hip-hop rock show
You never know where my mind gon' go
N-N-Not Puerto Rican, but I like mangos
So smooth on the dance floor (So move on the dance floor)
When you see me comin', I'm runnin' it like a game show
You ain't know? Lil Mama go
She be runnin' and pumpin' to hit you with the bust flow
She's hot
Get loose (Hey) on the floor and I cannot stop, what?
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty, get loose
Baby, do what you do, lemme see you let down your hair
Shawty, get loose
Hit the dance floor and act like there's nobody else in here
Shawty, get loose
Krump, clown, break it on down, baby, do your thang
Shawty, get loose
P-H-A-T, phat, baby, I ain't even know you can break it down like that

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that
Shawty, get loose
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that
Shawty, get loose3Embed
