[Verse 1]
Judy in disguise
Well, that's what you are
Lemonade pies
With your brand new car
Cantaloupe eyes, come to me tonight
Judy in disguise with glasses

[Verse 2]
Keep a-wearing your bracelets
And your new Rara
Cross your heart, yeah
With your livin' bra
A chimney sweep sparrow with guise
Judy in disguise with glasses

[Bridge 1]
Come to me tonight
Come to me tonight
Taking everything in sight
Except for the strings on my kite

[Verse 3]
Judy in disguise
Hey, that's what you are
Lemonade pies
Hey, got your brand new car
Cantaloupe eyes, come to me tonight
Judy in disguise with glasses

(Oh)

[Bridge 2]
Come to me tonight
Come to me tonight
Taking everything in sight
Except for the strings of my kite

[Verse 4]
Judy in disguise
What'cha aiming for?
A circus of horrors, yeah, yeah
Well, that's what you are
You made me a life of ashes

[Outro]
I guess I'll just take your glassesEmbed
