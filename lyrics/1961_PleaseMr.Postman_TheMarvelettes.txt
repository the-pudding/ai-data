(Wait) Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman
(Wait) Wa-a-a-ait, Mr. Postman

[Chorus]
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see  (Whoa, yeah)
Is there a letter in your bag for me? (Please, please, Mr. Po-o-ostman)
'Cause it's been a mighty long time (Whoa, yeah)
Since I heard from this boyfriend of mine

[Verse 1]
There must be some word today
From my boyfriend who's so far away
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter, a letter for me?
I've been standing here waiting, Mr. Postman (Wait, wait for you)
So-o, so patiently (Wait, wait for you)
For just a card or just a letter (Wait, wait for you)
Saying he's returning home to me

[Chorus]
(Please, Mr. Postman)
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see (Whoa, yeah)
Is there a letter in your bag for me? (Please, please, Mr. Po-o-ostman)
'Cause it's been a mighty long time (Whoa, yeah)
Since I heard from this boyfriend of mine

So many days, you've passed me by (Wait, Mr. Postman)
You saw the tears standing in my eye (Wait, Mr. Postman)
You wouldn't stop to make me feel better (Wait, Mr. Postman)
By leaving me a card or a letter

[Chorus]
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see (Postman, postman)
Is there a letter, oh, yeah, in your bag for me? (Postman, postman)
You know it's been so long (Postman, postman)
Yeah, since I heard from this boyfriend of mine (Postman, postman)

You better wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Oh, you better wait a minute
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Please, please, Mr. Postman (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Please check and see just one more time for me

You better wait, wait a minute (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Please, Mr. Postman (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better

Wait a minute, wait a minute (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Wait a minute, please, Mr. Postman, wait
