Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Verse 2]
Won't listen to any advice
Momma's tellin' me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time (All the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Bridge]
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

[Verse 3]
Hey, so I got a question (Yeah)
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement? (Yeah)
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum? (Yeah)
Is my love your drug? (Yeah)
Your drug (Yeah)
Huh, your drug (Yeah)
Huh, your drug (Yeah)
Is my love your drug? (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug (Ooh-woah)
Your love, your love, your love (Ooh-woah)
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug (Ooh-woah)
Your love, your love, your love (Ooh-woah)

[Outro]
Hey
Hey, so...
Your love, your love, your love, your love, is my drug
I like your beard22Embed
