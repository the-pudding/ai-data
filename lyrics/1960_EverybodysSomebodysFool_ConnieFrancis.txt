10 ContributorsEverybody’s Somebody’s Fool Lyrics[Verse 1]
The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean
But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

[Verse 2]
I told myself it's best that I forget you
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I come running back for more

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

[Verse 3]
Someday you'll find someone you really care for
And if her love should prove to be untrue
You'll know how much this heart of mine is breakin'
You'll cry for her the way I've cried for you
You might also like[Chorus]
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's foolEmbed
