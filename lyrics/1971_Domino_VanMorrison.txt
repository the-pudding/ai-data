9 ContributorsDomino Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't wanna discuss it
Think it's time for a change
You may get disgusted
Start thinking that I'm strange
That case I'll go underground
Get some heavy rest
Never have to worry
About what is worst or what is best

[Chorus]
Oh, oh Domino, alright
Roll me over, Romeo
There you go
Lord have mercy
I said: Oh, oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Say it again
I said: Oh, oh Domino
I said: Oh, oh Domino
Dig it

[Verse 2]
There's no need for argument
There's no argument at all
And if you never hear from him
That just means he didn't call
Or vice-a-versa
That depends on wherever you're at
And if you never hear from me
That just means I would rather not

Oh, oh Domino, alright
Roll me over, Romeo
There you go
Lord have mercy
I said: Oh, oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Yeah, alright
Say it again: Oh, oh Domino
Hey, hey!
I said: Oh, oh Domino

[Outro]
Hey, mister DJ
I just wanna hear
Some rhythm and blues music
On the radio, on the radio, on the radio
Alright, alright, alright, uh uh
And the band
