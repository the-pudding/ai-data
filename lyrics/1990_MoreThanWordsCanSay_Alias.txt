8 ContributorsMore Than Words Can Say Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I am
At six o'clock
In the morning
Still thinking about you
It's still hard
At six o'clock
In the morning
To sleep without you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that it might
Seem too late for love
All I know

[Chorus]
I need you now
More than words can say
I need you now
I've got to find a way
I need you now
Before I lose my mind
I need you now

[Verse 2]
Here I am
I'm looking out
My window
I'm dreaming about you
Can't let you go
At six o'clock
In the morning
I feel you beside me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that it might
Seem too late for love
For love
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

[Chorus]
I need you now
Whoa! Oh! Oh!
More than words can say
I need you now
Whoa! Oh! Oh!
I've got to find a way
I need you now
Before I lose my mind
I need you now
More than words can say
I need you now
Whoa! Oh! Oh!
Oh! I gotta hear you say
I need you now
Before I lose my mind
I need you now

[Outro]
I need you now1Embed
