13 ContributorsBring It All To Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Brandi]
There you are
Looking as fine as can be
In your fancy car
I can see you looking at me
What you wanna do?
Are you just gonna sit there and stare?
Baby, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Baby, oh

[Chorus: Natina (Shamari)]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (Bring it all)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
(Baby I don't need, no)
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (Bring it all)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (Hoh-no)

[Verse 2: J.C. Chasez]
Baby, what's the deal?
Would I be too forward if
I told you how I feel
That's just the way I do my thing
I'm so for real
Are you feeling my Timb's, my baggy jeans?
My thug appeal?
Do you like it when a man can keep it real?
Oh
You might also like[Chorus: Natina (J.C. Chasez)]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all, bring it all)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (diamond rings)
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (oh)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (oh baby)

[Bridge (Part 1): Shamari]
Oh, I'll put my pride to the side
Just to tell you how good
You make me feel inside

[Bridge: (Part 2): J.C. Chasez]
There's not a single question
That we can't make this right
Cause it's you I need
Every day and night
Oh baby

[Chorus: Natina (J.C./Shamari)]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all, bring it all/yeah yeah)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (no I don't)
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all/ooh oh)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (oh/ooh)
[Chorus: Natina (Shamari)]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (yeah)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (oh)
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all, bring it all)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (oh woah)

[Chorus: Natina (Shamari)]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (ooh)
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (oh baby)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (bring it all)

[Chorus: Natina (Shamari)]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (oh)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (diamond rings baby)

Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy (oh)3Embed
