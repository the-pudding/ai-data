6 Contributors500 Miles Away From Home Lyrics[Intro]
I'm five hundred miles away from home

[Verse 1]
Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

[Chorus]
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home

[Verse 2; Lines 1-3: Spoken, Line 4: Sung]
I know this is the same road I took the day I left home but it sure looks different now
Well I guess I look different too 'cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way
Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home

[Verse 3]
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home
You might also like[Chorus]
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm still five hundred miles away from home
Lord I'm still five hundred miles away from homeEmbed
