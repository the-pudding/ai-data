6 ContributorsYou Canâ€™t Sit Down LyricsHey pretty baby! (you can't sit down)
A don't you hear the drummer thumpin' (you can't sit down)
You gotta shake it like a crazy (you can't sit down)
Because the band is sayin' something (you can't sit down)
And everybody is a jumpin'(you can't sit down)
You gotta slop, bop, flip flop, hip hop
Never stop
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)

You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground
You're puttin down, a crazy, shout
No, no, you can't sit down, no, no, you can't sit down

When you're on South Street (you can't sit down)
And the band is really bootin' (you can't sit down)
You hear the hip beat with the back beat (you can't sit down)
And you see the gang a groovin' (you can't sit down)
You gotta get your bottom movin' (you can't sit down)
You gotta make it, break it, shake it all around
You can't sit down, you can't sit down

You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground
You're puttin down, a crazy, shout
No, no, you can't sit down, no, no, you can't sit down

[Instrumental]

You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you can't sit down
You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you can't sit down
You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you movin' em down
A crazy shout, you can't sit down

A, yea, yea, yea, hey pretty baby
You know you really dance so fine now
You're really shakin' like a crazy
A don't you down lead the line now
We're gonna do it one more time now
You got to make it, break it, shake it,all around
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)

You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground
You're puttin down, a crazy, shout
No, no, you can't sit down, no, no, you can't sit down

(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground............
