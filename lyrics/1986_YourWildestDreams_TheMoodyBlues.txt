6 ContributorsYour Wildest Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Reflected in your eyes

[Chorus 1]
I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

[Verse 2]
Once the world was new
Our bodies felt the morning dew
That greets the brand-new day
We couldn't tear ourselves away

[Chorus 2]
I wonder if you care
I wonder if you still remember
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

[Bridge]
And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time
You might also like[Verse 3]
Once beneath the stars
The universe was ours
Love was all we knew
And all I knew was you

[Chorus 3]
I wonder if you know
I wonder if you think about it
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

[Ad-libbed Interlude]

[Bridge]
And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays

And when the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time

[Verse 4]
Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Mirrored in your eyes
[Chorus 3]
I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

[Outro]
In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreamsEmbed
