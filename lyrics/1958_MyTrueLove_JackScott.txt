He sent me an angel from heaven above
The stars in the sky He placed in her eyes
She is my true love
The touch of her hand
(My true love, my true love)

Captured my soul
(My true love, my true love)
And the kiss from her lips
(My true love, my true love)
Set my heart aglow
(My true love, my true love)

And I know, from heaven
(My true love, my true love)
From heaven above
(My true love, my true love)
Came my, my true love

Darling I love you
I'll always be true
My prayers, they were answered
When the Lord sent me you

With, love and devotion that I never knew
Until the Lord above sent me you
You might also likeAnd I thank the heavens
(My true love, my true love)
The heavens above
(My true love)
For sending my true love
(My true love)Embed
