5 ContributorsTime Wonâ€™t Let Me LyricsI can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true

Time won't let me.  (Oh no.)
Time won't let me.  (Oh no.)
Time won't let me-e-e-e wait that long

Can't you see I've waited too long
To love you, to hold you in my arms

Time won't let me.  (Oh no.)
Time won't let me.  (Oh no.)
Time won't let me-e-e-e.  Wow!

(Guitar solo)

Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh

I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true

Time won't let me.  (Oh no.)
Time won't let me.  (Oh no.)
Time won't let me-e-e-e wait that long
