24 ContributorsSaturday in the Park Lyrics[Verse 1: Robert Lamm, Peter Cetera, Both]
Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People dancing, people laughing
A man selling ice cream
Singing Italian songs

[Chorus: Robert Lamm (Peter Cetera)]
Eh Cumpari, ci vo sunari
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For Saturday

[Verse 2: Robert Lamm, Peter Cetera, Both (Background)]
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar (Play the song, play the song, play on)
And singing for us all

[Chorus: Robert Lamm (Peter Cetera)]
Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today

Slow motion riders fly the colours of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children, all is not lost
All is not lost, oh no, no

[Verse 3: Robert Lamm, Peter Cetera, Both]
Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July (Yes it is)
Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July
People reaching, people touching
A real celebration
Waiting for us all

[Chorus: Robert Lamm (Peter Cetera)]
If you want it, really want it
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For the day, yeah yeah yeah5Embed
