Tweedily-deedily-dee, tweedily-deedily-dee
Tweedily-deedily dee, tweedily-deedily-dee
Tweedily-deedily dee, tweedily-deedily-dee
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet

[Pre-Chorus]
He rocks in the treetops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singin' his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet

[Chorus]
Rockin' robin, rock, rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin, 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight

[Verse 1]
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singin', "Go, bird, go"

[Chorus]
Rockin' robin, rock, rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin, 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started goin' steady and a-bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

[Pre-Chorus]
He rocks in the treetops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singin' his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet

[Chorus]
Rockin' robin (Tweet, tweedily-dee), rock, rock
Rockin' robin (Tweet, tweedily-dee)
Blow, rockin' robin, 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight

[Verse 2]
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
Started goin' steady and a-bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
[Pre-Chorus]
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singin' his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet

[Chorus]
Rockin' robin (Tweet, tweedily-dee), rock, rock
Rockin' robin (Tweet, tweedily-dee)
Blow, rockin' robin, 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight

[Outro]
Tweedily-deedily-dee, tweedily-deedily-dee
Tweedily-deedily-dee, tweedily-deedily-dee
