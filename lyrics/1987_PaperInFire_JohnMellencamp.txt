9 ContributorsPaper in Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
She had a dream, and boy, it was a good one
So she chased after her dream with much desire
But when she got too close to her expectations
Well, the dream burned up like paper in fire

[Chorus]
Paper in fire, stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire, smokin' up the alleyways
Who's to say the way a man should spend his days?
Do you let it smolder like paper in fire?

[Verse 2]
He wanted love with no involvement
So he chased the wind, that's all his silly life required
And the days of vanity went on forever
And he saw his days burn up like paper in fire

[Chorus]
Paper in fire, stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire, smokin' up the alleyways
Who's to say the way a man should spend his days?
Do you let it smolder like paper in fire?

There's a good life right across this green field
And each generation stares at it from afar
But we keep no check on our appetites
So the green fields turn to brown like paper in fire

[Chorus]
Paper in fire, stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire, blowin' down the alleyways
Who's to say the way a man should spend his days?
Do you let them smolder like paper in fire?
Paper in fire, stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire, blowin' down the alleyways
Who's to say the way a man should spend his days?
Do you let them smolder like paper in fire?
