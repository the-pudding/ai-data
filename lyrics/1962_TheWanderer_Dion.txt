Oh well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are, well you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em; they don't even know my name

[Refrain]
They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around

[Verse 2]
Oh well, there's Flo on my left arm and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl well that I’ll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt and I show her "Rosie" on my chest

[Refrain]
Cause I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around

[Bridge]
Oh well, I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
I with my two fists of iron but I'm going nowhere

Oh yeah, I’m the type of guy that likes to roam around
I’m never in one place, I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
Yeah, I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world

[Refrain]
Yeah I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around

[Repeated Verse 3]
Oh yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place, I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world

[Refrain]
Yeah, cause I'm a wanderer
Yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, around, around
Cause I'm a wanderer
Yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Cause I'm a wanderer
I'm, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around3Embed
