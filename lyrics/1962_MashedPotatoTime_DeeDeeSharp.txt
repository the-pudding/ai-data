(It's the latest, it's the greatest, Mashed Potato)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
A Mashed Potato started long time ago (Wah ooh)
With a guy named Sloppy Joe (Wah ooh)
You'll find this dance is so cool to do (Wah ooh)
Come on baby, wanna teach it to you

[Chorus]
(Mashed Potato) Get up to the beat now
(Mashed Potato) Mmm, come on and twist your feet now, baby
(It's the latest) Come on, honey
(It's the greatest) Come on, baby
(Mashed Potato) Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
And then this dance just grew and grew (Wah ooh)
They look for records they can do it to (Wah ooh)
They found this dance was outta sight (Wah ooh)
Doin' The Lion Sleeps Tonight

They dance alone or a big boss line (Wah ooh)
Then they discovered it's the most, man (Wah ooh)
The day they did it to Please Mr. Postman

Well, they got with it more and more (Wah ooh)
You ought to see 'em around the floor (Wah ooh)
The Mashed Potato took a long, long list (Wah ooh)
They even do it to Dear Lady Twist
