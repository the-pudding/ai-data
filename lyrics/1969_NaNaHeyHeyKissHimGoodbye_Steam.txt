Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye

[Verse 1]
He'll never love you the way that I love you
'Cause if he did, no no, he wouldn't make you cry

[Pre-Chorus]
He might be thrillin' baby, but a-my love (My love, my love)
So dog-gone willin', so kiss him
(I wanna see you kiss him, wanna see you kiss him)
Go on and kiss him goodbye, now

Na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye

[Verse 2]
He's never near you to comfort and cheer you
When all those sad tears are fallin', baby, from your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
He might be thrillin' baby but a-my love (My love, my love)
So dog-gone willin', so kiss him
(I wanna see you kiss him, I wanna see you kiss him)
Go on and kiss him goodbye
