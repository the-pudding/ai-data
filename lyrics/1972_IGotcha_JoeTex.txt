Hey!

[Verse 1]
You promised me the day that you quit your boyfriend
I'd be the next one to ease on in
You promised me it would be just us two, yeah
And I'd be the only man kissin' on you, yeah

Now kiss me!
Hold it a long time, hold it!
Don't turn it a-loose, now, hold it!
A little bit longer, now, hold it

[Verse 2]
You made me a promise and you're gonna stick to it
You shouldn't've promised if you weren't gon' do it
You saw me and ran in another direction
I'll teach you to play with my affection

[Bridge]
Now give it here!
You never should've promised to me, give it here!
Don't hold back now, give it here!
Don't say nothin', just give it here
Come on, give it here, uh!
Give it here, uh!
Give it here!
Give it here!
Give it to me now
Good God, hey!

I gotcha!
Shouldn't've made a promise to me, I gotcha!
You never should've promised to me, gotcha!
Give it on here, I gotcha!
You thought you got away from me, didn't ya?
Good God, I gotcha, ha-ha-ha!
Oh, I gotcha!
Give it on up, I gotcha!
Give it on here, I gotcha!
You tried to sneak by me now, didn't ya?
