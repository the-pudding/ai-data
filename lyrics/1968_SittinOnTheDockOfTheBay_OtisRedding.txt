64 Contributors(Sittinâ€™ On) The Dock of the Bay Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

[Verse 2]
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way

[Chorus]
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

[Bridge]
Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes
You might also like[Verse 3]
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

[Chorus]
Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh-wee, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

[Outro]
