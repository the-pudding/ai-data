20 ContributorsIn Too Deep Lyrics[Verse 1]
All that time I was searching with nowhere to run to
It started me thinking
Wondering what I have could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice
And no one listening

[Pre-Chorus]
All this time
I still remember everything you said, ah-ha
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

[Chorus]
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep

[Post-Chorus]
So listen, listen to me
Ooh, you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why
You might also like[Verse 2]
Ooh, I know you're going, but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all
It may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons, being alone
When I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there
I almost believed you

[Pre-Chorus]
All this time
I still remember everything you said, oh-ho
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

[Chorus]
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep

[Post-Chorus]
So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me
[Pre-Chorus]
It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself, oh
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring about somebody else

[Chorus]
Now listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep
You know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep

[Outro]
(You know I love you, but I just…)
You know I love you, but I just can't take this
(But I just can't take this)
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
(You know I love you)
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
(You know I love you)
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep
(You know I love you, girl)
You know I love you, but I just can't take this
(I can't take this)
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this…2Embed
