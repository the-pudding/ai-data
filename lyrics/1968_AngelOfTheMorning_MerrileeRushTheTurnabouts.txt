4 ContributorsAngel of the Morning Lyrics[Verse 1]
There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no reason to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

[Chorus]
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Then slowly turn away, from me

[Verse 2]
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by light

[Chorus]
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Then slowly turn away
You might also like[Bridge]
I won't beg you to stay with me (Me)
Through the tears of the day
Of the years, baby, baby

[Chorus]
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave meEmbed
