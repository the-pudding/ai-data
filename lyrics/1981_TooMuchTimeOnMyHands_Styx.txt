Yeah, I'm sitting on this barstool, talking like a damn fool
Got the twelve o'clock news blues
And I've given up hope for the afternoon soaps
And a bottle of cold brew

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is it any wonder I'm not crazy?
Is it any wonder I'm sane at all?

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm so tired of losing, I got nothing to do
And all day to do it
Well, I'd go out cruisin', but I've no place to go
And all night to get there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Is it any wonder I'm not a criminal?
Is it any wonder I'm not in jail?

[Chorus]
Is it any wonder I've got too much time on my hands?
It's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands
It's hard to believe such a calamity
I've got too much time on my hands
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me

(It's t-t-t-t-ticking away)
Too much time on my hands
(And I don't know what to do with myself)
Too much time on my hands

[Guitar Solo]

Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm a jet fuel genius - I can solve the world's problems
Without even trying
I got dozens of friends, and the fun never ends
That is, as long as I'm buying

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Is it any wonder I'm not the president?
Is it any wonder I'm null and void?

[Chorus]
Is it any wonder I've got too much time on my hands?
It's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands
It's hard to believe such a calamity
I got too much time on my hands
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me
Too much time on my hands
(T-t-t-t-ticking away)
Too much time on my hands
(And I don't know what to do with myself)
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands
(T-t-t-t-ticking away)
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands
(Too much time on my hands)
(Too much time on my)3Embed
