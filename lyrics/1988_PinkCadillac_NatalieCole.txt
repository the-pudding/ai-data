10 ContributorsPink Cadillac Lyrics[Verse 1]
You may think I'm fooling
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well, baby, you know you bug me
There ain't no secret about that
Well, come on over here and hug me
Baby, I'll spill the facts

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, honey it ain't your money
'Cause I got plenty of that

[Chorus]
I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

[Verse 2]
Well now, way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting you
Into doing something they know is wrong
Well, they tempt you, ma'am, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That flesh does surely hold
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
They said Eve tempted Adam with an apple
Man, I ain't going for that

[Chorus]
I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you're doing in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac, yeah

[Bridge]
Now, now, now, now, some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old
And that it just goes too fast
Oh, but love is bigger than a Honda (Honda)
And it's bigger than a Subaru (That too)
Hey man, there's only one thing
And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey, we can park it out in back
And have a party in your
[Chorus]
Pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in the back
Of your pink Cadillac

[Outro]
You know the one I mean, Le Car
Oh, oh, oh, Cadillac
In the dark, can't do that
When we park in the back of your pink Cadillac (Uh-uh)
Oh, I like what you do when do what you do in your pink
Pretty, pretty, pretty pink Cadillac
In the dark, can't do that
In the back of your pink CadillacEmbed
