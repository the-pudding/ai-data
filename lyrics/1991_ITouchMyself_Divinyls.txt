I love myself
I want you to love me
When I'm feelin' down
I want you above me
I search myself
I want you to find me
I forget myself
I want you to remind me

[Chorus]
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself, ooh
I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
You're the one who makes me come running
You're the sun who makes me shine
When you're around I'm always laughing
I wanna make you mine

[Verse 3]
I close my eyes
And see you before me
Think I would die
If you were to ignore me
A fool could see
Just how much I adore you
I get down on my knees
I'd do anything for you
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself, oh-oh
I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no, yeah

I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
I honestly do
I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
