Somewhere my love there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hope of Spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams, all than your heart can hold

[Bridge]
Someday we'll meet again, my love
Someday whenever the Spring breaks through

[Verse 2]
You'll come to me out of the long-ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
'Til then, my sweet, think of me now and then
Godspeed, my love, 'til you are mine again

[Refrain]
Lara, my own, think of me now and then
Godspeed, my love, 'til you are mine again

[Outro]
