It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

[Verse 1]
If you want me to love you, maybe I will
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

[Chorus]
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you who to sock it to

Alright
Aw, have mercy

[Chorus]
Ah, it's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to, hit me man
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

I'm not trying to run your life
I know you wanna do what's right
Give your love girl, to whoever you choose
How can you lose, with the stuff you use now

[Chorus]
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell you who to sock it to

[Chorus]
Let me hear ya say, "It's my thing (it's my thing)
I do what I want to do
I can't tell you who to sock it to"
Hoo, it's my thing (it's your thing)
I do what I want to do1Embed
