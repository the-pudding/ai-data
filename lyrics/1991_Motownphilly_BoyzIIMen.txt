It don't matter, just don't curse
(Yo fellas, y'all ready to do this?)
(Boyz II Men in effect, yeah)
(It's about time)
(Yo, let's switch this up)
Boyz II Men

[Chorus: All]
Motownphilly back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris & Michael Bivins]
It's long overdue but now
Philly is slammin'
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
The east coast family
Never skipped a beat (Nah)
While cooling on South Street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
And all the Philly steaks you can eat
See Boyz II Men LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like[Verse 2: Wanyá Morris & (Shawn Stockman)]
Back in school
We used to dream about this every day
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing and
They said it sounds smooth
And we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you

[Chorus: All]
Motownphilly back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
[Interlude: Michael Bivins]

Yo, these four new jacks is real
Smooth on the harmony tip

You know the mentality
Keep flippin' the gift

[Verse 3: Shawn Stockman, Nathan Morris]

[Verse 4: Wanyá Morris, All]
Back in school we used to dream about this every day

Now check this out, one day back in Philly
Four guys wanted to sing
They came up to me, I said, "Well, what's your name?
(Boyz II Men!) Hey, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Then I said, "Alright fellas
Well, let me see what you can do"
And then, a smile when that Wanya said
"Yo Mike, check this out, see if this one moves you"
