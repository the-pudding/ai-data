9 ContributorsSo Alive Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't know what color your eyes are, baby
But your hair is long and brown
Your legs are strong, and you're so, so long
And you don't come from this town

[Pre-Chorus]
My head is full of magic, baby
And I can't share this with you
Feel I'm on a cross again lately
But there's nothing to do with you

[Chorus]
I'm alive, huh, huh, so alive
I'm alive, huh, huh, so alive

[Verse 2]
Your strut makes me crazy
Makes me see you more clearly
Oh, baby, now I can see you
Wish I could stop
Switch off the clock
Make it all happen for you

[Chorus]
I'm alive, huh, huh, so alive
I'm alive, huh, huh, so alive
You might also like[Verse 3]
Don't know what color your eyes are, baby
But your hair is long and brown
Your legs are strong, and you're so, so long
And you don't come from this town

[Pre-Chorus]
My head is full of magic, baby
And I can't share this with you
I feel I'm on top again, baby
That's got everything to do with you

[Chorus]
I'm alive, huh, huh, so alive
I'm alive, huh, huh, so alive

[Outro]
