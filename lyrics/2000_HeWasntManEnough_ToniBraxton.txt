24 ContributorsHe Wasnâ€™t Man Enough Lyrics[Intro]
Darkchild, he-he
Whoa-yeah, yeah
Toni Braxton, oh-whoa-yeah
Ha-ha, uh-huh
Yeah, Darkchild, yeah

[Verse 1]
Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him? (Care about him)
Lookin' at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first

[Pre-Chorus]
What you thinkin'? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Stop blamin' me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah?
And not be worried about him, yeah?
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
What are you thinkin'? (Oh-oh, yeah)
Did you know about us back then? (Did you know?)
Do you know I dumped your husband (Ooh-wee), girlfriend (Girlfriend)?
I'm not thinkin' 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave? (Made him say bye-bye)
Do you know he begged to stay with me? (Oh, with me)
He wasn't man enough for me

[Verse 2]
Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not, then why don't you ask him?
Then maybe, you can be more into him
Instead of worryin' about me
And hopefully you won't find
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

[Pre-Chorus]
What you thinkin'?
Stop blamin' me (Ooh, yeah)
He wasn't man enough for me, yeah
If you don't know, now here's your chance
See, I've already had your man, yeah
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah?
And not be worried about him, yeah?
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you
[Chorus]
What are you thinkin'? (Yeah, yeah)
Did you know about us back then? (Did you know?)
Do you know I dumped your husband (Did you know?), girlfriend? (Yeah)
I'm not thinkin' 'bout him
But you married him (Yeah)
Do you know I made him leave? (Do you really know?)
Do you know he begged to stay with me? (Know he begged, beggin' me to stay)
He wasn't man enough for me
What are you thinkin'? (Yeah)
Did you know about us back then? (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you know I dumped your husband (Do you know I dumped your husband?), girlfriend? (That's what I did to him)
I'm not thinkin' 'bout him
But you married him (Yeah)
Do you know I made him leave? (Yes, you did, yeah)
Do you know he begged to stay with me? (Did you really know?)
He wasn't man enough for me (Oh, oh-yeah)

[Bridge]
So many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you?
No, it makes no sense, 'cause he will never change
Girl, you better recognize the game, oh yeah

[Chorus]
What are you thinkin'?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband (Husband), girlfriend (Girlfriend)?
I'm not thinkin' 'bout him
But you married him (A fool will)
Do you know I made him leave? (A fool will, baby)
Do you know he begged to stay with me? (Oh, baby)
He wasn't man enough for me (I said he used to follow me)
What are you thinkin'? (Yeah)
Did you know about us back then? (Callin' me all night long)
Do you know I dumped your husband (Beggin' me to stay), girlfriend? (Yes, you did)
I'm not thinkin' 'bout him (And you've got him now)
But you married him (Ooh, babe)
Do you know I made him leave? (Oh-ooh, baby)
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
What are you thinkin'? (Oh)
Did you know about us back then? (Oh, oh-oh)
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend? (Yeah)
I'm not thinkin' 'bout him (Oh-ah)
But you married him (Callin' on the phone)
Do you know I made him leave? (Askin' me to come back home)
Do you know he begged to stay with me? (Beggin' me if he could stay, but he's not)
He wasn't man enough for me11Embed
