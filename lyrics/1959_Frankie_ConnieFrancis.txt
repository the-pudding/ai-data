6 ContributorsFrankie Lyrics[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Frankie, wherever you are, I love you
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Though you've found a new love
I still miss you so
I just can't forget you
But you'll never know
Frankie, my darling I'll never let you see me cry

[Verse 2]
Once I was your sweetheart
Now I'm just a friend
Once you really loved me
Now I just pretend
Frankie, my darling
I'll never let you see me cry
(Never let you see me cry)

[Bridge]
Oh, Frankie
I'd rather hide these teardrops (Teardeeprops)
D down inside, I'm crying
But you'll never see, I'd rather cry than have you pity me
You might also like[Verse 3]
Though my nights are lonely
Since we've been apart
I'll always keep this secret deep within my heart
Frankie, my darling
I'll never let you see me cry

[Outro]
Frankie, wherever you are, I love you
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)1Embed
