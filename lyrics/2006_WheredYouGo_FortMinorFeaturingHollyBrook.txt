Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, "Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself tryin' to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot working my day around a call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

[Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But, now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine and I'm planning to keep it that way
And you can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

[Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
[Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Post-Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
[Outro: Brad Delson, JAY-Z]
When you made me that initial batch of songs
I was like, "That's the shit right there"
