5 ContributorsI Wanna Love Him So Bad LyricsDown down down down be doo be doo
Down down down down be doo be doo

He lives in my neighborhood
When he walks by, he looks so good
Want to get to know him (oh yeah)
Wish that I could show him (I care)

[Chorus:]
I want to love him so bad
You know it's drivin' me mad
'Cause when I look in his eyes
I can see it, paradise
So I can't help it
I want to love him so bad (love him so bad)

I know his name, his name is Jim
I can't be blamed for lovin' him
I could make him happy (oh yeah)
If he'd only let me (oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I could make him happy (oh yeah)
If he'd only let me (oh yeah)

[Chorus]
[Repeat to Fade]
