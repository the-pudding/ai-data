47 ContributorsLove Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

[Pre-Chorus]
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
(Yeah) Today, yeah

[Verse 2]
I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

[Bridge]
Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say...

[Chorus]
I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Ooh)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this, huh
Is that why you wanted a love song? (Yeah)
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you (I want you) to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas (Walk the seven seas)
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you (Write you) a love song today
Today (Yeah), yeah24Embed
