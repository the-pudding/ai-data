But nobody's
Gonna make you change what you probably
Don't like anyway 'bout you darlin'
So you might as well
Hmm-mmm
Be somebody
Who can make you face what you're guardin'
Open up the gates where your heart is
And just be yourself (ADELSO on this)
Yeah

[Chorus: Toosii]
I'm on the stage right now, singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd, and you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say, "You look good without no make-up, no lashes, even better when you wake up" (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 1: Toosii]
I see the look on your face, I see you're hidin' the hate
I see you're lookin' for someone to scoop you right off of your feet
You want to ride in the Wraith
You want to go out on dates
You want somebody to come bring you flowers
Someone to talk to for hours
Wash your back while y'all sit in the shower (Yeah)
Someone to tell you, "You're beautiful"
Someone to tell you and mean it
Someone to tell you, "I love you" everyday and don't got a reason
You want someone to bring you peace (Uh)
Someone to help you sleep (Yeah)
Someone to pick you up when you're feelin' down, feelin' lonely
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Toosii]
Need somebody who can make it better
Somebody who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you'll let me

[Chorus: Toosii]
I'm on the stage right now, singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd, and you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say, "You look good without no make-up, no lashes, even better when you wake up" (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Toosii]
I see the look on your face, I see you're lookin' for peace
I see you're tired of the hurt, tired of the pain, tired of the nights where you can't get no sleep
I see you're tired thinkin' 'bout if he cheat
See you tired thinkin' 'bout if you're leavin'
See you tired of bein' so tired
And you're damn sure ain't gettin' even

[Pre-Chorus: Toosii]
Need somebody who can make it better
Somebody who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you'll let me

[Chorus: Toosii]
I'm on the stage right now, singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd, and you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say, "You look good without no make-up, no lashes, even better when you wake up" (Oh, oh, oh)
[Outro: Tatiana Manaois]
Gonna make you change what you probably
Don't like anyway 'bout you darlin'
So you might as well
Be somebody
Who can make you face what you're guardin'
Open up the gates where your heart is
And just be yourself
