[Verse 1: Steve Lukather & Bobby Kimball]
All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me
Rosanna
All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be

[Pre-Chorus]
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna, yeah
Now she's gone and I have to say

[Chorus]
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah

[Verse 2: Steve Lukather & Bobby Kimball]
I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad
Rosanna
All I want to tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad
