34 ContributorsAin’t 2 Proud 2 Beg Lyrics[Intro: Left Eye]
Yo, mic check, 1-2, 1-2
We in the house
Yeah, come on
1992, TLC kickin' off in your mother— *bleep* (I ain't too proud to beg)
So ya best be duckin' fast (I ain't too proud to beg)
Yo, T-Boz, is ya being a boss? (I ain't too proud to beg)
Chilli, what's up wit' dat sauce? This is it
Yo, "T", step on that (Shh)
(I ain't too proud, I ain't too proud to beg)

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Thinkin' short of what you got
Better get it while it's hot
Ain't no better love than your own
Unmistakin' urge to be
Sexin' with society
How can you be happy alone? Hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
I need to feel loved
Why wait for so long?
'Cause I ain't too proud to beg
For something that I call my own
And I want to be touched
And feeling so much, see, 'cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'

Yo, if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
(I ain't too proud to beg, no)
If the lovin' is strong then he got it goin' on and...
(I ain't too proud to beg, no)
Two inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
(I ain't too proud to beg, no)
So it ain't like I'm braggin', just join the paddywagon, 'cause
(I ain't too proud to beg, I ain't too proud to beg)

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Screamin' loud and holdin' sheets
Scared that you'll be called a freak
Gotta let it go while you can
Ain't too proud to beg, you see
'Cause my man belongs to me
And I know that he understands

[Bridge: Chilli]
I need to feel loved (I need to feel loved)
Why wait for so long?
'Cause I ain't too proud to beg
For something that I call my own
And I want to be touched (Wanna be touched)
And feeling so much, see, 'cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'
[Chorus: Left Eye & All]
Yo, if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
(I ain't too proud to beg, no)

I ain't too proud to beg, I ain't too proud to beg
Yo, if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
(I ain't too proud to beg, no)

So it ain't like I'm braggin', everybody join the paddywagon, 'cause
(I ain't too proud to beg, I ain't too proud to beg)

[Post-Chorus: Chilli & T-Boz]
Yo, Left Eye, kick that shit

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Realize the realism of reality treats us both the same
'Cause satisfaction is the name of this game
So I choose to explain, it's evident
Left Eye don't mean the rest of my body is irrelevant
In other words, let's refresh your head
About pullin' down curtains and breakin' the waterbed
Yeah, I like it when you (Mwah)
Both sets of lips
Oooh, on the TLC tip
[Pre-Chorus: Chilli with T-Boz]
I ain't too proud to beg (I ain't too proud to beg)
What I call my own (I ain't too proud)
Just you and me (Uh)
Hey
I ain't too proud to beg, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I ain't too proud, I ain't too proud, I ain't too proud to beg

[Bridge: Chilli]
I need to feel loved (I need to feel loved)
Why wait for so long? (Oh so long)
'Cause I ain't too proud to beg
For something that I call my own (Something, yeah)
And I want to be touched (Wanna be touched)
And feeling so much, see, 'cause (Feeling so so much)
Everybody needs some good lovin'
(Everybody need it, everybody need it, everybody need it, oh)
