The right stuff
The right stuff

[Verse 1]
First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love
Now I hope it lasts
I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts
You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You’re the reason why I sing this song

[Pre-Chorus]
All that I needed was you
Oh girl, you're so right
Said all that I wanted was you
You made all my dreams come true

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff

Your first kiss was a sweet kiss
Second kiss had a twist
Third and your fourth kiss
I don't want to miss
I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts
You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You’re the reason why I sing this song

[Pre-Chorus]
All that I needed was you
In my life, you're so right
And all that I wanted was you
You made all (Every one of my dreams come true)

In my life, you're so right
