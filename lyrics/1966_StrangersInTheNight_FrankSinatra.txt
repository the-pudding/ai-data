Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

[Verse 2]
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

[Chorus]
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and

[Verse 3]
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

[Bridge]
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away

[Verse 3]
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
