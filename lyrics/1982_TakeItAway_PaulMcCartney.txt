Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?
Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?

[Verse 1]
Lonely driver out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor carrying the load
Switches on his radio

[Chorus]
Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?
Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?
You might also like[Verse 2]
In the audience watching the show
With a paper in his hand (In his hand, in his hand)
Some important impresario
Has a message for the band
Oh!

[Chorus]
Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down (Down, down)
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?

[Bridge]
You never know who may be listening to ya
(Never know who may be listening to ya)
(You never know who may be listening to ya)
Take it away, take it away

[Verse 3]
After hours, late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat
Faded flowers wade in the jar
Till the evening is complete
(Complete, complete, complete)
[Outro]
(Hah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!)1Embed
