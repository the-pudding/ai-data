Shaky legs don't just stand there
Don't let her know that she's getting through to to you
Talk back trembling lips
Burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let her know that your breaking in two

Every day our love's a battle royal
Dear it seems that fighting is all we do
But if i let you know how much I love you
You'll do things to me you shouldn't do

So talk back trembling lips
Shaky legs don't just stand there
Don't let her know that she's getting through to to you
Talk back trembling lips
Burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let her know that your breaking in two

Every time you up and hurt my feelings
I pretend it couldn't matter less
I'm just hiding all of my emotions
Behind my broken heart I guess

So talk back trembling lips
Shaky legs don't just stand there
Don't let her know that she's getting through to to you
Talk back trembling lips
Burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let her know that your breaking in two
Heart don't let her know that your breaking in twoYou might also likeEmbed
