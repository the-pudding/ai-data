Yeah!
So good
My, my, my, my
You look so sweet
Listen

[Verse 1]
Put on your red dress and slip on your high heels
And some of that sweet perfume, it sure smells good on you
Slide on your lipstick, and let all your hair down
'Cause baby, when you get through I'm gonna show off you

[Bridge]
Tonight will be a special night
No matter where we go
And I'm so proud to be with you
I just want to let you know

[Chorus]
You got my sayin' my, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
And you're so damn fine
I wanna say my, my, my, my, my, my (Uh-huh)
You sure look good tonight (Tonight, after all this time)

Slip on your nightgown, step in our bedroom
First I wanna take some time, I just wanna look at you
Girl, you are so fine, I can't believe my eyes
And all that I wanna do, I wanna make love to you, oh

Tonight will be a special night
A minute more to come
And I'm so proud to be with you
So proud to share your love

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
I wanna say my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Make love all night long, make love till the break of dawn
Come on, come on
Sweet little thing, yes, you do

And I'm so proud to be with you
So proud to share you're love

[Chorus]
You got me sayin' my, my, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
I wanna love you, I want to love you in every, every way
Let me, let me show you how sweet it's gonna be
I wanna show you things that you never
You never, ever, ever seen before
[Bridge]
Put your nightgown on
Let your hair hang low
Step into our room
I'm in the mood to love you all night long
