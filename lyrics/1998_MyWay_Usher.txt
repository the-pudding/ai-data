Yo
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo
See, it's rare that you find people like us
'Cause all y'all other—(Look)
Out there doing what I'm doing
Or tryna do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh? Come on

[Verse 1: Usher]
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want (You can get mad if you want to)
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it—

[Chorus: Usher]
My way (My way)
My way (Oh, oh)
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way
My way (Oh, oh)
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

Bad ass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix (That's right)
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me (Haha, yo)
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it (Yo, yo, yo, yo)
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots (What?)
Saying "You can't front" (And you can't front)
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do? Be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door (Yeah)
Shotgun in my drop, having fun with the Don
System bassing, conversation (See what I mean?)
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, "Give it to me now, baby"

[Chorus: Usher]
My way (Ooh)
My way (Do it, do it)
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way (My way)
My way (Oh woah)
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
[Verse 3: Usher]
Don't check me (Check me)
It was your girl who let me (Let me)
Take it this far, then, ooh wee (Ooh wee)
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gonna give it up
She likes it—

[Chorus: Usher]
My way (Ooh)
My way (My way, my way, my way)
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it (She keeps running back to me)
My way (Oh woah, yeah)
My way
What I say, goes (Goes)
And I'm in control (I'm in control, I'm in control)
My way (Oh, my way)
My way (Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy)
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way (Ooh, my)
My way (Ow)
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way (I'd do anything, everything you want to)
My way (Oh-oh)
You can't satisfy her needs (I'd do anything, everything)
She keeps running back to see me do it (You want me to do)
My way (Do anything)
My way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control3Embed
