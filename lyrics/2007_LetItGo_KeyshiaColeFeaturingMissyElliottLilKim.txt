You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he..
Where he wanna be, yeah, yeah
New Keyshia
Yes! (Woo!)
Fire (Uh-huh)
I like this one right here
This one for all my ladies, y'all
Holla! Mmm
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
I don't want'cho man, 'cause I got it like that
But it ain't even gotta be like dat (Eh-heh-heh-heh-heh)
Yo' man, he be callin' me back
He say I'm fine and a matter of fact (Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh)
He ask how I do that, that fit my jeans over Baby Phat
Listen, I don't know the type of tricks he playin'
But I should warn you, I don't want yo' man (C'mon)

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole & Missy Elliott]
I understand why you wanna try
To make him stay home late at night
But if he wanna go, he'll be gone, no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin' about mine and where he might be
(Baby, I don't wanna know)
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How you love someone who didn't love me? (C'mon)
See Keyshia Cole LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he, where he wanna be

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
(If he ain't gonna) If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it go
(If he ain't gonna) If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go (Let it go)
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
(Let it go) Then let it go

[Interlude: Missy Elliott]
When this song come on in the club, they gon' be like
Damn, that's hot
And when they play it in the car, they gon' drop they tops like
Damn, that's hot (Whoop!)
They gon' mix it with Biggie, "It was all a dream" like
Damn, that's hot
Me and Keyshia don't stop, 'til the tick don't tock like
Damn, that's hot

[Verse 3: Keyshia Cole]
Now understand why I take my time (Time)
Cause you come with alibis (-Bis)
Tryna get me to see that's where you tryna be
But I don't want your man
Your man's been callin' me (Callin' me), tryna get me to see
That he wants me to be with him
But he ain't the one for me
And if you only knew (Only knew)
You would, do what you had to (You would, do)
Finally see that (Finally get the chance to see that)
[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he..
Where he wanna be, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
(If he ain't gonna) If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it go
(If he ain't gonna) If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go (Let it go)
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
(Let it go) Then let it go

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim & Keyshia Cole]
Uh, uh, uh
Here's a little lesson, Lil' Kim don't stress 'em (Yeah, yeah)
Kick 'em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke wit my ex, he with her for now
But little do she know, she's just a rebound (Hey!)
Callin my phone, she's so outta pocket
I been there before ol' girl, you need to stop it
Trickin on me when he tell you he ain't got it
You don't get the picture? My picture's in his wallet (WOO!)
Never ever thought I would leave him alone
But I let a dog roam, now he wanna come home
But I, don't trust him, though I still love him
No longer want him, lookin at his cousin
Kinda buzzin, loose off the Goose
Got him on the chase like cranberry juice
When he's with you, he's wishin it was me (Me)
You might be where he's at, but I'm where he wanna be, baby
Bay-bay
[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
Love you! Hey! Let it go!
Let it go, let it go! (Let it go!)
Aye, Let it go, let it go, let it go (It's where you wanna be)
Let it go, let it go, let it go

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
(If he want you all night) If he ain't gonna treat you the way he should
Then let it go (He ain't comin' home)
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it go

[Post-Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Hands up in the air!

[Interlude: Missy Elliott]
When this song come on in the club, they gon be like
Damn, that's hot (Come on)
And when they play it in the car, they gon' drop they tops like
Damn, that's hot (Whoop!)
They gon' mix it with Biggie, "It was all a dream" like
Damn, that's hot (That's right)
Me, Kim and Keyshia don't stop, 'til the tick don't tock like
Damn, that's hot

[Outro: Missy Elliott]
Yes
Fire, baby!10Embed
