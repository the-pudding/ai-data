6 ContributorsNothin’ at All Lyrics[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
I would walk home every evening
Through the pyramids of light
I would feed myself on silence
Wash it down with empty nights

[Pre-Chorus]
Then your innocent distractions hit me so hard
My emotional reaction caught me off guard

[Chorus]
It was nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
Like anythin' I had felt before
No, nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more
No one else has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it, you just say
It was nothin' at all (Nothin' at all, at all)

[Verse 2]
Now, I walk home every evening
And my feet are quick to move
'Cause I know my destination
Is a warm and waitin' you

From our first communication, it was clear
Any thought of moderation would soon disappear

[Chorus]
It was nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
Like anythin' I had felt before
No, nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more
No one else has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it, you just say
Oh, it was nothin' at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Then your innocent distractions hit me so hard
My emotional reaction caught me off guard

[Chorus]
It was nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
Like anythin' I had felt before
No, nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more
No one else has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it, you just say
Oh, it was nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
Like anythin' I felt before
Oh, nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
Nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
Ooh, ooh, nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
No, nothin' at all…Embed
