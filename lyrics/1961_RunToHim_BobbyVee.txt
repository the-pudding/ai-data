5 ContributorsRun to Him Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you've found another guy who
Satisfies you more than I do
Run to him
I'll step aside

[Verse 2]
If you think his lips can kiss you
Better than my lips can kiss you
Run to him
Forgive my pride

[Chorus]
If someone else's arms can hold you
Better than my arms can hold you
Go to him
And show to him
All your devotion

[Verse 3]
If somebody else can make you
Happier than I can make you
Run to him
My tears will dry

[Chorus]
If someone else's arms can hold you
Better than my arms can hold you
Go to him
And show to him
All your devotion
You might also like[Verse 3]
If somebody else can make you
Happier than I can make you
Run to him
My tears will dry

[Outro]
If you feel you want to love me
I'll be more than glad to love you
Hold you 'til your life is done
But darling, if I'm not the one
Then run to himEmbed
