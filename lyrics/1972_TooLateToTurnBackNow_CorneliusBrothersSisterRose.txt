12 ContributorsToo Late To Turn Back Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
My mama told me
She said, son, please beware
There's this thing called love
And it's everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me, it can break your heart (It can break, break your heart)
And put you in misery (It can put you in misery)
Since I met this little woman
I feel it's happened to me
And I'm telling you

[Chorus]
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

[Verse 2]
I found myself phoning her
At least ten times a day
You know, it's so unusual for me
To carry on this way
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'll tell you, I can't sleep at night (I can't sleep, sleep at night)
Wanting to hold her tight (Just for wanting to hold her tight)
I've tried so hard to convince myself
That this feeling just can't be right
And I'm telling you

[Chorus]
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

It's too late, mm, baby (It's too late to turn back now)
(I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love) Alright
It's too late, baby (To turn back now)
I tell you (I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love) Oh

[Bridge]
I wouldn't mind it
If I knew she really loved me too
But I'd hate to think that I'm in love alone
And nothing that I can do, whoa
[Chorus]
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late, baby (It's too late to turn back now)
I tell you, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
Oh, baby (It's too late to turn back now)
I tell you, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love1Embed
