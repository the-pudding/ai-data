8 ContributorsNever Surrender Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just a little more time is all we're asking for
'Cause just a little more time could open closing doors
Just a little uncertainty can bring you down

[Pre-Chorus]
And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how

[Chorus]
So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender

[Verse 2]
With a little perseverance
You can get things done
Without the blind adherence
That has conquered some

[Pre-Chorus]
And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how
You might also like[Chorus]
So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender

[Chorus]
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
No one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender

[Outro]
Oh, time is all we're asking for
To never surrender
Oh, you can never surrender
Time is all you're asking for
Stand your ground, never surrender
Oh, I said you never surrender, oh1Embed
