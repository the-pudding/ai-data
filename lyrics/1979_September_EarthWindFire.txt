Do you remember
The twenty-first night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Ba-dee-ya
Say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya
Dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya
Never was a cloudy day

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-du, ba-du, ba-du, ba-du
Ba-du, ba-du, ba-du, ba-du
Ba-du, ba-du, ba-du-da
Ba-du, yeah

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December
Found a love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
True love we share today
