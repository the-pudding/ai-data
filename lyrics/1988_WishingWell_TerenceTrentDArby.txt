14 ContributorsWishing Well Lyrics[Verse 1]
Kissing like a bandit, stealing time
Underneath a sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me
Slowly but surely
Your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, sing

[Post-Chorus]
Make it funky now, boys

[Verse 2]
Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler, hahaha
Erotic images float through my head
Say you wanna be a midnight rambler
(I wanna be a midnight rambler)
Quickly, but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring
You might also like[Chorus]
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, get up

[Post-Chorus]
On the beat now, uh
Come on

[Chorus]
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears, come on
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, uh

[Outro]
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Yeah, I feel like goin' on, I feel like goin' on
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Come on, come on
Erotic images float through here
Your midnight rambler, baby, uh
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Yeah, hoo, dig it, follow you anywhere
I don't know, I don't care
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
But all I know is that I gotta be a midnight rambler, baby, uh2Embed
