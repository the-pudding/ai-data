[Chorus]
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best

[Verse 1]
I wasn't looking, but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me, the spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

[Chorus]
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes, I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?

[Verse 2]
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running, but just keep it comin'
How'd you learn to do the things you do?
You might also like[Chorus]
And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, baby, darling, you're the best

[Outro]
Baby, you're the best
Baby, you're the best
(Sweet baby, you're the best)
Darling, you're the best
Darling, you're the best
Sweet baby, you're the best
(Baby, you're the best)
Darling, you're the best...3Embed
