10 ContributorsMidnight Blue Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ain't got no regrets
I ain't losin' track of which way I'm going
I ain't gonna double back, no
Don't want no misplay
Put on no display
An angel? No, but I know my way
Oh yeah, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I used to follow, yeah, that's true
But my following days are over
Now I just gotta follow through
And I remember what my father said
He said, "Son, life is simple"
It's either cherry red

[Chorus]
Or midnight blue
Oh, oh
Midnight blue
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
You were the restless one
And you did not care that
I was the trouble boy lookin' for a double dare
I won't apologize for the things I've done and said
But when I win your heart
I'm gonna paint it cherry red
I don't want to talk about it
What you do to me
I can't live without it
And you might think that it's much too soon
For us to go this far
You might also like[Chorus]
Into the midnight blue
Oh, oh
It's midnight blue
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Now things could be different
That'd be a shame
'Cause I'm the one who can feel the sun
Right in the pouring rain
I won't say where and I don't know when
But soon there gonna come a day, baby
I'll be back again
Yeah, I'll be back for you
Uh-huh
You see, I'm saving up my love

[Outro]
Midnight blue
Oh, oh
Into the midnight blue
Oh, oh
Another midnight blue
Oh, oh
The deepest midnight blue
Oh
It's a midnight blue
Into the midnight blue
Oh, oh
Midnight blue
Oh, oh
Midnight blue
Oh, oh
The deepest midnight blue
Oh, oh
Into the midnight blue
Oh, ohEmbed
