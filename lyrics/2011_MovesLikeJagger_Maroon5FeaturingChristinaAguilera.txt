Oh, na
Oh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
Then aim for my heart if you feel like it
Take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now we're naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
And it goes like this (Uh)
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

Maybe it's hard when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Adam Levine & Christina Aguilera]
And it goes like this (Uh)
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Woo, uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Oh yeah, uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
Uh, you wanna know how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night (Ah)
And if I share my secret, you're gonna have to keep it (Shh)
Nobody else can see this (Ah, uh)
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh, baby, rub me right, yeah
And if I share my secret, you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this, hey, hey, hey, yeah
