26 ContributorsNever Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh) Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh

[Verse 1]
Honestly, if I tell
Tell you what, what you wanna know, love
There ain't another, don't want no other lover
I'll put nothin' above ya, I'll kick 'em to the gutter (Uh-oh)
You try to shake me (Uh-oh)
One look lovin' me crazy now (Uh-oh)
Look at us lately (Uh-oh)
And tell 'em who's your lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs, no in and outs
You're here right now

[Chorus]
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh

[Verse 2]
Now how you're lovin' back
We're happy, it's a fact
Can't nothin' hold us back
We got this in the bag (Uh-oh)
There ain't no maybes (Uh-oh)
No question, love you daily now (Uh-oh)
Look at us lately (Uh-oh)
And tell 'em who's your lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs, no in and outs
You're here right now

[Chorus]
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh2Embed
