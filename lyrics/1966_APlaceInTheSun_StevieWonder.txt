7 ContributorsA Place in the Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like a long lonely stream
I keep running towards a dream
Moving on (Moving on), moving on (Moving on)
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reaching to be free
Moving on (Moving on), moving on (Moving on)

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor, restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

[Verse 2]
Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Moving on (Moving on), moving on (Moving on)
Like this tired, troubled earth
I've been rolling since my birth
Moving on (Moving on), moving on (Moving on)

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor, restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

You know, when times are bad and you're feeling sad (I will find me a place in the sun)
I want you to always remember

[Chorus]
Yes, there's a place in the sun (Place in the sun, place in the sun)
Where there's hope for everyone (Hope for everyone, hope for everyone)
Where my poor, restless heart's gotta run (Poor, restless heart, poor, restless heart, run)
I know there's a place in the sun (Place in the sun, place in the sun)
And before my life is done (Before my life is done, before my life is done)
Gotta find me a place in the sun (Find me a place, find me a place, place in the sun, place in the sun)

Woah, mmm (Place in the sun, place in the sun)
Mmm, mmm, yeah (Place in the sun, place in the sun)2Embed
