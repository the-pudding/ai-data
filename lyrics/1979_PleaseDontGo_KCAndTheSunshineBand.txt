15 ContributorsPlease Donâ€™t Go Lyrics[Intro]
I love you
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Babe, I love you so
I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

[Chorus]
So please don't go, don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go, don't go
I'm begging you to stay

[Verse 2]
If you leave, at least in my lifetime
I've had one dream come true
I was blessed to be loved
By someone as wonderful as you

[Chorus]
So please don't go, don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go, don't go
I'm begging you to stay, hey, hey, hey
