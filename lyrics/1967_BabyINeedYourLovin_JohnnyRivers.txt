5 ContributorsBaby I Need Your Lovinâ€™ Lyrics[Intro]
Oh oh oh ohh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day, another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely

[Chorus]
Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

[Verse 2]
Some say, it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

[Verse 3]
Empty nights
I call your name
Sometimes I wonder, girl
Will I ever be the same?

[Bridge]
When you see me smile
You know
Things are just gettin' worse
Any smile you might see, baby
Has all been rehearsed

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't go on without you
This loneliness won't let me live without you
This emptiness inside me, baby
Makes me feel half alive

[Chorus]
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
[Outro]
Oh, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
You know I need your lovin'Embed
