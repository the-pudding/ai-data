58 ContributorsThong Song Lyrics[Intro]
This thing right here
Is lettin' all the ladies know
What guys talk about
You know
The finer things in life
Hahaha
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Ooh, that dress so scandalous
And you know another nigga couldn't handle it
See you shaking that thing like, "Who's the ish?"
With a look in your eye so devilish, ugh
You like to dance at all the hip-hop spots
And you cruise to the crews like connect-the-dots
Not just urban, she like the pop (Ugh)
'Cause she was livin' la vida loca

[Pre-Chorus]
She had dumps (Ugh) like a truck (Ugh), truck (Ugh), truck (Ugh)
Thighs (Ugh) like what (Ugh), what (Ugh), what (Ugh)
Baby, move your butt (Ugh), butt (Ugh), butt (Ugh)

She had dumps like a truck (Ugh), truck (Ugh), truck (Ugh)
Thighs like what (Ugh), what (Ugh), what (Ugh)
All night long (Hahaha)
