Yo, who dat off-brand nigga tryna hang with the clique?
Flossin' like you came with the clique, but would you bang with the clique if it was thick?
Or do you just ride dick?
'Cause playa, I don't know you, nigga, tell me who you with
If you ain't with the squad, you bound to get scarred
Sucker boys run they mouth, real niggas run the yard
'Round here we blow trees, don't fuck with OB's
You dick ridin' niggas might be the police, aight

Me and my girls rollin' deep, represent the Zoe
Bunch of fly-ass bitches, when we ride, it's on
See them niggas all pause, droppin' digital phones
Askin' me, "Where you from?" 'cause they wantin' to clone, niggas
Them lines they spit, they want my shit
But game be wack, I turn my back
Then I hear that you're lickin, stickin' it, tellin' all your friends that your dick in it
When you know you'll never get with this Hi-Fi shit, nigga, you was sick with this, say
"Who dat? Who dat?" (Ay, yai, yai,) No chance, blew dat
When you said that you rolled with this had red zone niggas throwin' blows for this bitch
Don't you deny it, nigga, don't even try it, nigga
You makin' claims that you laid with the fire, nigga
Don't know your name, it still remains
That you would say you fucked Solé
Every time that I turn my back, burn the track, niggas wanna say that they earned a stack
Dick to jack, picture that, say my name and then wonder, "Who the fuck is that?" Why?

[Chorus: JT Money]
Ay, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai
Ay, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai
Who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who?
Who dat, who dat, who dat tryna get up in my crew?
Ay, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai
Ay, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai
Who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who?
Who dat, who dat, who dat tryna get up in my crew?
[Verse 3: JT Money]
I'm considered legendary up in this motherfucker
Veteran in this game and still bringin' ruckus
Never had no time for tricks or no bustas
I only fuck with dat real, I got no love for suckas
All these tiny-ass niggas be wantin' to wear my shoes
Ain't got the slightest of clues or either paid your dues
Then these hoes goin' crazy 'bout J, baby
The way you show me your love is by the way you pay me
The game room been closed, so stay up out of mine
Just know I keep niggas up and crunk like powder lines
Motherfuckers be all up in a nigga biz
Tryin' to question my shit just like a pop quiz, nigga what this is? Aight

[Chorus: JT Money]
Ay, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai
Ay, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai
Who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who?
Who dat, who dat, who dat tryna get up in my crew?
Ay, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai
Ay, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai
Who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who dat, who?
Who dat, who dat, who dat tryna get up in my crew?

[Post-Chorus: JT Money]
We off the chain, nigga, we runnin' game, nigga
You wanna bang, nigga? It ain't no thang, nigga
We off the chain, nigga, we runnin' game, nigga
You wanna bang, nigga? It ain't no thang, nigga, aight
