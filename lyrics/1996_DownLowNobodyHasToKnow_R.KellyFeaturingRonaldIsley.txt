14 ContributorsDown Low (Nobody Has to Know) Lyrics[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Listen, girl, you want me but he needs you
Yet you're telling me that everything is cool
Trying to convince me, baby, to do as you say
Just go along and see things your way

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]
And keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Secret lovers is what you wanna be
While making love to him, girl, you're silently calling on me
What is a man to do in a situation like this?
I feel there is something that I, I don't wanna miss

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]
And keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Coming by my way driving his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together

And keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

[Outro: R. Kelly & Ron Isley]
Listen, babe, I won't whisper a word
How could you go, so low, so low
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Keep it on the down low2Embed
