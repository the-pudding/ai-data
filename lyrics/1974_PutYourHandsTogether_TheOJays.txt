7 ContributorsPut Your Hands Together Lyrics[Intro]
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah (Hey, yeah)
Ooh, yeah
Huh, huh, huh
Come on, come on, come on, y'all now
Put your hands together, na-na-na-na
Put your hands together, everybody now
Put your hands together, na-na-na-na
And let us pray

[Verse 1]
We got to pray for all the brothers under thine hand
Pray for all the sisters that's doing the best she can
Let us pray that tomorrow, there'll be a better day to come, yeah
We got to put our voices together
Sing a song so loud, so clear
That the birds in the trees hum along with the
Sweet harmony

[Refrain]
Well, let it thunder, let it lightning
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
'Cause we're gonna sing, "glory, hallelujah"
So the whole wide world can hear (Come on, come on, y'all, now)

[Chorus]
Put your hands together
Hey, happy too, y'all (Come on now)
Put your hands together
The Lord, he got us through (Huh, huh, come on)
Put your hands together
Na, na, na, na
And let us pray
