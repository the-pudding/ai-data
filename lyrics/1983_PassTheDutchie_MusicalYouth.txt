This generation
Rules di nation
With version
Music happen to be the food of love
Sounds to really make you rub an' scrub
*Scatting* (I say)

[Chorus]
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side (I say)
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side
It are go bun, give me di music, make mi jump an' prance
It are go dun, give mi di music, make mi rockin' at di dance
Jah know!

[Verse 1]
It was a cool an' lonely breezy afternoon
How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
How does it feel when you've got no food?
So I left my gate an' went out for a walk
How does it feel when you've got no food?
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say
How does it feel when you've got no food?

[Chorus]
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side (I say)
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side
It are go bun, give me di music, make mi jump an' prance
It are go dun, give mi di music, make mi rockin' at di dance
Jah know! *Scatting*

So I stopped to find out what was going on
How does it feel when you've got no food?
'Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on
How does it feel when you've got no food?
There was a ring of dreads an' a session was there in swing
How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel the chill as I seen an' heard them say
How does it feel when you've got no food?

[Chorus]
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side (I say)
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side
It are go bun, give me di music, make mi jump an' prance
It are go dun, give mi di music, make mi rockin' at di dance
Jah know!

[Verse 3]
Now mi say listen to di drum, an' mi say listen to di bass
Give mi likkle music, make mi wind up mi waist
Mi say, listen to di drum, an' mi say listen to di bass
Give mi likkle music, make mi wind up mi waist (I say)

[Chorus]
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side (I say)
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side
It are go bun, give me di music, make mi jump an' prance
It are go dun, give mi di music, make mi rockin' at di dance
Jah know!
[Bridge]
You play it on the radio
An' so mi say, we are go hear it on the stereo
An' so mi know, we are go play it on the disco
An' so mi say, we are go hear it on the stereo (Bow)

[Chorus]
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side (I say)
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side
It are go bun, give me di music, make mi jump an' prance
It are go dun, give mi di music, make mi rockin' at di dance
Jah know!

[Outro]
Cah mi say, say east, say west, say north an' south
