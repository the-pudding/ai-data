38 ContributorsMiss You Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, hey
Yeah-yeah-yeah
No-no-no-no-no-no

[Chorus]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I've been needing you (Said I'm needing you), wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

[Verse 1]
Off to college, yes, you went away
Straight from high school, you up and left me
We were close friends, also lovers
Did everything for one another
Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back to me, can you feel me calling?
Hear me calling for you, for you, 'cause it's

[Chorus]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I've been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes (I miss you)

Now I'm sitting here, thinking 'bout you
And the days we used to share
It's driving me crazy, I don't know what to do
I'm just wondering if you still care
I don't wanna let you know that it's killing me
I know you got another life you gotta concentrate, baby
Come back to me, can you feel me calling?
Hear me calling for you, for you, 'cause it's

[Chorus]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
I've been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes, yeah
I miss you

[Bridge]
I-I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-I-I (I miss you)
I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-I
I can't be no more, no
Since you went away, I don't really feel like talking (No)
No one here to love me (No), baby, do you understand me?
I can't do a thing without you
[Chorus]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
Tell what I'm gonna do?
Said I've been needing you (Yeah), wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes (Yeah)
I miss you (Baby)
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I've been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I've been needing you, wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you26Embed
