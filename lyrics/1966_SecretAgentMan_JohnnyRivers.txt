There's a man who leads a life of danger
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger
With every move he makes
Another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

[Chorus]
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

[Verse 2]
Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Ah, be careful what you say
Or you'll give yourself away
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

[Chorus]
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

[Chorus]
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given you a number
And taken away your name
You might also like[Verse 3]
Swingin' on the Riviera one day
And then layin' in the Bombay alley next day
Oh no, you let the wrong word slip
While kissing persuasive lips
The odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

[Chorus]
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given you a number
And taken away your name

[Outro]
