Hmm, mmmh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Brian with Howie]
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man
That I've become, oh yeah

[Chorus: All]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Verse 2: AJ with Kevin & Howie]
Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
You might also like[Bridge: Nick]
I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus: All, Brian, (AJ) & Nick]
I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (heart!)
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
(Now let me show you the true shape of my heart!)
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of...

[Outro: AJ]
Show you the shape of my heart7Embed
