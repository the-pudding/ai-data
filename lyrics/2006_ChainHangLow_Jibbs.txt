31 ContributorsChain Hang Low Lyrics[Intro]
Beatstaz!
[Chorus]
Do your chain hang low? Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light? Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you thow it over your shoulder? If ya hot, it'd make ya cold? (Oh)
Do your chain (Oh) hang (Oh) low?

[Refrain]
Is that ya chain?
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain, you can tell the big kid do his thang
You know the name
Is that ya chain?
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain, you can tell the big kid do his thang
I'm off the chain

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm hot, kid
Chain so low, you would think the diamonds never stopped it
And it's funny 'cause you could never stop it
A bunch of rocks on my hand and I ain't even on the block, kid
Show 'em white gold, sorta hold it like my Timbs
And the chain hang twenty-four inches like the rims
Diamonds all blown up (Yeah), sorta like a pimp
So when the light hit the ice, it starts glistenin' off the tip (Glistenin' off the tip)
My chain hang, all it do is bling-bling
Half blue, half red, like my diamonds gang-bang
And I don't even think we on the same thang
Charm so heavy, they couldn't lift it 'til the crane came (Yeah)
You might also like[Chorus]
Do your chain hang low? Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light? Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over your shoulder? If ya hot, it'd make ya cold?
Do your chain hang low?
Do your chain hang low? Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light? Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over your shoulder? If ya hot, it'd make ya cold?
Do your chain hang low?

[Verse 2]
(Chain) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so icy (Do your chain—)
My charm so heavy that my neck don't like me (Do your chain—)
Gone and no, no, no, its not a game, kid (Do your chain—)
'Cause I'll throw my chain in the crowd like Game did (Do your chain—, this is nothin')
Diamonds is nothin' to me (Do it shine—)
Especially when I'm dressin' up, it's just a button to me (Bling)
(Could you through it over your shoulder?) And not to mention my tees
'Cause they color coordinated, complimentin' the teeth (Alright, thanks)
So check out my swag
The diamonds red, white and blue like the American flag (Do it shine—, the boy is so colorful)
And see I got that nice cream
My money I spent on jewels, I call it my ice cream (Ch-ch-chain)
Give you a black eye 'cause of the beating
They think I am a mutant, the way your boy is beasting (Ch-ch-chain)
I stay winnin' some time, you will call it cheating
Yeah, my boys always around (Oh) like it's a meeting
[Refrain]
Is that ya chain? (Do your chain—)
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang (Do your chain—)
Hop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range (Do your chain—)
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang (Do your chain—)
You know the name
Is that ya chain? (Do your chain—)
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang (Do your chain—)
Hop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range (Do your chain—)
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang (Do your chain—)
I'm off the chain

[Chorus]
Do your chain hang low? Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light? Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over your shoulder? If ya hot, it'd make ya cold?
Do your chain hang low?
Do your chain hang low? Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light? Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over your shoulder? If ya hot, it'd make ya cold?
Do your chain hang low?10Embed
