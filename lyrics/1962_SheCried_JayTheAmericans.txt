5 ContributorsShe Cried Lyrics[Verse 1]
And when I told her
I didn't love her anymore
She cried (she cried)

[Verse 2]
And when I told her
Her kisses were not like before
She cried (she cried)

[Bridge]
I thought that our romance was over and done
But to her it had just begun

[Verse 3]
And when I told her
Another girl had caught my eye
She cried (she cried)

[Verse 4]
And when I kissed her
A kiss that only meant goodbye
She cried (she cried), she cried

[Instrumental Break]

And when I told her
I didn't love her anymore
She cried (she cried)Embed
