23 ContributorsAmos Moses LyricsYeah, here comes Amos

[Verse 1]
Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by his self in the swamp
He hunted alligator for livin'
He just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get you Amos!
It ain't legal huntin' alligator down in the swamp boy!

[Verse 2]
Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana Bayou

[Chorus]
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left cuz alligator bit it!
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow!

[Verse 4]
Well the Sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp tracking alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to?
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana Bayou!

[Chorus]
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well, they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth,
Called him Amos Moses

[Outro]
Set out on 'em Amos
Make it count, Son!
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana5Embed
