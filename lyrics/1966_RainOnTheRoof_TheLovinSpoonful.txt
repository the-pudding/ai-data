3 ContributorsRain on the Roof Lyrics[Verse 1]
You and me and rain on the roof
Caught up in a summer shower
Dryin' while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours
Waitin' out the sun

[Verse 2]
You and me, we're gabbin' away
Dreamy conversation, sittin' in the hay
Honey, how long was I laughin' in the rain with you?
'Cause I didn't feel a drop
Ttil the thunder brought us to

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
You and me underneath a roof of tin
Pretty comfy feelin', how the rain ain't leakin' in
We can sit and dry just as long as it can pour
'Cause the way it makes you look
Makes me hope it rains some more

[Interlude]

[Verse 1]
You and me and rain on the roof
Caught up in a summer shower
Dryin' while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours
Waitin' out the sunYou might also likeEmbed
