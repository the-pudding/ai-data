38 ContributorsDonâ€™t Think Jesus Lyrics[Verse 1]
Boy gets a guitar and starts writin' songs
'Bout whiskey and women and gettin' too stoned
He got all three at the first show he played
Hometown said, "I don't think Jesus done it that way"

[Verse 2]
Boy moves to city, lives fast and goes hard
Starts chasin' the devil through honky-tonk bars
Ignorin' the voices in his head that say
"I don't think Jesus done it this way"

[Chorus]
If I was Him I'd say, "To hell with you, ain't no helpin' you"
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm tellin' you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me, I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

[Verse 3]
Boy's all alone, got no one to turn to
He figures he'll pray, 'cause what else could he do?
He said, "I wish You would've woke me up an easier way"
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

[Chorus]
If I was Him I'd say, "To hell with you, ain't no helpin' you"
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm tellin' you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me, I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

World likes to rear back and throw a few stones
So boy wants to throw a few stones of his own
But, Lord knows, I ain't perfect and it ain't my place
And I don't think Jesus done it that way

[Outro]
Are y'all sure that Jesus done it that way?4Embed
