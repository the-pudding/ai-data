1 ContributorThink Lyrics[Intro: Big Rube]
Material obsessions, with inferior possessions
That are merely to dress in for what lies beneath should cease

A foundation of substance is what holds true value
So be insistent in the mission of seeding new souls with true values

Stay persistent, molding minds to full potential is never instant
The mental like the muscles increasing powers incremental

Living free not dying trapped is the hustle we should be into
In life if we lucky knowledge gained becomes wisdom

So don't be afraid to make some mistakes cause we're meant to
Grow

[Verse 1: 2Ru3]
Why do we idolize those with diamonds and gold
Why do we mistreat our women and then label them hoes

Why must so many dig in trash bags for a meal
Why are we slow to show some love but quick to brandish steel

Have we not learned from mistakes of old times past
You can't escape harsh realities through a wine glass
You might also likeThe solution is unity in our communities
Seeing each other as people and equal human beings

Our children need us to proceed with love and dignity
Cause if we don't, they'll grow to live cold and wickedly

Remember me, as the one who tried to lend a hand
Of knowledge wisdom and understanding to my fellow man

Please Lord, let me reach many instead of one
So the message can carry on in hopes we build on love

Father forgive me for any wrongdoings I may have done
Let it be known eternally I'm one of your sons

[Chorus: Big Rube]
The shine of a strong mind, who widens in sight and never blinds
The guiding light reveals a higher path
But it's up to you to choose to climb

Wise use of time and space
Protects the youthful mind from wasting away
Emerging is a useful mind with the tools to face
Perhaps even save the day, we all should bring this task to bear

[Verse 2: 2Ru3]
Why so many of us locked up in a jail cell
Not only physically but spiritually living in hell
Can we excel, and stop idolizing a life of crime
Father come home, mother please ease your child's mind

I ain't saying that it's easy, but we gotta try
If black don't ever value black then it's all a lie, come on

Don't get me twisted, please understand this
I know that things done unto us were wicked and scandalous

But man listen, at a point in time we gotta draw the line
Fight and work to reverse the effects of systemic divide
You down to ride

Recognize the power lies inside
Of people unifying by way of heart, soul and mind
That's right

Life is precious to be cherished, never wasted
Don't bust that Glock or pop them pills live you can be greater

Heavy trodden is the path of criminal behavior
Laden with tears, bloodshed and early graves, bruh

[Chorus: Big Rube]
Life is a gift, a precious treasure
But doesn't come so neatly wrapped
It can't be exchanged just cause it fits a lil strange
And if you unsatisfied you can't bring it back

No returns or coupons for free service next time
We must press forward through trials and tests

Sadness and pain are needed for reference
The true quest for happiness demands no less

[Verse 3: 2Ru3]
How can it be so easy to decease and die
Yet so much pain to maintain and birth new life

If truth exists, then tell me why so many opinions
If right is right and wrong is wrong, how are the righteous wicked
Do you hear me

If you figured the game then why play dumb
Filling your stomach knowing how to cease your brothers hunger

I sit and wonder how many can call themselves a friend
But be the first to wanna murder when his partner win

I comprehend better days gotta come homie
But ain't no way we gonna make it without love homie

Putting to death foolish divisions no more living blind
Foney imagery put asunder as real souljas rise

Value of money must be put into proper position
Never worth the demise of innocent men, women and children

These words written with sincere loving and intention
To provoke thoughts share jewels and wake rested spirits

[Outro: Big Rube]
Life can offer so many a blessing
Each experience unique and diverse

The people we meet, the places we go
Things we do for better or worse

Gives us perspective, layers and facets
Though sometimes this blessing may feel like a curse

With each obstacle conquered, each smile that we wear
With each person we love, it shows it's true worth

Joy and laughter brought on by new birth
Can change in an instant, death brings us much hurt

No one sided coins, existence is balance
All things are connected in this universe

Everything we deem good is tethered to bad
With no threat of doom, no hope could be had

To create something, something else must be destroyed
Without this system, all existence is void
