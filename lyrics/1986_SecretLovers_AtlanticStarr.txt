Here we are
The two of us together
Taking this crazy chance
To be all alone

We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if we're found out
It could mess up both our happy homes

[Verse 2: David Lewis]
I hate to think about us
All meeting up together
'Cause soon as I looked at you
It would show on my face
Then they'll know that
We've been loving each other
They can never know
No, no, no
We can't leave a trace

[Chorus]
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
We shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go, no no
'Cause we love each other so

Sitting at home
I do nothing all day
But think about you
And hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call
Before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously
Alone by the phone

[Verse 4: David Lewis]
How could something so wrong
Be so right?
I wish we didn't have to
Keep our love out of sight, yeah
Living two lives
Just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on in there
Or fall

[Chorus]
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
Because we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real
So real, so real
[Bridge]
You and me
Are we fair?
Is this cruel
Or do we care?
Can they tell
What's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret lovers
All of the time

[Verse 5: David Lewis & Barbara Weathers]
In the middle of making love
We notice the time
We both get nervous
'Cause it's way after 9:00
Even though we hate it
We know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful
So that no one will know

[Chorus Outro]
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
We shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real
So real, so real
So real, so realEmbed
