25 ContributorsVacation Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can't seem to get my mind off of you
Back here at home, there's nothin' to do, ooh
Now that I'm away, I wish I'd stayed
Tomorrow's a day of mine that you won't be in

[Verse 2]
When you looked at me, I should have run
But I thought it was just for fun
I see I was wrong, and I'm not so strong
I should have known all along that time would tell

[Pre-Chorus]
A week without you
Thought I'd forget
Two weeks without you and I
Still haven't gotten over you yet

[Chorus]
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone

[Pre-Chorus]
A week without you
Thought I'd forget
Two weeks without you and I
Still haven't gotten over you yet

[Chorus]
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone

[Outro]
Vacation, all I ever wanted
Vacation, had to get away
Vacation, meant to be spent alone5Embed
