8 ContributorsMama Canâ€™t Buy You Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, so they give you anythin'
Darlin', all the joy money can bring
Baby, do they bring you happiness
Darlin', you're no different from the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you see that it's love you really need
Take my hand, and I'll show what a love could be
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Verse 2]
Baby, fancy friends show you a smile
Darlin', rich relations for a while
Baby, I can only give you love
Darlin', a-this old heart should be enough

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is a chance to make you mine
Let me in, oh, I'll change the way you feel inside
Before it's too late
You might also like[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love1Embed
