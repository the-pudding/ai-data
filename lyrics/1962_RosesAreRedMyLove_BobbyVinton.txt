10 ContributorsRoses Are Red (My Love) Lyrics[Intro]
Roses are red, my love!
Du-du-du-du

[Verse 1]
A long-long time ago
On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way

[Chorus]
Roses are red, my love!
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love!
But not as sweet as you

[Verse 2]
We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name

[Chorus]
Roses are red, my love!
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love!
But not as sweet as you
As sweet as you
You might also like[Verse 3]
Then, I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter, dear!
And I wrote back to you

[Refrain]
Roses are red, my love!
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
Good luck! May God bless you
May God bless you

[Verse 4]
Is that your little girl?
She looks a lot like you
Someday, some boy will write
In her book, too

[Chorus]
Roses are red, my love!
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love!
But not as sweet as you

[Outro]
Roses are red1Embed
