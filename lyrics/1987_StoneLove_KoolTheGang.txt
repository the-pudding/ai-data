4 ContributorsStone Love LyricsGirl, the first time we met
You took me by surprise
Oooh, girl, you walked into my life
With those street corner blues
You were living in the fast lane
Much to my surprise, baby
But I fell for you anyway
I'm addicted to your love, girl
Hey

Stone love
Solid as a rock
I'm in love with you, baby
Stone love
Oooh, oooh, oooh, solid as a rock

Girl, our love is so unique
It's one of a kind
And girl, whenever we kiss
It's like a natural high
But we're living in the fast lane
Red lights flashing, baby
Will we ever change the way we are?
Stone love, girl
