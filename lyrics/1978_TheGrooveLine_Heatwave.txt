8 ContributorsThe Groove Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pack your grip
Takin' you on a trip
Ain't no seats
All we got's dancin' feet

[Chorus]
Leave your worries behind
'Cause rain, shine
Won't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight

[Verse 2]
Get this train
Know you'll be glad you came
Hit the track
Party hard there and back

[Chorus]
Leave your worries behind (Leave your worries behind)
'Cause rain, shine
Won't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight

[Bridge]
Check out, the wheels are turnin'
You know we won't stop
We got this boiler burnin'
We're keepin' it hot

Get the train comin' through
Climb on board
Where you leave's up to you

[Chorus]
Leave your worries behind (Leave your worries behind)

We're ridin' on the groove line tonight

Leave you worries behind (Leave your worries behind)
'Cause rain, shine

Check out the wheels are turnin'
You know we won't stop
