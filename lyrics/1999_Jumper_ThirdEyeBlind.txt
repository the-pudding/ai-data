I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand, I would understand

[Verse 1: Stephan Jenkins]
The angry boy, a bit too insane
Icing over a secret pain
You know you don't belong
You're the first to fight, you're way too loud
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud
I know something's wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
Well, everyone I know has got a reason
To say, "Put the past away"

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand, I would understand

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
Well he's on the table and he's gone to code
And I do not think anyone knows
What they are doing here
And your friends have left you, you've been dismissed
I never thought it would come to this
And I, I want you to know

Maybe today, you could put the past away

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand, I would understand
I would understand

[Refrain: Third Eye Blind]
I would understand
I would understand
I would understand

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Stephan Jenkins]
Can you put the past away?
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
And I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
And I would understand25Embed
