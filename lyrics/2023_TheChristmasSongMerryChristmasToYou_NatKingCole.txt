6 ContributorsThe Christmas Song (Merry Christmas to You) Lyrics[Verse]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways, merry Christmas to you

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways, merry Christmas to youYou might also likeEmbed
