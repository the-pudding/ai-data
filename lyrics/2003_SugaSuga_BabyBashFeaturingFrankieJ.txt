46 ContributorsSuga Suga Lyrics[Intro: Frankie J, Baby Bash]
(So) So tight, so fly (Mm)
You got me lifted
You got me lifted

[Chorus: Frankie J]
You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

[Post-Chorus: Baby Bash]
You know it's leather when we ride
Woodgrain and rawhide (Rawhide)
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high (High)
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns (Buns)
You was there when the money was gone (Gone)
You'll be there when the money comes (Comes)

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Off top, I can't lie, I love to get blowed (Blowed)
You my little sugar, I'm your little chulo (Chulo)
And every time we kick it (Uh)
It's off to the groovy (Groove)
Treat you like my sticky icky
Or my sweet ooh-wee, gooey (Yeah, for real, though)
You might also like[Chorus: Frankie J]
You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Now, I ain't worried about a thang 'cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a superfly chick
And uh-uh, and there ain't nothin' you can say to a player
'Cause doo-wop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right, she full-grown, settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly like a dove, fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Bravada
Rockin' Dolce Gabbana, hydro in a Cubana

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
[Post-Chorus: Baby Bash]
You know it's leather when we ride
Woodgrain and rawhide
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
You know it's leather when we ride
Woodgrain and rawhide
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
For real, though

[Chorus: Frankie J]
You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

[Outro: Baby Bash]
So high like I'm a star
So high like I'm a star
So high like I'm a star
So high like I'm a star
