50 ContributorsLovers and Friends Lyrics[Intro: Usher & Lil Jon]
Usher, Usher
Lil Jon, Ludacris
Yeah, man
Once again, it's on
It's on
You know we had to do it again, right?
We had to do it again, boy (Uh-huh, uh, yeah)
I want you to sing to these ladies, man
Oh, oh, oh (I guess I'm up first, let me at 'em)
Oh, oh, oh (Check it, let's get it)

[Verse 1: Usher]
Baby, how you doing? Hope that you're fine
Wanna know what you got in mind tonight
Got me fiendin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone (Got me fiending)
Take a shot of this here Patr√≥n and it's gon' be on
VIP done got way too crowded, I'm about to end up calling it a night
You should holler at your girl, tell her you're shaking the scene
Pull off, beep, beep, shotgun in the GT with me
She said, "Oh, I'm ready to ride"
I was like, "Yeah, 'cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind
Don't mean to sound impatient, but you gotta promise, baby"
Oh

[Chorus: Usher & Ludacris]
Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Oh, I gotta know baby, oh, yeah)
Tell me again (Make sure you're right, oh, before we begin)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Oh, oh, it's a good look baby)
It's a really good look, baby, look here
You might also like[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Sometime wanna be your lover, sometime wanna be your friend
Sometime wanna hug you, hold hands, slow dance while the record spins
Opened up your heart 'cause you said I made you feel so comfortable
Used to play back then, now you all grown up like Rudy Huxtable
I could be your Bud, you could beat me up
Play fight in the dark, then we both make up
I'd do anything just to feel your butt
Why you got me so messed up?
I don't know, but you gotta stop tripping
Be a good girl, now turn around and get these whippings
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back
Here's a pillow, bite that
And I'll be setting separate plays
So on all these separate days
Your legs can go they separate ways

[Chorus: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Oh, it's a good look, baby)
Tell me again (Tell me over and over and over again)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Make sure you're right before you choose)

[Verse 3: Lil' Jon]
I've been knowing you for a long time (Shorty)
But fucking never crossed my mind (Shorty)
But tonight, I seen something in you (Shorty)
That made me wanna get with you (Shorty)
You ain't been nothing but a friend to me (Shorty)
And a nigga never, ever dreamed we'd be (Shorty)
Up in here kissing, hugging, squeezing, touching (Shorty)
Up in the bathtub rub-a-dubbing (Shorty)
Are you sure you wanna go this route? (Shorty)
Let a nigga know before I pull it out (Shorty)
I would never, ever cross the line (Shorty)
Shorty, let me hear you tell me one more time
One more time
[Chorus: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Oh, it's a good look, baby)
Tell me again (Make sure you're right, oh, before we leave)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Tell me over and over and over again)
