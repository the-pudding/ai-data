12 ContributorsThis Time I Know Itâ€™s for Real Lyrics[Verse 1]
What would I have to do
To get you to notice me too?
Do I stand in line?
One of a million admiring eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky

[Chorus]
I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, baby
When I get my hands on you, I won't let go
This time I know it's for real

[Verse 2]
Should I write or call your home?
Shout it out with a megaphone?
Radio, TV news
Got to find a way to get the message to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Say I love you with a neon sign
Anything to make you mine
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you, I might explode, oh baby
I've been around the block enough to know
This time I know it's for real

[Bridge]
Ooo, baby
This time, this time
This time, this time
Oh, baby
This time, this time
Oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky

[Chorus]
I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, baby
When I get my hands on you, I won't let go
This time I know it's for real
I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you, I might explode, oh baby
I've been around the block enough to know
This time I know it's for realEmbed
