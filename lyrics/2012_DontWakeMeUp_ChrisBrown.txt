55 ContributorsDonâ€™t Wake Me Up Lyrics[Intro: Priscilla Renea]
Dearly beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams
Don't wake me up

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Too much light in this window, don't wake me up
Only coffee, no sugar inside my cup
If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss
I wasn't finished dreamin' about your lips

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't wake me up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, yeah
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
So much life in the city, you won't believe
Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed
Tell me what is the music inside my head
