17 ContributorsKeeps Gettinâ€™ Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
Step back, gonna come at you fast
I'm drivin' outta control and gettin' ready to crash
Won't stop shakin' up what I can
I serve it up in a shot so suck it down like a man

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So baby, yes, I know what I am
And no, I don't give a damn
And you'll be lovin' it, ah

[Chorus]
Some days I'm a super bitch
Up to my old tricks
But it won't last forever
Next day, I'm your super girl
Out to save the world
And it keeps gettin' better

[Verse 2]
Kiss kiss, gonna tell you right now
I'll make it sweet on the lips, I'll simply knock you out
Shut up, I don't care what you say
'Cause when we're both in the ring, you're gonna like it my way

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yeah baby, there's a villain in me
So sexy, sour and sweet
And you'll be lovin' it, ah

Some days I'm a super bitch (Super bitch)
Up to my old tricks
But it won't last forever (It won't last forever, no)
Next day, I'm your super girl (Super girl)
Out to save the world
And it keeps gettin' better

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on
It keeps gettin' better
Hold on
It keeps gettin' better

[Bridge]
In the blink of an eye, in the speed of the light
I hold the universe up while making planets collide
When I strap on my boots and I slip on my suit
You see, the vixen in me becomes an angel for you

[Chorus]
Some days I'm a super bitch (Super bitch)
Up to my old tricks
But it won't last forever (It won't last forever, no)
Next day, I'm your super girl (Super girl)
Out to save the world
And it keeps gettin' better
Some days I'm a super bitch (A super bitch)
Up to my old tricks
But it won't last forever (No, no)
Next day, I'm your super girl (Your super girl)
Out to save the world
And it keeps gettin' better
[Outro]
Hold on
It keeps gettin' better
Hold on
It keeps gettin' better1Embed
