Sunshine
On my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes
Can make me cry
Sunshine on the water
Looks so lovely
Sunshine
Almost always makes me high

[Verse 1]
If I had a day
That I could give you
I'd give to you
The day just like today
If I had a song
That I could sing for you
I'd sing a song
To make you feel this way

[Chorus]
Sunshine
On my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes
Can make me cry
Sunshine on the water
Looks so lovely
Sunshine
Almost always makes me high
You might also like[Verse 2]
If I had a tale
That I could tell you
I'd tell a tale
Sure to make you smile
If I had a wish
That I could wish for you
I'd make a wish
For sunshine for all the while

[Chorus]
Sunshine
On my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes
Can make me cry
Sunshine on the water
Looks so lovely
Sunshine
Almost always makes me high

[Outro]
Sunshine
Almost all the time makes me high
Sunshine
Almost always....4Embed
