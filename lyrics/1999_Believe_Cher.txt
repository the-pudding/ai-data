After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love

[Verse 1]
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"

What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back

[Pre-Chorus]
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"

[Bridge]
Well, I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
And I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore
[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"
Do you believe in life after love?33Embed
