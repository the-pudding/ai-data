Ow!

[Chorus]
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
You gotta have something if you wanna be with me
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
You gotta have something if you wanna be with me

[Verse 1]
I'm not trying to be your hero
'Cause that zero is too cold for me
I'm not trying to be your highness
'Cause that minus is too low to see, yeah
Ah, ah
Hey

[Verse 2]
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
And I'm not stuffing, believe you me
Don't you remember I told ya
I'm a soldier in the war on poverty
Yeah, yes, I am

[Chorus]
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
You gotta have something if you wanna be with me, oh baby
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
You gotta have something if you wanna be with me
That's right, ha, yeah

Gotta have something if you wanna be with me
You gotta bring me something, girl, if you wanna be with me6Embed
