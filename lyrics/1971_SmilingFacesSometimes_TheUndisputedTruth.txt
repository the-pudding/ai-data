13 ContributorsSmiling Faces Sometimes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Smiling faces sometimes
Pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces
Of the evil that lurks within (Can you dig it?)

[Chorus]
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies
And I got proof
Oh lawd, yeah

[Verse 2]
Let me tell ya
The truth is in the eyes
'Cause the eyes don't lie, amen
Remember, a smile is just a frown
Turned upside down, my friend
So hear me when I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
Hey, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies
And I got proof
You might also like[Verse 3]
(Beware) Beware of the handshake
That hides a snake (Can you dig it, can you dig it?)
I'm telling you (Beware)
Beware of the pat on the back
It just might hold you back
Jealousy (Jealousy)
Misery (Misery)
Envy (Envy)
I tell you, you can't see behind

[Chorus]
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
Hey, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies
And I got proof

[Verse 4]
Hey, your enemy won't do you no harm (Rap on)
'Cause you'll know where he's coming from
Don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya
Take my advice, I'm only tryin' to school ya

[Chorus]
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies
And I got proof
(Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes)3Embed
