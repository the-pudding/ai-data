My baby, she may not a-look
Like one of those bunnies out of a Playboy Club
But she got somethin' much greater than gold
Crazy 'bout that girl, how she got so much soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, she got the kind of lovin'
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow
Glad that I'm her fella, and I know

[Chorus]
That she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do, hey!

[Verse 2]
My baby, when she walks by
All the fellows go, "Mmm," and I know why
It's simply 'cause that girl, she looks so fine
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
She got the kind of lovin'
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow
Glad that I'm her fella, and I know
You might also like[Chorus]
That she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me
'Cause she knocks me off my feet, hey
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do, hey!

[Verse 3]
Everybody in the neighborhood
Will testify that my girl, she looks so good
Yeah, she's so fine, she'd give eyesight to the blind
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
She got the kind of lovin'
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow
Glad that I'm her fella, and I know

[Chorus]
That she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
[Outro]
Baby, yeah
You got that, got that soulful feel
Yeah, it's all right
Mercy, mercy, mercyEmbed
