40 ContributorsParalyzer Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

[Verse 2]
I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me

Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you
Not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

[Outro]
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you24Embed
