48 ContributorsToo Close Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know I'm not one to break promises
I don't want to hurt you, but I need to breathe
At the end of it all, you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release

[Pre-Chorus]
Which way is right?
Which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're heading separate ways

[Chorus]
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

[Verse 2]
You've given me more than I can return
Yet there's oh so much that you deserve
Nothing to say, nothing to do
I've nothing to give, I must live without you
You know we're heading separate ways
You might also like[Chorus]
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

[Post-Chorus]
So I'll be on my way

[Chorus]
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

[Outro]
So I'll be on my way
So I'll be on my way61Embed
