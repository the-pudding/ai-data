(Love, love, love)
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E

[Verse 1]
In the moonlight
Under starlight
Songs old as the night are what I've been dreaming of
Everybody's hard as iron
Locked in a modern world
Dreams are made of a different stuff

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe love will always be the same (Love)
The ways and means are the parts subject to change

[Chorus]
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love

[Verse 2]
I can call you
Got your number
Share my life with you a thousand miles away
If you hurt me
I haven't shown it
Time's too tight to fight
And we're never face to face
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Style is timeless and fashion's only now (Love, love, love)
We got the ways, no one needs to show us how

[Chorus]
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love
(Love)

[Breakdown]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Love, love, love
Ooh, ooh
Method of, method of
Love, love, love
Love
Method of, method of
Love, love, love
Love

I do believe that I'm inclined to look ahead and not behind
(M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E)
I got the method, baby, and it's right on time
And it's a method of modern love
(It's a method of modern love)
