13 ContributorsThe First Night Lyrics[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Come on
Baby, baby, tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? What?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh? What?

[Verse 1: Monica]
Boy, this evening, was it only me?
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feelin' this way
Especially the thought of gettin' in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinkin'

I should make a move but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

[Verse 2: Monica]
We were chillin', watching your TV
I thought you was coming close as you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow, in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carryin' on
Tryin' to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me it's gettin' too late
I'm thinkin'

[Chorus: Monica]
I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (No way)
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night (I don't, I don't get down, baby)
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
(You're probably thinkin' something is wrong)
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
[Post-Chorus: Monica]
(If) If you want me
You got to know me (You got to know me)
And if you want my love (My love)
You gotta win my love

[Bridge: Monica]
Hey, baby
That's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me (Get to know me)
So we can do this

[Chorus: Monica]
I should make a move
I know you're probably thinkin' (I won't, I won't, babe)
Knowin' if I do (I won't, I won't, baby, yeah, yeah)
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't (No, no, no)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (No, no, no)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
I should make a move, but I won't (I should make a move)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
(Probably thinkin' something's wrong)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right (No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't get down on the first night (The first night)
I should make a move, but I won't (I should, baby)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (I should baby, yeah, yeah)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night (No, no, no, no, no)
[Outro]
I should make a move, but I won't (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
(You're probably thinkin' something is wrong)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right (No, no, no, no)
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first nightEmbed
