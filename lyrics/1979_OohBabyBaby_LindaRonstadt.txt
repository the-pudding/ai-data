6 ContributorsOoh Baby Baby Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, la la la

[Verse 1]
I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
And in the game I lost you
What a price to pay
I'm crying

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby

[Verse 2]
Mistakes
I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes, too
I'm crying

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
You might also like[Bridge]
I'm just about at
The end of my rope
But I can't stop trying
I can't give up hope

[Verse 3]
'Cause I'll be here
Someday I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here
Ooh, I'm crying

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby

[Outro]
