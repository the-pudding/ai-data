You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl, but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

[Verse 1: Daryl Hall & John Oates]
Don't you know? Don't you know?
That it's wrong to take what is given you
So far gone, on your own
You can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong, 'cause

[Chorus: Daryl Hall & John Oates]
You're a rich girl (Rich girl)
And you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl (Bitch, girl), and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)
Say money but it won't get you too far, get you too far

High and dry, out of the rain
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow, ooh
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live
For the thrill of it all, oh

[Chorus: Daryl Hall & John Oates]
You're a rich girl (Rich girl) and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl (Bitch, girl), and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway, yeah (Rich girl)
Say money but it won't get you too far
Say money but it won't get you too far
Say money but it won't get you too far, get you too far
And you say, you can rely on your old man's money
You can rely on your old man's money

[Outro: Daryl Hall & John Oates]
You're a rich girl (Rich girl)
A rich girl
Oh, you're a rich bitch girl, yeah (Rich girl)
Say money but it won't get you too far
Won't get you too far15Embed
