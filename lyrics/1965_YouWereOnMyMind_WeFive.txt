5 ContributorsYou Were on My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I woke up this mornin'
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind
I got troubles, whoa-oh
I got worries, whoa-oh
I got wounds to bind

[Verse 2]
So I went to the corner
Just to ease my pain
Said, just to ease my pain
I got troubles, whoa-oh
I got worries, whoa-oh
I came home again

[Verse 3]
But I woke up this mornin'
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind
(Yeah) I got troubles, whoa-oh
I got worries, whoa-oh
I got wounds to bind

[Verse 4]
Hey, I got a feelin'
Down in my shoes
Said a-way down in my shoes
Hey, I got to ramble, whoa-oh
I got to move on, whoa-oh
I got to walk away my blues

But I woke up this mornin'
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind
Hey, I got troubles, whoa-oh
I got worries, whoa-oh
I got wounds to bindEmbed
