7 ContributorsStay Lyrics(Stay) Ah, just a little bit longer (Stay)
(Please) Please, please, please
Tell me you're going to

Now your daddy don't mind
And your mommy don't mind
If we have another dance, yeah
Just one more (One more time)

Oh, won't you stay
Just a little bit longer?
Please let me dance
And say you will (Say you will)

Won't you place your sweet lips to mine?
Won't you say you love me all of the time?

(Stay) Oh yeah, just a little bit longer (Stay)
(Please) Please, please, please
Tell me you're going to

Come on, come on, come on, stay, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, stay, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, stay, whoops
Come on, come on, come on, stay, mama mamaYou might also likeEmbed
