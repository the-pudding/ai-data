Can make this world seem right
Only you
Can make the darkness bright
Only you, and you alone
Can thrill me like ya do
And fill my heart with love
For only you
Only you
Can make this change in me
For it's true!
You are my destiny
When you hold my hand, I understand
The magic that you do
Your my dream come true
My one and only you...
(speaking)
Only you
Can make this world seem right
Only you
Can make, my darkness bright
Only you, and you alone
Can thrill me like ya do
And fill my heart
With love for only you
Oh-only you
Can make this change in me
For it's true!
You are my destiny
When you hold my hand I understand
The magic that you do
Your my dream come true
My one, my one and only you
Only you, only you, only you.......See Ringo Starr LiveGet tickets as low as $61You might also likeEmbed
