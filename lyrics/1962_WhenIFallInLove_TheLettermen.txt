6 ContributorsWhen I Fall in Love Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus]
When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall
In love

[Verse]
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

[Chorus]
When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give
My heart
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
Is when I fall in love
When I fall in love
