70 ContributorsYou Rock My World Lyrics[Skit: Chris Tucker & Michael Jackson]
Oh man! Look at that girl right there!
Goodness gracious! Uh! That girl's fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine, too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Ahh-uh-uh-uh-uh, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right! Shamone, then, shamone!
Watch

[Intro: Michael Jackson]
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that
I, I, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk, the way I talk
And I cannot explain
The things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
So stay with me, fulfill my dreams
I'll be all you'll need

Have finally found a perfect love this time (See)
And I finally found, come on, girl

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own, I give ('Cause you rocked my world)
