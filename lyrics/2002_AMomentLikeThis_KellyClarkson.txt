11 ContributorsA Moment Like This Lyrics[Verse 1]
What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

[Chorus]
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

[Verse 2]
Everything changes, but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreamin', but 'til I awake
Can we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

[Chorus]
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
