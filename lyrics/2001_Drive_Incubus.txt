Sometimes I feel the fear of
Uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer
[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh

[Verse 2]
So if I decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Ohh-oh-ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that
When I drive myself my light is found

And whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh

[Bridge]
Would you choose the water over wine
Hold the wheel and drive?

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, ohh
