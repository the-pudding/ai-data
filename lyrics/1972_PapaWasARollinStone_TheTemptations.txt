33 ContributorsPapa Was a Rollinâ€™ Stone Lyrics[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said, son

[Chorus]
(Papa was a rolling stone)
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) All he left us was (Alone)
(Papa was a rolling stone) My son, yeah
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) All he left us was (Alone)
Well, well

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards, Melvin Williams and Richard Street]
Hey, mama
Is it true what they say, that papa never worked a day in his life?
And mama, some bad talk goin' round town
Sayin' that papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
I heard them talking 'bout papa doing some store front preachin'
Talkin' about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said

(Papa was a rolling stone) My son
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) All he left us was (Alone), hey
(Papa was a rolling stone) Dadgummit
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) All he left us was (Alone)
Uhh

[Verse 3: Damon Harris and Richard Street]
Hey, mama
I heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Hey, mama
Folks say papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son

[Chorus]
(Papa was a rolling stone) Well, well, well, well
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) Hey, yeah, huh
(And when he died) All he left us was alone-lone-lone-lone, alone
(Papa was a rolling stone) Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) Hey, yeah
(And when he died) All he left us was alone, I said
(Papa was a rolling stone) Yes, he was
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) Huh-huh-huh
(And when he died) All he left us was alone
My daddy was
(Papa was a rolling stone) Yes, he was hey yeah
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
[Outro]
