3 ContributorsStay the Same Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don’t you ever wish
You were someone else?
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don’t you ever say
You don’t like the way you are?
When you learn to love yourself
You’re better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
‘Cause there’s nothing ‘bout you I would change

[Pre-Chorus]
I think that you could be whatever you wanted to be
If you could realize all the dreams you have inside
Don’t be afraid if you got something to say
Just open up your heart and let it show you the way

[Chorus]
Don’t you ever wish
You were someone else?
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don’t you ever say
You don’t like the way you are?
When you learn to love yourself
You’re better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
‘Cause there’s nothing ‘bout you I would change
You might also like[Bridge]
Believe in yourself
Reach down inside
The love you find will set you free
Believe in yourself
You will come alive
Have faith in what you do
You’ll make it through, whoa, oh
Hey

[Chorus]
Don’t you ever wish
You were someone else?
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don’t you ever say
You don’t like the way you are?
When you learn to love yourself
You’re better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
‘Cause there’s nothing ‘bout you I would change

[Outro]
No, there’s nothing ‘bout you I would change
Don’t changeEmbed
