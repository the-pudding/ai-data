Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

[Chorus]
Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

[Verse 1]
When I saw you walkin' down the street
I said that's the kind of gal I'd like to meet
She's so pretty, Lord, she's fine
I'm gonna make her mine all mine

[Chorus]
Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

[Verse 2]
When you turned and walked away
That's when I wanna say
Come on, baby, give me a whirl
I wanna know if you'll be my girl
You might also like[Chorus]
Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

[Verse 3]
When you turned and walked away
That's when I wanna say
Come on, baby, give me a whirl
I wanna know if you'll be my girl

[Chorus]
Hey
Hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

[Outro]
Hey
Hey-ey-ey-eyEmbed
