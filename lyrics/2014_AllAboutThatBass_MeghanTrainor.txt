Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass (Bass, bass, bass, bass)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines (Ah-ha) working that Photoshop (Ah-ha)
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty (Ah-ha), just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma, she told me, "Don't worry about your size"
(Shoo-wop, wop, shoo-wop, wop)
She says, "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty, booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
(Shoo-wop, wop, shoo-wop, wop)
So, if that's what's you're into, then go ahead and move along

[Verse 2]
I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing, I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma, she told me (Woo!), "Don't worry about your size"
(Shoo-wop, wop, hey, shoo-wop, wop)
She says, "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty, booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
(Shoo-wop, wop, shoo-wop, wop, oh, no)
So, if that's what's you're into, then go ahead and move along (Ooh)

Hey, hey
