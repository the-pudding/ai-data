18 ContributorsIncense and Peppermints Lyrics[Intro]
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba

[Verse 1]
Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind
Dead kings, many things I can't define
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind
Incense and peppermints, the color of time

[Chorus]
Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

[Bridge]
Incense and peppermints, meaningless nouns
Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around
Look at yourself, look at yourself, yeah, girl
Look at yourself, look at yourself, yeah, girl, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
To divide the cockeyed world in two
Throw your pride to one side, it's the least you can do
Beatniks and politics, nothin' is new
A yardstick for lunatics, one point of view
You might also like[Chorus]
Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

[Verse 3]
Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind
Dead kings, many things I can't define
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind
Incense and peppermints, the color of time

[Chorus]
Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

[Outro]
Incense, peppermints
Incense, peppermints
