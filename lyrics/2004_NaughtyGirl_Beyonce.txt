I love to love you, baby (I love to love you, baby)
I love to love you, baby (I love to love you, baby)
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' sexy
I wanna hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burnin' flame
Feelin' kind of N-A-S-T-Y
Why I just might take you home with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me (Ah)
Start feeling so crazy, babe
Lately, I feel the funk comin' over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl (Uh)
I'm callin' all my girls
We gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
