How long
Has this been going on?
How long
Has this been going on?

[Verse 1]
Well, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
And you said you was never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

[Chorus]
How long
Has this been going on?
How long
Has this been going on?

[Verse 2]
Oh, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
Oh, you said you was never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day
You might also like[Outro]
And how long
Has this been going on?
How long
Has this been going on?
How long
How long
Has this been going on?
How long has this
How long
Has this been going on?
How long
And how long
Has this been going on?
How long
Has this been going on?
How long
How long
Has this been going....?3Embed
