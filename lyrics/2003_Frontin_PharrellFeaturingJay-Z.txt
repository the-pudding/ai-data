66 ContributorsFrontinâ€™ Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
I'm looking at you, uh
Sexy, yeah
Look how your ass is so fat
Wanna be again with you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me (I'm sorry baby, so sexy)
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe 'cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to
How fast we touched (Fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on
Never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin'
You know I want you, babe
I'm ready to bury it all
Unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya
You should stop frontin', babe

Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl, I love it, uh
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gonna call her, ask how it was
And she's gonna love it (Whoa-oh whoa, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to
How fast we touched (Fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on
Never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin'
(You know I want you, babe)
I'm ready to bury it all
Unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (I want ya)
(You should stop frontin', babe)

[Bridge: Jay-Z & Pharrell Williams]
Ho!
We got another one, Phar-real!
Dance
I call you "for real" (Ooh) cause you the truth, haha
Oh-woah
Young, great Hova (Oh-oh)
Uh (Dance), yeah (Ooh), let me talk to 'em
Oh-woah
I'mma keep it real (oh-oh)
[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Pharrell Williams]
Every time your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience
Like you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told
You threw me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin' what I'm feelin', Denzelin'
Actin' like you ain't appealin' when you are
Stuntin' like you ain't my only girl when you are
(I was just frontin')
I'm ready to stop when you are

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on
Never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin'
(You know I want you, babe)
I'm ready to bury it all
Unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (I want ya)
(You should stop frontin', babe)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
C'mon (ho!)
Dance, ooh
Oh-woah (oh), oh-oh
Dance (aoww!), ooh
Oh-woah (oh), oh-oh
You like this for real?
Thank you, baby
Look
I'm leavin' now
I'll see you later
I'ma see you through your window
