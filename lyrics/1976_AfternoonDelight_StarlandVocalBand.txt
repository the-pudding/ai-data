Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been "when it's right, it's right"
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

[Bridge]
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

[Chorus]
Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

[Verse 2]
Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you got some bait awaiting and I think I might
Like nibbling a little afternoon delight
You might also like[Chorus]
Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

[Bridge]
Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun gone down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

[Chorus]
Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
