Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

[Verse 1]
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Love, if you're there, come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I'll surely die if you're not there

[Chorus]
Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

[Verse 2]
I feel like they're looking for my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Voices from the sky say, "Rely
On your best friend to pull you through"
But even if I wanted to, I couldn't really, truly
'Cause my only friend is you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, come on
See Prince LiveGet tickets as low as $79You might also like[Chorus]
There are thieves in the temple tonight

[Verse 3]
Kicking me in my heart
Tearing me all apart (Tearing me, tearing me)
(Tearing me, tearing me all apart)
'Cause me and you could have been
A work of art (Thieves in the temple)

[Bridge]
Baby, don't you know I'm holding on
The best that I can?
Love, please help me be
A better man
Better than the thieves
(Thieves in the temple)
In the temple tonight
Oh, thieves in the temple
(Tonight) Tonight, hurt me

[Chorus]
Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight
(Thieves in the temple)
[Outro]
You said you loved me (Thieves in the temple)
You said I was your friend (Thieves in the temple)
You were supposed to take care of me
Love, come quick (Thieves in the temple)
You lie! Lie! Lie! (Love, come in a hurry)
(Thieves in the temple tonight)
Ahhhhhh!1Embed
