6 ContributorsAll I Ever Need Is You LyricsSometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Aww honey, all I ever need is you

You're my first love you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask
Aww honey, all I ever need is you

Winters come and they go
And we watch the melting snow
But sure as summer follows spring

All the things you do
Give me a reason to spend me life
Around you...

Some men follow rainbows I am told
Some men search for silver, some for gold
But I have found my treasure in your soul
My honey, all I ever need is you...

Without our love, I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my Honey
All I ever need is youYou might also likeEmbed
