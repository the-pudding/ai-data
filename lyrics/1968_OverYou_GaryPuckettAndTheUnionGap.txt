1 ContributorOver You LyricsOVER YOU
(Jerry Fuller)
GARY PUCKETT AND THE UNION GAP
Why all my loosin' sleep over you
Real livin' precious moments with you
So many days had gone by
Still I'm so lonely and I
Guess this just no getting over you
And there's nothin' I can do
Wastin' all of my time all of my mind over you
Within the prison words of my mind
If still apart of you let behind
And tho' it hurts I'll get by
Without your lovin' yet I
Guess this just no getting over you
And there's nothin' I can do
Wastin' all of my time all of my mind over you
And I guess this just no getting over you
And there's nothin' I can do
Wastin' all of my time all of my mind over you ...
