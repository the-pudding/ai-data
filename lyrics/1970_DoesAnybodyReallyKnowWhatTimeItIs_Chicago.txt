[Intro]

[Verse 1: Robert Lamm]
As I was walking down the street one day
A man came up to me and asked me
What the time was that was on my watch
Yeah... and I said

[Chorus: Robert Lamm, (Bandmates)]
(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so, I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to cry

[Verse 2: Robert Lamm]
And I was walking down the street one day
A pretty lady looked at me
And said her diamond watch had stopped cold dead
And I said

[Chorus: Robert Lamm, (Bandmates)]
(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so, I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to cry

And I was walking down the street one day
Being pushed and shoved by people
Trying to beat the clock, oh, no
I just don't know, I don't know, I don't know-oh
And I said... yes, I said

(Background:)
People runnin' everywhere
Don't know where to go
Don't know where I am
Can't see past the next step
Don't have time to think past the last one
Have no time to look around
Just run around, run around think why

[Chorus: Robert Lamm, (Bandmates)]
(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to die

[Outro: Robert Lamm, (Bandmates)]
Everybody's working
(I don't care) I don't care
(About time) About time
(Oh no, no) I don't careEmbed
