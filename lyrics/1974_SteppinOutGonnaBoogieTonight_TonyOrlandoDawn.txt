1 ContributorSteppin’ Out (I’m Gonna Boogie Tonight) Lyrics[Verse 1]
No I'm not upset, I'm not, lots of people get married
Please, I'm in a hurry, won't you straighten my tie? I'll get by
She was something else, she was, now she's gonna get married
She's got herself carried off by somebody new, what can I do?

[Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me, ma, I'll be alright
I'm steppin' out, I'm gonna boogie tonight
Dancing and singing love songs 'til the dawn's early light
Oh, I'm steppin' out, I'm gonna boogie tonight

[Verse 2]
Yes I must admit, we did, we looked so good together
Thought it would last forever, but I'm a dreamer at heart, dreams fall apart
Tell me where's my shoes, my groovy shoes?
Enough about Diana, oh my sweet Diana, she's getting married today

[Chorus]
Oh, don't worry 'bout me, ma, I'll be alright
I'm steppin' out, I'm gonna boogie tonight
Dancing and singing love songs 'til the dawn's early light
Oh, I'm steppin' out, ma, I'm gonna boogie tonight

[Instrumental]

Oh, my tender lips, they lied
They told me that she loved me
I'm just catching cold, ma
These aren't tears in my eyes

[Chorus]
So don't worry 'bout me, Ma, I'll be alright
See, I'm steppin' out, I'm gonna boogie tonight
Dancing and singing love songs 'til the dawn's early light
Oh, I'm steppin' out, Ma, I'm gonna boogie tonight

Dancing and singing, don't worry, I'll be alright
I'm steppin' out tonight, ooh, dancing and singingEmbed
