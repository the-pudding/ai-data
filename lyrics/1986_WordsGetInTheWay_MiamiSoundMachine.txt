5 ContributorsWords Get In the Way Lyrics[Verse 1:]
I realize you're seeing someone new
I don't believe she knows you like I do
Your temperamental moody side
The one you always try to hide from me

But I know when you have something on your mind
You've been trying to tell me
For the longest time
And before you break my heart in two
There's something I've been trying to say to you

[Chorus:]
But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes
We might fall in love again

I won't even start to cry
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say "I love you"
But the words got in the way

[Verse 2:]
Your heart has always been an open door
But baby I don't even know you anymore
And despite the fact it's hurting me
I know the time has come to set you free
You might also likeBut then I realize you're seeing someone new
I don't believe she knows you like I do
Your temperamental moody side
The one you always try to hide from me

But I know when you have something on your mind
You've been trying to tell me
For the longest time
And before you break my heart in two
There's something I've been trying to say to you

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Your heart has always been an open door
But baby I don't even know you any more
And despite the fact it's hurting me
I know the time has come to set you free

[Repeat Chorus:]

I'm trying to say "I love you"
But the words get in the way

There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say "I love you"
But the words got in the way

I'm trying to say "I love you"
But the words get in the wayEmbed
