Adia, I do believe I failed you
Adia, I know I've let you down
Don't you know I tried so hard
To love you in my way?
It's easy, let it go

[Verse 2]
Adia I'm empty since you left me
Trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence

[Chorus]
Cause we are born innocent
Believe me Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

Adia I thought that we could make it
I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
Your friend who won't betray

[Pre-Chorus]
I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
I show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe

[Chorus]
That we are born innocent
Believe me Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

[Bridge]
Cause we are born innocent
Believe me Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?
Believe me Adia
We are still innocent
[Chorus]
Cause we are born innocent
Believe me Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?2Embed
