[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
Bring it back to the time when you and me had just begun
When I was still your number one
Well it might seem far-fetched baby girl, but it can be done
I've got this feeling fire blazing and it's hot just like the sun
Know you feel it too, my girl
Just free it up, may the good vibes run
Girl take a sip of the champagne
Take a likkle trip down my lane my girl
Wildin' out every night weh you'll feel alright
Make I tell you this girl atta my world
Don't change, I'ma not rearrange that girl
Make mi tell you this straight this is a my word
A mi hear seh you want, come kiss this, girl cau' you miss this?
