(He likes toast and jam)
(That's what his baby feeds him)
(He's her loving man)

Well, I like bread and butter
I like toast and jam
That's what my baby feeds me
I'm her loving man

(He likes bread and butter)
(He likes toast and jam)
(That's what his baby feeds him)
(He's her loving man)

Well, she don't cook mashed potatoes
She don't cook T-bone steaks
She don't feed me peanut butter
She knows that I can't take

(He likes bread and butter)
(He likes toast and jam)
(That's what his baby feeds him)
(He's her loving man)

Well, I got home early one morning
Much to my surprise
She was eating chicken and dumplings
With some other guy

(With some other man)

No, no, no, no more bread and butter
No more toast and jam
I found my baby eating
With some other man

No, no, no, no (No more bread and butter)
No, no, no, no (No more toast and jam)
No, no, no, no (No more bread and butter)
No, no, no, no (No more toast and jam)
No, no, no, no (No more bread and butter)Embed
