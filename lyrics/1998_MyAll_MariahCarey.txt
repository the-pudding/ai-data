30 ContributorsMy All Lyrics[Intro]
Nah-mm-mm-mm
Nah, ooh, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1]
I am thinkin' of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then, my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you and I won't pull through
Without you by my side

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you feel me?
Imaginin' I'm lookin' in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet, you're so far, like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
You might also like[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Outro]
Give my all for your love
