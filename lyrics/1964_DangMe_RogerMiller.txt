9 ContributorsDang Me LyricsWell, here I sit high, gettin' ideas
Ain't nothin' but a fool could live like this
Out all night and runnin' wild
Woman's sittin' home with a month old child

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?

Just sittin' 'round drinkin' with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought, and I bought five
And I spent the groceries, and a half the rent
I lack fourteen dollars and a-twenty seven cents

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?

Roses are red and violets are purple
Ssugar's sweet and so is maple surple
Well I'm seventh out of seven sons
My pappy's a pistol, I'm a son of a gun

Well, dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?You might also likeEmbed
