It's just your jive talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin', you wear a disguise
Jive talkin', so misunderstood, yeah
Jive talkin', you're really no good

[Verse 1]
Oh, my child, you'll never know
Just what you mean to me
Oh, my child, you got so much
You gonna take away my energy

[Chorus]
With all your jive talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin' still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
It's just your jive talkin' that gets in the way (Oh my)

[Verse 2]
Oh, my love, you're so good
Treating me so cruel
There you go with your fancy lies
Leavin' me lookin' like a dumbstruck fool

[Chorus]
With all your jive talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin', you wear a disguise
Jive talkin', so misunderstood, yeah
Jive talkin', you just ain't no good
You know that love talkin' is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die
Then all that jive talkin' just gets in your eye, yeah (Woo)

Jive talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin' still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
It's just your jive talkin' that gets in the way
You know that love talkin' is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die
Then all that jive talkin' just gets in your eye, yeah, yeah
