We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair, but I thought, "How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?"

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Refrain: Andrew Taggart]
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Postin' pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Gettin' drunk on the past we were livin' in

[Bridge: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart]
Let's show them we are, show them we are
