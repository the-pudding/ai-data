11 ContributorsTo Sir with Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on, and on

[Pre-Chorus]
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
I'll try

[Chorus]
If you wanted the sky
Write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
"To Sir, with love"

[Verse 2]
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?
Oh, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love1Embed
