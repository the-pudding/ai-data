9 ContributorsBest Thing That Ever Happened To Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Gladys Knight]
I've had my share of life's ups and downs
But fate's been kind, the downs have been few
I guess you could say that I've been lucky
Well, I guess you could say that it's all because of you

[Chorus: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
If anyone should ever write my life story
(For whatever reason there might be)
For whatever reason there might be
Ooh, you'll be there between each line of pain and glory
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me
(You're the best thing that ever happened to me)
Ah, you're the best thing that ever happened to me

[Verse 2: Gladys Knight]
Oh, there have been times when times were hard
But always somehow I made it, I made it through
'Cause for every moment that I've spent hurting
There was a moment that I spent, ah, just loving you

[Chorus: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever, for whatever reason there might be
Oh, you'll be there between each line of pain and glory
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me
(You're the best thing that ever happened to me)
Oh, you're the best thing that ever happened to me
(You're the best thing that ever happened to me)
You might also like[Outro: Gladys Knight]
I know, you're the best thing, oh, that ever happened to me
