Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like​
Na-na-na-na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay (J-J-J-JR), replay

[Verse 1]
Remember the first time we met?
You was at the mall with your friend
I was scared to approach ya, but then you came closer
Hoping you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends?
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again

[Pre-Chorus]
(That girl) like something off a poster
(That girl) is a dime they say
(That girl) is a gun to my holster
And she's running through my mind all day, ayy

[Verse 2]
See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn'
Girl, you really changed my life
Doin' things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cooking things she likes
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife

And she's running through my mind all day, ayy

Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
