4 ContributorsStroke You Up Lyrics[Intro: R. Kelly, Changing Faces]
Yeah, so what you wanna see me for, baby?
I wanna show you something
Oh yeah, and what's that?
Turn the lights down halfway
Huh, ayo that's cool

[Chorus: Changing Faces, R. Kelly]
Do you mind if I stroke you up? (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down? (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Holding your body tight (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you up? (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down? (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Making you feel so right (I don't mind)

[Verse 1: Changing Faces]
Come on in and close the door
I've got what you're looking for
Dim the lights, unplug the phone
And turn the radio on
I've got what you need
Just put your trust in me
And I won't let you down
So give me your love right now
