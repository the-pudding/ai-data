8 ContributorsSugar Daddy Lyrics[Verse 1: Michael and Jermaine]
Ooh, brand new boots I bought ya
Fine, fine, blew your mind
Finally thought I caught ya
And your love was mine all mine
I see you walk by with other guys
Step, step, steppin' on my toes
The whole town's talkin' about how I'm
Your stand by Santa Claus

[Pre-Chorus]
But ooh, your kisses thrill me
Sure love your angel eyes
The devil in you kills me
But I made up my mind

[Chorus: Michael and Jermaine]
I'm gonna be your sugar daddy
Give you honey, all my money
Well, L.A to Cincinnati
That's how far I'd crawl for you
Oh baby, I'll be your sugar daddy
Give you kissin' when it's missin', yeah
Oh baby, I'll try to keep you happy
'Cause I got a sweet tooth for your love
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Jermaine and Michael]
(S-U-G) Listen to me, listen to me
(A-R) What it is, what it is, now
(D-A-D-D-Y) Spells "I'm your good thing"

[Verse 2: Michael and Jermaine]
'King of Fools' they crown me
And that crown just fits me to a T
'Cause you only come around me
Just to pick up what you need
You just play on my emotions
With "please, please, pretty please"
Well everybody's got the notion
I'm your goodwill industry

[Breakdown: Michael]
(Oh Henry)
He's driving me nuts
While I'm givin' you the candy
He's gettin' all your love
(Mary Jane said)
Mary Jane said I'm just your lollipop (Sucka)
Well my flavour's long lastin' girl
It ain't never gonna stop, no

[Bridge: Jermaine and Michael]
Baby, I'm a fool
Just a fool in love with you
I can't help myself
Oh no, oh no
I can't help myself
Na, na, na
[Chorus: Michael and Jermaine]
I'm gonna be your sugar daddy
Give you honey, all my money
From L.A to Cincinnati
That's how far I'd crawl for you
Oh baby, I'll be your sugar daddy
Give you kissin' when it's missin', yeah
Ooh baby, I'll even let you drive my caddy!
When I get one, baby! Oh, oh, oh

I'm gonna be your sugar daddy
Give you honey, all of my money
From L.A to Cincinnati
That's how far I'd crawl for you
Oh, I'm gonna be your sugar daddyEmbed
