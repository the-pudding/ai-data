I started a joke
Which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see
That the joke was on me, oh no

[Verse 2]
I started to cry
Which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

[Chorus]
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

[Verse 3]
'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

[Chorus]
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen, oh yeah
That the joke was on me

[Outro]
Oh no, that the joke was on me, oh13Embed
