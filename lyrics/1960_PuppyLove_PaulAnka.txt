And they called it puppy love
Oh, I guess they'll never know
How a young heart really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're, we're seventeen
Tell them all it, please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream

[Verse 2]
I cry each night my tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope and I'll pray that maybe someday
You'll be back (You'll be back), in my arms (in my arms)
Once again (Will be back in my arms once again)

[Verse 3]
Someone help me, help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I, oh, how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love? (This is not a puppy love)
Someone help me, help me, help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I ever tell them
This is not a puppy love?
