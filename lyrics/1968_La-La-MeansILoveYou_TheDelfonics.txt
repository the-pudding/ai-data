Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by (Passed them by)
Though you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try? (Let me try)
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing
All I know is

[Chorus]
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la means
I love you
Oh, baby, please now
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la means
I love you

[Verse 2]
If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me (One for me)
Let me hold you in my arms
Girl, and thrill you with my charms
I'm sure you will see (You will see)
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Listen to me
You might also like[Chorus]
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la means
I love you
Oh, baby baby
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la means
I love you

[Verse 2]
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you, yes, to you
Listen to me

[Chorus]
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la means
I love you
Oh, you'll have to understand now
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la means
I love you
Come on and take my hand, yeah
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la means2Embed
