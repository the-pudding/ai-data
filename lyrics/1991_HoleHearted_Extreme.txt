12 ContributorsHole Hearted Lyrics[Intro]
Oooh yeah wooh!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
Life´s ambition occupy my time
Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness one step behind
This inner peace I've yet to find

[Pre-Chorus]
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I´m not blind why can't I see
That a circle can´t fit where a square should be?

[Chorus]
There´s a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can´t be filled with the things I do
Hole hearted
Hole hearted

[Verse 2]
This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay keep warm inside
Day by day less satisfied
Not fade away before I die
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I´m not blind why can´t I see
Ooh, that a circle can´t fit where a square should be?

[Chorus]
There´s a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can´t be filled with the things I do

[Chorus 2]
There´s a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
Should have known from the start
I´d fall short with the things I do
Hole hearted,  hole hearted
Hole hearted,  hole hearted

[Outro]
Hole hearted,  hole hearted
Yeah
Yee haw!2Embed
