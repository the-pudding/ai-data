7 ContributorsLove Letters Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write

[Verse 2]
I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darlin', then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart

[Verse 2]
I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darlin', then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heartYou might also likeEmbed
