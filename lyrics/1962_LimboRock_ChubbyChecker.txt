Every Limbo boy and girl
All around the Limbo world
Gonna do the Limbo rock
All around the Limbo clock

[Chorus]
Jack be Limbo, Jack be quick
Jack go under Limbo stick
All around the Limbo clock
Hey, let's do the Limbo rock, ah-ha-ha-ha-how

[Post-Chorus]
Limbo lower now
Limbo lower now
How low can you go?

[Verse 2]
First you spread your limbo feet
Then you move to limbo beat
Limbo ankle, Limbo knee
Bend back like a limbo tree

[Chorus]
Jack be Limbo, Jack be quick
Jack go under limbo stick
All around the limbo clock
Hey, let's do the limbo rock, ooh, hoo-hoo, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 3]
Get yourself a Limbo girl
Give that chick a Limbo whirl
There's a Limbo moon above
You will fall in Limbo love

[Chorus]
Jack be Limbo, Jack be quick
Jack go under Limbo stick
All around the Limbo clock
Hey, let's do the Limbo rock, ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-ha-ha

[Post-Chorus]
Don't move that Limbo bar
You'll be a Limbo star
How low can you go?
