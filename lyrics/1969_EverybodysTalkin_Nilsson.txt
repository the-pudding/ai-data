20 ContributorsEverybody’s Talkin’ Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind
People stoppin', starin'
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

[Chorus]
I'm going where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off of the northeast winds
Sailin' on a summer breeze
And skippin' over the ocean like a stone

[Bridge]
Wah, wah-wah-wah-wah
Wah-wah-wah-wah, wah-wah-wah
Wah

[Chorus]
I'm going where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off of the northeast winds
Sailin' on a summer breeze
And skippin' over the ocean like a stone
You might also like[Verse 2]
Everybody's talkin' at me
Can't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

[Outro]
I won't let you leave my love behind
No I won't let you leave
Wah-wah, ah
I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave...2Embed
