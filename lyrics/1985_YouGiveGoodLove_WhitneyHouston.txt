20 ContributorsYou Give Good Love Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see, yeah

[Chorus]
That you give good love to me
Baby, it's so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me (You give good love to me)
It's never (Never too much, will never be) too much
Baby, you give good love (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Never stopping
I was always searching for that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of, mm
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

[Chorus]
That you give good love to me
Baby, it's so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me (You give good love to me)
It's never (Never too much, will never be) too much
Baby, you give good love, ooh

[Bridge]
Now I, I can't stop looking around
It's not what this love's all about
Our love is here to stay, to stay

[Chorus]
Baby, you give good love (You give good love to me)
You give (Never too much, will never be)
So good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me (You give good love to me)
It's never (Never too much, will never be), never too much
No, no, no, no, no, you give good love to me
[Outro]
(You give good love to me) It's so good
(You give good love, baby) So good, woo-hoo
(You give good love, darling)
Into your hands (You give, you give, give it)
(You give good love, honey) Woo-hoo
(You give good love, baby)
(You give good love, darling)
(You give, you give, give it)
(You give good love to me) Good love
(You give good love, baby) Good love, yeah, you do
(You give, you give, give it)
(You give good love, darling) You know what I need
(You give, you give, give it) Never too much, never will be
