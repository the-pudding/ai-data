"Hi! We're not in right now
But if you leave your name and number
We'll get back to you, to you, to you" *laughing*

[Verse 1]
I got all this love, waiting just for you
I just gotta know, that your love is true
Can't keep running, boy, in and out my life
Wanna be your girl, not 'cause the mood is right

[Pre-Chorus]
If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide
Will you be there for me when I need someone to hold?
Baby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man
I just need a little time before I invest my love

[Chorus]
Don't walk away, boy (Ooh, don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No, no)
Don't walk away, boy
I'll be right there for you

[Verse 2]
You say all the things, that I like to hear
You push all my buttons, baby
Love to have you close to me
Wanna feel your love, wanna be for sure
That it's me you need, baby, each and every night
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide
Will you be there for me when I need someone to hold?
Baby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man
I just need a little time before I invest my love

[Chorus]
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away, boy)
My love won't hurt you (No)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you

[Bridge]
Baby, don't misunderstand
I want you for my man
I need a little time
Before I give you my love
(Don't walk away, boy) Don't walk away
(I'll be right there for you)

Don't walk away

This is what it sounds like when we make love
(Don't walk away, boy)
(Don't walk away, boy)
(I'll be right there for you)
Don't walk away

[Chorus]
Don't walk away, boy (No)
My love won't hurt you (Won't hurt you)
Don't walk away, boy
I'll be right there for you (I'll be right there, oh yeah)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No)
Don't walk away, boy
I'll be right there for you6Embed
