8 ContributorsThere Youâ€™ll Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get
To have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me

[Chorus]
In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there'll always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am, there you'll be

[Verse 2]
Well, you showed me how it feels
To feel the sky within my reach
And I always will remember all
The strength you gave to me
Your love made me make it through
Oh, I owe so much to you
You were right there for me

[Chorus]
In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be

'Cause I always saw in you, my light, my strength
And I wanna thank you now for all the ways
You were right there for me (You were right there for me)
You were right there for me
For always

[Chorus]
In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there'll always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am, there you'll be

[Outro]
