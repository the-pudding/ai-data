Blue Moon Moon Moon Moon

Blue Moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue Moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me."
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold, oh

Blue Moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my ownYou might also like2Embed
