8 ContributorsJingle Jangle Lyrics[Intro]
Sing me, sing me, sing me
Sing me, sing me, baby, ooh

[Chorus]
La-da-da, la-da-da (sing me, sing me, sing me, yeah)
La-da-da, la-da-da (sing the jingle jangle song)
La-da-da, la-da-da (sing me, sing me, baby, yeah)
La-da-da, la-da-da

[Verse 1]
Ever since I met 'cha, I couldn't want you better
I couldn't love you stronger if I tried
It's my true heart I'm showin'
Or my nose would be growin'
You know that it gets longer when I lie

[Chorus]
Singin' la-da-da, la-da-da (sing me, sing me, sing me, yeah)
La-da-da, la-da-da (sing the jingle jangle song)
La-da-da, la-da-da (ooh, sing it, baby, yeah)
La-da-da, la-da-da

[Verse 2]
Bein' kinda pretty and down here in the city
You'll find it isn't easy to be smart
When tryin' to untangle the jingle from the jangle
It's easy if you listen with your heart
You might also like[Chorus]
Singin' la-da-da, la-da-da (sing me, sing me, sing me, yeah)
La-da-da, la-da-da (sing the jingle jangle song)
La-da-da, la-da-da (sing me, sing me, baby, yeah)
La-da-da, la-da-da

[Verse 3]
We'll make the winter springtime
And jingle jangle sing time
Right on through the summer and the fall
So darlin', don't be weepin'
And please don't you be sleepin'
When I come creepin' down the hall to sing ya

[Bridge]
La-da-da, la-da-da (sing me, sing me, sing me, yeah)
La-da-da, la-da-da (woah, come on)
(Oh, come on) Baby, get it together
(Woah, come on)
(Oh, come on) Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Woah, come on)
(Oh, come on) Baby, get it together
(Woah, come on)
(Oh, come on) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

[Chorus]
La-da-da, la-da-da (sing the jingle jangle song)
La-da-da, la-da-da (ooh, sing me, baby)
La-da-da, la-da-da (sing the jingle jangle song)
La-da-da, la-da-da (ooh, sing me, baby)Embed
