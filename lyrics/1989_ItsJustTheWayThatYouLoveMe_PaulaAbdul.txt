8 Contributors(Itâ€™s Just) The Way That You Love Me Lyrics[Intro]
The way that you love me
The way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me (Uh!)
Way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me

[Verse 1]
It ain't the clothes that you wear, uh
It ain't the things that you buy
It ain't your house on the hill
It ain't the plane that you fly
It ain't your black limousine
It ain't your ninety-foot, aah, yacht
It ain't the things that you'll get, ah
It ain't the things that you got

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey, I ain't impressed with your material things

[Chorus]
It's just the way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me (Baby)
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me (Babe)

It ain't your friends at the top, uh
It ain't their fortune and fame
It ain't your heavy connections
It ain't the Hollywood game

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't famous people or the parties they throw
Honey, I ain't impressed with all the people you know

[Chorus]
It's just the way that you love me (In the heat of the night)
It's just the way that you love me (Baby), uh
The way that you love me (When you're lovin' me right)
It's just the way that you love me (Baby)
It's just the way that you love me (And the things that you do)
It's just the way that you love me (Baby), uh
It's just the way that you love me (Make me crazy for you)
It's just the way that you love me, uh (Baby)

[Breakdown]
Break it down, huh
That's right (Woo!)
Keep it right there
Ow! I like that
Ha...
Guitar
[Refrain]
It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey, I ain't impressed with those material things

[Verse 3]
It ain't the trips to Brazil, uh
It ain't the weekends in Rome (Baby)
It ain't the French Riviera
You know I'd rather stay home

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't the Bahamas, it ain't Monaco
Honey, I ain't impressed with all the places we go

[Chorus]
It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me (Baby), uh
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me (Baby)
The way that you love me (It ain't the money)
It's just the way that you love me (Or the diamond rings)
The way that you love me (Ain't what you buy me, baby)
It's just the way that you love me (Ain't material things)
The way that you love me (Ain't your Maserati)
It's just the way that you love me (Your house on the hill)
The way that you love me (It ain't the parties)
It's just the way that you love me (Or the trips to Brazil)

Go, girl!
Watch me dancin'Embed
