2 ContributorsThe Love I Lost (Part 1) LyricsI can remember planning
Building my whole world around you
And I can remember hoping
That you and I could make it on through

But something went wrong
We loved each other
We just couldn't get along
Take a good look at me
I'm in misery, can't you see?

The love I lost
(The love, the love I lost)
Was a sweet love
(It was a sweet love)
The love I lost
(The love, the love I lost)
Was complete love
(It was complete love)

The love I lost
(The love I lost)
I will never, no, no, never
(Never, never)
Love again, ooh
You might also likeI can't remember nothing, no no
But the good times we used to share
I'm so sad and lonely
Without you, my life is so dead

I'm sorry to say
You go your way and I'll go my way
It hurts deep inside
The day we said goodbye, but

The love I lost
(The love, the love I lost)
Was a sweet love
(It was a sweet love)
The love I lost
(The love, the love I lost)
Was complete love
(It was complete love)

The love I lost, ooh, ooh
I will never, no, no, never
(Never, never)
Love again
(I'll never love again)
I will never, no, no, never
(Never, never)
Love again, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I will never, no, no, never
(Never, never)
Love again
The love, the love I lost, ooh
The love, the love I lost

The love I lost
(The love, the love I lost)
Was a sweet love
(It was a sweet love)
The love I lost
(The love, the love I lost)
Was complete love
(It was complete love)

The love I lost, ooh, ooh
I will never, no, no, never
(Never, never)
Love again
(I'll never love again)
I will never, no, no, never
(Never, never)
Love again, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I will never, no, no, never
(Never, never)
Love againEmbed
