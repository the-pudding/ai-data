Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way, no, I can't exist
I'll surely miss your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way

[Chorus]
(Ahh) Baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
Come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
(Set me free, set me free)

[Verse 2]
Don't, don't you leave me this way, no
Don't you understand, I'm at your command?
Oh baby, please, please don't leave me this way, no, baby
Don't leave me this way, no
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love
Baby, don't leave me this way
