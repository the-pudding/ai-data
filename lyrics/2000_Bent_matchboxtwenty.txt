15 ContributorsBent Lyrics[Verse 1]
And if I fall along the way
Pick me up and dust me off
And if I get too tired to make it
Be my breath so I can walk
And if I need some other love, then
Give me more than I can stand
And when my smile gets old and faded
Wait around, I'll smile again

[Pre-Chorus]
Shouldn't be so complicated
Just hold me and then
Oh, just hold me again

[Chorus]
Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

[Verse 2]
And if I couldn't sleep, could you sleep?
Could you paint me better off?
And could you sympathize with my needs?
I know you think I need a lot

I started out clean but I'm jaded
Just phoning it in
Oh, just breaking the skin

[Chorus]
Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

[Bridge]
Start bending me
It's never enough till I feel all your pieces
Start bending me
Keep bending me until I'm completely broken in

[Pre-Chorus]
Shouldn't be so complicated
Just touch me and then
Oh, just touch me again

[Chorus]
Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me landin' without understanding
Hell, I'd go there again
Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Yeah, you're breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent6Embed
