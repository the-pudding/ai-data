10 ContributorsWhen Itâ€™s Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody's looking for something
Something to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
'Til things get out of control, oh

[Chorus]
How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Oh, how does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together
When it's love

[Verse 2]
You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessing
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson

[Chorus]
How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Oh, how does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together

[Refrain]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Oh, when it's love
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) You can feel it, yeah
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Nothing's missing, yeah
