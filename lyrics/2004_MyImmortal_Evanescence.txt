I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

[Chorus]
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

[Verse 2]
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
And now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

[Pre-Chorus]
And these wounds won't seem to heal
And this pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have

[Bridge]
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

[Chorus]
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me, ah

[Outro]
Me, ah
Me, ah86Embed
