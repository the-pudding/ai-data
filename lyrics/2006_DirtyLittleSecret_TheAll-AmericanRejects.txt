30 ContributorsDirty Little Secret Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let me know that I've done wrong
When I've known this all along
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know

[Chorus]
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, who has to know?

[Verse 2]
When we live such fragile lives
It's the best way we survive
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, who has to know?

[Bridge]
The way she feels inside (Inside)
Those thoughts I can't deny (Deny)
These sleeping dogs won't lie (Won't lie)
And all I've tried to hide
It's eating me apart
Trace this line back

[Interlude]
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret)

[Outro]
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, dirty little secret
Dirty little secret, who has to know? Who has to know?21Embed
