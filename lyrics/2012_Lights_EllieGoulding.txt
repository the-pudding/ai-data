I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now
The strength I need to push me

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone (Home)
You shine it when I'm alone (Home)

[Verse 2]
Noises
I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathin'
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe
You might also like[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone (Home)
You shine it when I'm alone (Home)

[Post-Chorus]
(Lights, lights, lights, lights)
(Lights, lights, lights, lights)
Home, home (Lights, lights, lights, lights)
(Lights, lights)

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone (Home)
You shine it when I'm alone (Home)
[Post-Chorus]
Home, home (Lights, lights, lights, lights)
(Lights, lights, lights, lights)
Home, home (Lights, lights, lights, lights)
(Lights, lights, lights, lights)45Embed
