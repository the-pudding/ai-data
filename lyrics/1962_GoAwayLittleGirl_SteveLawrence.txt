Go away, little girl
Go away, little girl
I'm not supposed to be alone with you
I know that your lips are sweet
But our lips must never meet
I belong to someone else and I must be true

[Verse 2]
Oh, go away, little girl
Go away, little girl
It's hurtin' me more each minute that you delay
When you are near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So, go away, little girl, before I beg you to stay

[Bridge]
Go away
Please don't stay
It'll never work out
When you are near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So, go away, little girl
Call it a day, little girl
Oh, please, go away, little girl
Before I beg you to stay
