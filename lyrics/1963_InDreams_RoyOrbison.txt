26 ContributorsIn Dreams Lyrics[Intro]
A candy-colored clown they call the sandman
Tiptoes to my room every night
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper
"Go to sleep, everything is alright"

[Verse 1]
I close my eyes, then I drift away
Into the magic night, I softly say
A silent prayer like dreamers do
Then I fall asleep to dreams, my dreams of you

[Chorus]
In dreams, I walk with you
In dreams, I talk to you
In dreams, you're mine all of the time
We're together in dreams, in dreams

[Post-Chorus]
But just before the dawn
I awake and find you gone
I can't help it, I can't help it if I cry
I remember that you said goodbye

[Outro]
It's too bad that all these things
Can only happen in my dreams
Only in dreams
In beautiful dreamsYou might also like4Embed
