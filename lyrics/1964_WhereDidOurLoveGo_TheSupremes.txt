Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

[Verse 2]
I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

[Verse 3]
You came into my heart (Baby, baby)
So tenderly (Where did our love go?)
With a burning love (Baby, baby)
That stings like a bee (Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby)

[Verse 4]
Now that I surrender (Baby, baby)
So helplessly (Where did our love go?)
You now wanna leave (Baby, baby)
Ooh, you wanna leave me (Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby)

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, baby (Baby, baby)
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me? (Baby, baby)
Don't you want me no more? (Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby)
Ooh, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
And all your promises (Baby, baby)
Of a love forever more (Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby)

[Verse 2]
I've got this burning, burning, yearning (Baby, baby)
Feelin' inside me (Where did our love go?)
Ooh, deep inside me (Baby, baby)
And it hurts so bad (Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby)

[Verse 5]
Before you won my heart (Baby, baby)
You were a perfect guy (Where did our love go?)
But now that you got me (Baby, baby)
You wanna leave me behind (Baby, baby)
Ooh, baby

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby (Baby, baby)
Baby don't leave me (Where did our love go?)
Ooh, please don't leave me (Baby, baby)
All by myself, ooh (Baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby)
[Outro]
Baby, baby (Baby, baby)
Where did our love go?2Embed
