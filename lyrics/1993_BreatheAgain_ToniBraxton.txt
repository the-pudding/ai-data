20 ContributorsBreathe Again Lyrics[Chorus]
If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear "I love you" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, yeah)

[Verse 1]
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the love that you made to me
And I can't get you outta my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away?

And I can't stop carin' about
About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the center of my life
And I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again
You might also like[Chorus]
If I never feel you in my arms again (Again)
If I never feel your tender kiss again (Again)
If I never hear "I love you" now and then (And then)
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand if love ends (Please understand, if)
Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way my life would be
No I can't stop thinkin' about
How could you love me then leave?
And I can't get you out of my mind
God knows how hard I've tried
And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die

And I can't stop doin' without, no
(Without the rhythm of my heart)
No, I can't stop doin' without, no
(For I would surely fall apart)
And I can't get you out of my mind
('Cause I know I can't deny it)
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again
[Chorus]
If I never feel you in my arms again (If I never ever see you)
If I never feel your tender kiss again (No, no, no, no)
If I never hear "I love you" now and then (Now and then)
Will I never make love to you once again? (Will I never make love, never make love?)
Please understand if love ends (Please, please understand, if it should ever end, oh no)
Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, breathe again) (No, no, no)
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, breathe again) (No, no, no)
That I shall never breathe
(Breathe again)
