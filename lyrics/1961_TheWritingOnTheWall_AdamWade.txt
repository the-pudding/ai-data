1 ContributorThe Writing On The Wall LyricsThe love light's gone from your eyes
You're telling me little white lies
It seems you're not at home
Each time I call
(Each time you call)
I guess that I'd be a fool
Not to know your heart's grown cruel
I see the writing on
The wall (on the wall)
It's not too hard to
Read between the lines, dear
So plain to see love
Didn't conquer all
Its not too hard
To recognize the signs, dear
I see the writing on the wall
(Writing on the wall)
Friends say, this won't be the end
You'll want my love again
But my heart knows
Better than them all
(Better than them all)
This time I feel it's goodbye
Excuse me if I cry
But I see the writing
On the wall (on the wall)
It's not too hard to
Read between the lines, dear
It's plain to see love
Didn't conquer all
It's not too hard
To recognize the signs, dear
I see the writing on the wall
I see the writing on the wallYou might also likeEmbed
