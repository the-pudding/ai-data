19 ContributorsFire Lyrics[Intro]
I am the god of hellfire! And I bring you

[Chorus]
Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn
I'll see you burn

[Verse 1]
You fought hard and you saved and earned
But all of it's going to burn

[Pre-Chorus]
And your mind, your tiny mind
You know you've really been so blind
Now's your time, burn your mind
You're falling far, too far behind
Oh no, oh no, oh no!
You're gonna burn

[Chorus]
Fire, to destroy all you've done
Fire, to end all you've become
I'll feel you burn

[Verse 2]
You've been living like a little girl
In the middle of your little world
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And your mind, your tiny mind
You know you've really been so blind
Now's your time, burn your mind
You're falling far, too far behind
Ooh

[Chorus]
Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn

[Bridge]
You're gonna burn, you're gonna burn
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn

[Outro]
Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn
Fire, I'll take you to bed
Fire, I'll take you, fireâ€¦4Embed
