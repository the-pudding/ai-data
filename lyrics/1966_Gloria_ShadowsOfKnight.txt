Like to tell you 'bout my baby, you know she come around
She 'bout five feet four, a-from her head to the ground
Well she comes around here just about midnight
Make me feel so good, make me feel alright
And her name is G-L-O-R-I, I-I I

[Chorus]
G-L-O-R-I-A (Gloria)
G-L-O-R-I-A (Gloria)
I'm gonna shout all night (Gloria)
Gonna shout it every place (Gloria)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
She comes around here a-just about midnight
She make me feel so good
I wanna tell you she make me feel alright
Comes walkin' down my street
Why don't you come up to my house?
And knock upon my door
Then she call out my name
That make me feel alright

[Chorus]
G-L-O-R-I-A (Gloria)
G-L-O-R-I-A (Gloria)
I'm gonna shout all night (Gloria)
And shout it every place (Gloria)
