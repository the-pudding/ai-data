3 ContributorsRaindrops Lyrics[Chorus]
Oh, raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops
Falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes

[Verse 1]
Since my love has left me
I'm so all alone
I would bring her back to me
But I don't know where she's gone
I don't know where she's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be a cloud in my head
Rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes
Oh, no it can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry

[Chorus]
So it must be raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops
Falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there must be a cloud in my head
Rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes
Oh, no it can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry

[Chorus]
So it must be raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops
Falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes

[Outro]
It keeps on fallin'
Fallin' from my eyes
Whoo, it keeps on fallin' from my eyes
Falling from my eyes1Embed
