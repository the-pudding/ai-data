Out of all the reindeers, you know you're the mastermind
Run, run, Rudolph, Randolph ain't too far behind

[Chorus]
Run, run, Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run, Rudolph cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

[Verse 1]
Said Santa to a boy, "Child, what have you been longing for?"
"All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar"
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a shooting star

[Chorus]
Run, run, Rudolph, Santa has to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run, Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Run, run, Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run, Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl, "Child, what would please you most to get?"
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink, and wet"
And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a Sabre jet

[Chorus]
Run, run, Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run, Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-roundEmbed
