(Hitchhike
Hitchhike)

[Verse 1]
(Popeye) Standin' on the side of the street, uh-huh
(Hitchhike, hitchhike)
(Popeye) Clappin' both his hands to the beat, oh yeah
(Hitchhike, hitchhike, yeah) Hey
(Popeye) Tryin' hard to bum a ride
(Popeye) Tryin' but no come around
They go by, hey (Popeye)

[Chorus]
(Well, now clap your hands and thumb your thumb
That's how the Popeye dance is done)

[Verse 2]
(Popeye) Standin' there, and it's gettin' cold, oh yeah
(Hitchhike, hitchhike)
(Popeye) Shakin' now to warm up his soul, uh-huh-huh
(Hitchhike, hitchhike) Hey
(Popeye) Double timin' with that thumb
(Popeye) Tryin' but nobody come
They go by, hey (Popeye)
