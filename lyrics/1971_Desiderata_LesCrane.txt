You are a child of the universe
No less than the trees and the stars
You have a right...

Desiderata, desiderata, desiderata

[Verse 1]
Go placidly amid the noise and haste
And remember what peace there may be in silence
As far as possible without surrender
Be on good terms with all persons
Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others -
Even the dull and ignorant, they too have their story
Avoid loud and aggressive persons - they are vexations to the spirit
If you compare yourself with others
You may become vain and bitter
For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself

[Chorus]
You are a child of the universe
No less than the trees and the stars
You have a right to be here
And whether or not it is clear to you
No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should
You might also like[Verse 2]
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans
Keep interested in your own career -
However humble, it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time
Exercise caution in your business affairs
For the world is full of trickery
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is
Many persons strive for high ideals
And everywhere life is full of heroism
Be yourself!
Especially do not feign affection, neither be cynical about love
For in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
It is as perennial as the grass
Take kindly the counsel of the years
Gracefully surrendering the things of youth
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune
But do not distress yourself with imaginings -
Many fears are borne of fatigue and loneliness
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself

[Chorus]
You are a child of the universe (You are a child of the universe)
No less than the trees and the stars (No less than the trees and the stars)
You have a right to be here (You have a right to be here)
And whether or not it is clear to you (And whether or not it is clear to you)
No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should (No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should)
[Verse 3]
Therefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him to be
And whatever your labors and aspirations
In the noisy confusion of life
Keep peace with your soul
With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams
It is still a beautiful world
Be careful. Strive to be happy

[Chorus]
You are a child of the universe
No less than the trees and the stars
You have a right to be here

You are a child of the universe
No less than the trees and the stars
You have a right to be here

You are a child of the universe
No less than the trees and the stars
You have a right to be here

You are a child of the universe
No less than the trees and the stars
You have a right to be here
You are a child of the universe
No less than the trees and the stars
You have a right to be here1Embed
