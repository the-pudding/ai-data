You ready for me?

I wanna know so I can do it all night
But you're tellin' me I'm just a friend
You're tellin' me I'm just a friend

Oh baby you (Oh baby, you)
Got what I need (Got what I need)
But you say I'm just a friend (Say I'm just a friend)
But you say I'm just a friend
'Cause I can be your ('Cause I can be your) fantasy
But you say I'm just a friend (Say I'm just a friend)
But you say I'm just a friend (Yeah)

I wanna know you in and out
I wanna know what you're all about (I wanna know)
I wanna know what makes you laugh
I wanna know about your past
I wanna know how you move
