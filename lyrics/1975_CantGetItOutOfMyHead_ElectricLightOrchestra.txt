25 ContributorsCanâ€™t Get It Out of My Head Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Midnight on the water
I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave's chicane
Staring as she called my name

[Chorus]
And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

[Verse 2]
Breakdown on the shoreline
Can't move, it's an ebb tide
Morning don't get here tonight
Searching for her silver light

[Chorus]
And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no, no

[Verse 3]
Bank job in the city
Robin Hood and William Tell, Ivanhoe and Lancelot
They don't envy me, yeah
Sitting 'til the sun goes down
In dreams, the world keeps going
'Round and 'round

[Chorus]
And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no, no

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no, no, no, no6Embed
