And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I first saw you
And it's been awhile
Since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile
Since I could call you

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

[Verse 2]
And it's been awhile
Since I could say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile
Since I can say I love myself as well
And it's been awhile
Since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile
But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again, again

[Bridge]
Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day

[Verse 3]
And it's been awhile
Since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile
Since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile
But I can still remember just the way you taste

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me
[Outro]
And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I said I'm sorry29Embed
