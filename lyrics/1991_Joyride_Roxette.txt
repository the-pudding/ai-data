14 ContributorsJoyride Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
C'mon, join the joyride, everybody
Get your tickets here
Step right this way

[Chorus]
Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride

[Verse 1]
I hit the road out of nowhere
I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars

Don't need a book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all

[Verse 2]
She has a train going downtown
She's got a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon

She's the heart of the funfair
She's got me whistling a private tune
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 1]
And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

[Chorus]
She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride."
Join the joyride

[Verse 3]
She's a flower, I could paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run

Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, whoa no

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause it all begins again when it ends, yeah
And we're all magic friends (magic friends, magic friends)

[Chorus]
She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride."
Join the joyride
She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride."
Be a joyrider, ow

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
I'll take you on a sky ride
I'm feeling like I'm spellbound
The sunshine is a lady
Who rocks you like a baby

[Outro]
She says, "Hello (hello) you fool (you fool) I love you (I love you)
C'mon join the joyride."
Join the joyride

Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride
Join the joyride

Hello, hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon, c'mon join the joyride
Be a joyrider
