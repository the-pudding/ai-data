When I'm with you, I shake inside
My heart's all tangled up, my tongue is tied
It's crazy
Can't walk, can't talk
Can't eat, can't sleep
Oh, I'm in love, oh, I'm in deep 'cause, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
With a kiss, you can strip me defenseless
With a touch, I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa

[Chorus]
I get weak when I look at you
Weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak
I get weak

[Verse 2]
Convincing eyes, persuasive lips
The helpless heart just can't resist their power
You know you've got a hold over me
You know you've got me where I want to be 'cause, lover

Like a wave, you keep pulling me under
How I'll ever get out of this, I don't know
I just know there's just no way to fight it
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa

[Chorus]
I get weak when I look at you
Weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak from this love
I'm in deep when I look in your eyes
I get weak
I get weak
I get weak

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just a kiss, you can strip me defenseless
Just a touch, I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I get weak when I look at you
Weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eye
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eye
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyeEmbed
