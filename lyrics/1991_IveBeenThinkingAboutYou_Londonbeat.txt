10 ContributorsIâ€™ve Been Thinking About You Lyrics[Verse 1]
We must have been stone crazy
When we thought we were just friends
'Cause I miss you, baby
And I've got those feelings again
I guess I'm all confused about you
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

[Verse 2]
Suddenly we're strangers
I watch you walking away
She was my one temptation
Oh, I did not want her to stay
Deep down, I'm still confused about you
(Oh yes I am baby)
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow
You might also like[Bridge]
What good is being here without you? (I wanna know)
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

[Chorus till fade]
(Oh baby, can't get you off my mind)
(Think about you all the time)Embed
