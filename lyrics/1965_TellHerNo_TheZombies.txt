[Pre-Chorus]
And if she should tell you "come closer"
And if she tempts you with her charms

[Chorus]
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me

[Pre-Chorus]
And if she should tell you "I love you" (whoa)
And if she tempts you with her charms

[Chorus]
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
(Don't let her down from your arms)
No no no no no (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me

[Verse]
I know she's the kind of girl
Who'd throw my love away
But I still love her so
Don't hurt me now, don't hurt me now
