6 ContributorsAll I Need Lyrics[Verse 1]
Kissing you was not what I had planned
And now I'm not so sure just where I stand
I wasn't looking for true love
But now you're looking at me
You're the only one I can think of
You're the only one I see

[Chorus]
All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

[Verse 2]
Yes it's true we've all been hurt before
But it doesn't seem to matter anymore
It may be a chance we're taking
But it always comes to this
If this isn't love we're making
Then I don't know what it is

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe
You might also like[Chorus]
All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

[Verse 3]
No stars are out tonight
But we're shining our own light
And it's never felt so bright
Cause girl the way I'm feeling
It's easy to believe
That you're all I need

[Outro]
Ahhhh
You're all I need
Oooooh ahhhh1Embed
