26 ContributorsOne More Try Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm lookin' out for angels
Just tryin' to find some peace

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't, just let me go

[Chorus]
'Cause teacher, there are things
That I don't wanna learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
That look in your eyes
Tellin' me no!
So you think that you love me
And know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go!

[Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I don't wanna learn
Oh, the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go!

[Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have
Is my pride
Oh, so I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just is unwillin' to try
[Outro]
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try7Embed
