5 ContributorsStay Awhile Lyrics[Girl]
Into my room, he creeps
Without making a sound
Into my dreams, he peeps
With his hair all long and hanging down

How he makes me quiver
How he makes me smile
With all this love I have to give you
I guess, I'm gonna stay with him awhile

[Boy]
She brushes the curls from my eyes
She drops her robe on the floor
And she reaches for the light on the bureau
And the darkness is her pillow once more

How she makes me quiver
How she makes me smile
With all this love I have to give her
I guess, I'm gonna stay with her awhile

[Instrumental]

[Duet]
How it makes me quiver
How it makes me smile
With all this love I have to give you
Guess I'm gonna stay with you awhile
You might also likeHow it makes me quiver
How it makes me smile
With all this love I have to give you
Guess I'm gonna stay with you awhile

Stay with you awhile
(whispered) I guess, I'm gonna stay1Embed
