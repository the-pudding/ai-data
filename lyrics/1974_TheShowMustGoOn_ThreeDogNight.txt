7 ContributorsThe Show Must Go On Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Baby), although I chose this lonely life
It seems it's strangling me now
All the wild men, big cigars, gigantic cars
They're all laughing at me now

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been used, ooh, used (ooh used)
I've been a fool, oh, what a fool (oh what a fool)
I broke all the rules, oh, yeah (all the rules)
But I (must let the show go on)

[Verse 2]
(Baby), there's an enormous crowd of people
They're all after my blood
I wish maybe they'd tear down the walls of this theater
Let me out, let me out

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm so blind, oh, I'm blind (oh so blind)
I wasted time, wasted, wasted, wasted time (wasted time)
Walking on a wire, high wire (high high wire)
But I (must let the show go on)

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm so blind, oh, I'm blind (oh so blind)
I wasted time, wasted, wasted all too much time (wasted time)
Walking on a wire, high wire (high high wire)
But I (must let the show go on)

Baby, I wish you'd help me escape
Help me get away
(Hoo ooh) Leave me outside my address (hoo ooh)
Far away from this (hoo ooh) masquerade (hoo ooh)

[Outro]
'Cause I've been blind, oh, so blind
I wasted time, wasted, wasted all too much time
Walking on a wire, high wire
But I (must let the show go)
I (must let the show go)
I (must let the show go on)Embed
