6 ContributorsFight the Power, Pts. 1 & 2 Lyrics[Intro]
Ha! Ooh
Hey, ha!
Ha!

[Verse 1]
Time is truly wastin’, there’s no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin’, we've got to fight the powers that be
Got so many voices, saying all the same, yeah
Killing up all around me, faces full of pain

[Refrain]
I tried to play my music, they say my music’s too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches, I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, hey

[Verse 2]
Time is truly wastin’, there’s no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin’, we got to fight the powers that be
I don’t understand it, people wanna say, yeah
Those that got the answers, red tape in the way
I could tend to it easy, that's just half the fun now, now
Seekin’ my satisfaction keeps me on the run

[Refrain]
I tried to play my music, say my music’s too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches, I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, ooh!
