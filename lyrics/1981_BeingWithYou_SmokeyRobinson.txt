I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

[Verse 1]
Honey don't go, don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture and off of the screen
Don't let them say "we told you so"
They tell me you'll love me and then let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've heard the warning voice
From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

[Chorus]
I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say.. no
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

People can change, they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be, that like love I am blind?
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

[Pre-Chorus]
One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

[Chorus]
I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

[Outro]
Being with you
Being with you
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you
I wanna be with you
I don't care if they start to avoid me1Embed
