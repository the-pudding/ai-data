We've been together for a long time, baby
Do you have to leave?
(Please don't go, girl)
I just can't live without you
(Please)
So listen to me
(Don't go, girl)
Don't go girl

[Chorus]
Please, don't go, girl
You would ruin my whole world
Tell me you'll stay
Never ever go away

[Verse 1]
I love you
(I love you)
I guess I always will
Girl, you're my best friend
Girl, you're my love within
I just want you to know that I will always love you
Ooh, baby, ooh
Tell me you'll stay
Never ever go away
