30 ContributorsI Wanna Be Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
'Cause when I look at you, I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know, then I won't be for real
I could be wrong, but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you, the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me, it's only you (Down)

[Chorus]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down (Down)
I wanna be down with you (Down with you)
No matter the time (Oh)
Of day or night, it's true (Yeah-oh, yeah)
I wanna be down

[Verse 2]
I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact, then I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is my time, that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you want me, baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to cool you out
And let you know everything will be alright

I wanna be down (Down, whoa-ooh yeah)
With what you're going through (Yeah)
I wanna be down (I wanna be down)
I wanna be down with you (With you)
No matter the time (No matter the time)
Of day or night, it's true (Baby)
I wanna be down (Wanna be, got to be down)
I wanna be down
With what you're going through (Oh, oh-yeah)
I wanna be down (I wanna be down)
I wanna be down with you (Ay, I wanna be down)
No matter the time (No matter the time)
Of day or night, it's true (Of day or night, it's true)
I wanna be down (I wanna be down, down, down)

[Bridge]
Down, down, down
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Down, down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
I wanna be down (I wanna be down)
With what you're going through (With only you, my baby)
I wanna be down (I wanna be down)
I wanna be down with you (With only you)
No matter the time (Oh yeah)
Of day or night, it's true
I wanna be down (Wanna be, got to be down)
I wanna be down (I wanna be)
With what you're going through (I got to be)
I wanna be down (I wanna be, yeah)
