39 ContributorsCreep Lyrics[Intro: T-Boz]
Yes
It's me again
And I'm back
Ah-ah, woo

[Refrain: TLC, T-Boz]
(Creep) Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah
(Creep) Oh I, oh I, oh I, ah yeah
(Creep) Oh I oh I, oh I, ah yeah

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
The 22nd of loneliness
And we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheating on me

[Pre-Chorus: T-Boz]
(Creep) I look him in his eyes
But all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

[Chorus: TLC]
So I creep, yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
Oh, so I creep

The 23rd of loneliness
And we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange
But I'm not buggin', 'cause I still feel the same
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: TLC, T-Boz]
(Creep) I'll keep giving loving
'Till the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did (Woo)
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected, oh
