5 ContributorsBecause Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
It's right that I should care about you
And try to make you happy when you're blue
It's right, it's right to feel the way I do
Because, because I love you

[Bridge]
It's wrong to say, "I don't think of you"
'Cause when you say these things
You know it makes me blue

[Verse 2]
Give me one kiss and I'll be happy
Just, just to be with you
Give me, give me a chance to be near you
Because, because I love you

[Organ Solo]

[Verse 3]
Give me one kiss and I'll be happy
Just, just to be with you
Give me, give me a chance to be near you
Because, because I love you

Because, because I love youEmbed
