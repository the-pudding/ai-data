(Ooh!)
Yo, this just one of them jams (Yeah)
You wanna just lay back (Do-dah-do-dah-do, doo-doo)
And just kick it, you know what I'm sayin'? (Doo-dah-doo, yeah)
Yeah, you don't hear me though
Peep this
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Kandi, (LaTocha)]
Every man wants a woman
Where him and her can just go hang
Huh, just the two of them alone, kick back
Doin' their own thing
(They're doin' their own thing, yeah!)
And every man wants a woman
That can always keep him in the mood
And I'm that kind of girl
So, this is what I tell my dude

[Chorus: Xscape, (Kandi)]
(I tell him to) Kick off your shoes and relax your feet (Oh, baby)
Party on down to the Xscape beat, just kick it
Just kick it (Just kick it), just kick it
(I tell him to) Kick off your shoes and relax your feet (Oh, oh)
Party on down to the Xscape beat, just kick it
Just kick it (Just kick it), just kick it

Every man wants a woman
That can cook him up a good meal (Cook him up a good meal)
Huh, a woman he can treat like his homie
Take her out on the Ave and just chill (Just chill)
And every man wants a woman
That ain't good for just layin' on her back
(And I'm that kind of woman)
So, before me and my man get in the sack...

[Chorus: Xscape, (Kandi)]
(I'll tell him to) Kick off your shoes and relax your feet (Kick off your shoes)
Party on down to the Xscape beat, just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it (Oh, oh)
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat, just kick it
Just kick it (Kickin', my baby), just kick it (Yeah, yeah)
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat, just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat, just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
