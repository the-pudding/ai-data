I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me

[Verse]
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd shine up the old brown shoes, I'd put on a brand-new shirt
I'd get home early from work if you say that you love me

[Chorus]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?

[Verse]
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me
