I was blown away
What could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything
And I can't deal with that
I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
We'll blow it away, blow it away

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

[Chorus]
Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

[Verse 2]
I've taken all I could take
And I cannot wait
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on
Can't let it bring us down
My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
I'll blow it away, blow it away

'Cause it's all misunderstood
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

[Chorus]
Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

[Bridge]
We can't let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself
Let it out

[Chorus]
Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over
[Outro]
Let's start over
It's not over, yeah, yeah
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over9Embed
