The butterfly? Uh-uh, that's old, let me see the Tootsee Roll
Yeah, 1990-Quad
69 Boyz backed up by the Quad City DJ's, one time

[Chorus]
Cotton candy, Sweetie Gold, let me see the Tootsee Roll
C'mon, c'mon (Tootsee Roll), just make that Tootsee Roll
Here we go, here we go (Tootsee Roll), just make that Tootsee Roll
Yeah, c'mon (Tootsee Roll), lemme see that Tootsee Roll
Get up and roll (Tootsee Roll) and make that Tootsee Roll

[Post-Chorus]
To the left, to the left, to the right, to the right
To the front, to the front, to the back, to the back
Now slide, slide, baby, slide, just slide, baby
Slide, just slide, baby, slide, c'mon, c'mon (Slide)
To the left, to the left, to the right, to the right
To the front, to the front, to the back, to the back
Now dip, baby, dip, c'mon, let's dip, baby, dip, baby
Dip, baby, dip (Just dip, baby), dip, baby, dip (Just dip, baby)
Cotton candy, Sweetie Gold, let me see the Tootsee Roll

[Verse 1]
I don't know what you've been told
It ain't the butterfly, it's the Tootsee Roll
A brand new dance, so
Grab a partner and get on the dance floor
And work them hips a lil' bit
Then do that dip a lil' bit
Oh yeah, you got it
No ifs, ands or no buts about it
And you over there, with the long hair
Keep rollin' that derriere
'Cause it ain't hard
Just a brand new dance for the 1990-Quad
69 in the place to be
Hey yo, 'Ski, what we came to see?
