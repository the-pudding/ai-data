9 ContributorsG.H.E.T.T.O.U.T. Lyrics[Intro]
Sittin' here, sittin' here
Sittin' here, sittin' here
All alone

[Verse 1: Charisse]
I've been feelin' kinda strange lately
I don't know what's goin' on baby
Ever since I came back from out of town
Something's tellin' me some bullshit is goin' down (Down)

[Pre-Chorus: Changing Faces, Charisse]
Boy, is it someone else you're seekin'? (Is there someone else?)
My vital's tellin' me you're creepin'
Findin' numbers in your jeans
You're talkin' in your sleep
Phantom letters written by me
Ghetto-u-t

[Chorus: Changing Faces]
No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else
No more starin' at the phone
'Cause I can do bad all by myself
Yeah

It's obvious how things have changed within a year (One year)
Just give me half of the rent and get out of here
No more talkin', save your lines for somebody else
Keep on walkin', 'cause I can do bad all by myself

[Pre-Chorus: Changing Faces, Cassandra]
Boy, is it someone else you're seekin'? (Is there someone else?)
My vital's tellin' me you're creepin' (Ooh boy I'm)
I'm findin' numbers in your jeans (Yes)
You're talkin' in your sleep
Phantom letters written by me
Ghetto-u-t

[Chorus: Changing Faces (Charisse, Cassandra)]
No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else (Somebody else)
No more starin' at the phone
'Cause I can do bad all by myself (Bad all by myself)
No more sittin' at home alone (Mmmm)
While you're out with somebody else
(While you're with somebody else)
No more starin' at the phone
'Cause I can do bad all by myself

[Bridge: Charisse, Cassandra, Together]
I gave you all (Ooh)
All of my time
But you would not know a good thing, baby
If it stares you in your face
Boy, is it someone...
[Pre-Chorus: Changing Faces, Cassandra, Charisse]
Boy, is it someone else you're seekin'? (Is there someone else?)
My vital's tellin' me you're creepin'
Findin' numbers in your jeans
You're talkin' in your sleep
Phantom letters written by me
Ghetto-u-t

[Chorus: Changing Faces (Cassandra, Charisse)]
No more sittin' at home alone (No more)
While you're out with somebody else (Somebody else)
No more starin' at the phone
Cause I can do bad all by myself (I can do bad all by myself)
No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else (With somebody else)
No more starin' at the phone (No more, no more.)
Cause I can do bad all by myself (All the ladies sing)

[Breakdown (Through the end)]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, ay, ey, ay
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, ay, ey, ay

[Chorus: Changing Faces]
No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else
No more starin' at the phone
'Cause I can do bad all by myself
No more sittin' at home alone
While you're out with somebody else
No more starin' at the phone
'Cause I can do bad all by myselfEmbed
