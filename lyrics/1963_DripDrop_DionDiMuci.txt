Handful of "Gimme", mouthful of "Thank you, honey"
My mama don't allow me to fool 'round all night long
She said "Son, you may be young, child
Some woman may do you wrong"

She say, all that powder, perfume, and paint
Makes me think you little girls, you are what you ain't
My mama don't allow me to fool 'round all night long
She said "Son, you may be young
Some woman may do you wrong"

Whoah, sweet peaches don't come from the trees
Sweet honey don't, little girl, come from the bees
My mama don't allow me to fool 'round all night long
She said "Son, you may be young
Some woman may do you wrong"

Come on

I laid down last night, tryin' to get my rest
My mind started ramblin' like the wild geese in the west
My mama don't allow me to fool 'round all night long
She said "Son, you may be young
Some woman may do you wrong

They ain't never goin' my way
Two trains runnin'
They ain't never goin' my way
You know, one goin' at midnight
Yeah, the other wait for day

I said, drop down, baby, you strike me kinda funny
You got a handful of "Gimme", mouthful of "Thank you, honey"
My mama don't allow me to fool 'round all night long
She said "Son, you may be young, child
Some woman may do you wrong"Embed
