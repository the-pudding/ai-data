What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive

[Pre-Chorus]
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy 'til you spend a lot of money

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?

[Pre-Chorus]
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental

[Chorus]
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me
See Billy Joel LiveGet tickets as low as $85You might also like[Bridge]
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town but you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

[Verse 3]
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers

[Chorus]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
Alright Richie!

[Saxophone Solo]
Woo!
Ooh
[Verse 4]
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know about the new fashion, honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money

[Chorus]
It's the next phase, new wave
Dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me12Embed
