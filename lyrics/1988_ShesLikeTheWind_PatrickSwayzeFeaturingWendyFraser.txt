She's like the wind
Through my tree
She rides the night next to me
She leads me through moonlight
Only to burn me with the sun
She's taken my heart
But she doesn't know what she's done

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Swayze]
Feel her breath in my face
Her body close to me
Can't look in her eyes
She's out of my league

[Chorus: Patrick Swayze]
Just a fool to believe
I have anything she needs
She's like the wind

[Verse 2: Patrick Swayze]
I look in the mirror
And all I see
Is a young old man with only a dream
Am I just fooling myself
That she'll stop the pain?
Living without her
I'd go insane
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Swayze]
I feel her breath in my face
Her body close to me
Can't look in her eyes
She's out of my league

[Chorus: Patrick Swayze]
Just a fool to believe
I have anything she needs
She's like the wind

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Swayze & Wendy Fraser]
I feel your breath in my face
Your body close to me
Can't look in your eyes
You're out of my league

[Bridge: Patrick Swayze & Wendy Fraser]
Just a fool to believe (Just a fool to believe)
She's like the wind
(Just a fool to believe) Just a fool to believe
(She's like the wind)
Just a fool to believe (Just a fool to believe)
She's like the wind
(Just a fool to believe) Just a fool to believe
She's like the wind
[Outro]
(Just a fool, she's like the wind)
(She's like the wind)
(Just a fool, she's like the wind)
(Just a fool)4Embed
