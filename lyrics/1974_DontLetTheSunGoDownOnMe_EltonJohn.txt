23 ContributorsDonâ€™t Let the Sun Go Down on Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2]
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun)
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life (Don't let the sun) to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Verse 3]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun)
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life (Don't let the sun) to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun)
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life (Don't let the sun) to wander free, yeah
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me4Embed
