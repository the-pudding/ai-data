[Verse 1: Dawn Robinson & En Vogue]
Many say that I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from, yeah
But you will see, it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine

[Pre-Chorus: En Vogue & Dawn Robinson]
Well, I'm livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone seems so uptight
But nothing's wrong and that's alright with my man (My man)
I like the way we carry on
His loving ways send me on and on with my man
People out there can understand

[Chorus: En Vogue & Dawn Robinson]
I'm giving him something he can feel (Ooh)
To let him know this love is real (Hey, oh, I'm...)
Giving him something he can feel (All my lovin')
To let him know this love is real (Oh, my love is real)
This love is real
