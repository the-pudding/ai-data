Young teacher, the subject of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly, knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing, this girl's an open page
Bookmarking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Verse 2]
Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy to be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration so bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting his car is warm and dry

[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Loose talk in the classroom to hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom the accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her he starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in that book by Nabokov

[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh

[Outro]
(Please don't stand so close to me)
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
(Please don't stand so close to me)
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
(Please don't stand so close to me)
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
(Please don't stand so close to me)
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
(Please don't stand so close to me)
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
(Please don't stand so close to me)
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me5Embed
