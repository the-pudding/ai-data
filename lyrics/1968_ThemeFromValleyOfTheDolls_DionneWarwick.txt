10 Contributors(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gotta get off, gonna get
Have to get off from this ride
Gotta get hold, gonna get
Need to get hold of my pride

[Verse 2]
When did I get, where did I
How was I caught in this game?
When will I know, where will I
How will I think of my name?

[Bridge]
When did I stop feeling sure, feeling safe
And start wondering why, wondering why?
Is this a dream? Am I here? Where are you?
What's in back of the sky? Why do we cry?

[Verse 3]
Gotta get off, gonna get
Out of this merry-go-round
Gotta get on, gonna get
Need to get on where I'm bound

[Verse 4]
When did I get, where did I
Why am I lost as a lamb?
When will I know, where will I
How will I learn who I am?

Is this a dream? Am I here? Where are you?
Tell me

[Outro]
When will I know, how will I know
When will I know why?Embed
