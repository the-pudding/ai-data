Ding-dong-ding
Ding-dong-ding

[Verse 1: Burl Ives & Chorus]
Have a holly jolly Christmas (Ding-dong-ding)
It's the best time of the year (Ding-dong-ding)
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas (Ding-dong-ding)
And when you walk down the street (Ding-dong-ding)
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

[Pre-Chorus: Burl Ives, Chorus,  Burl Ives & Chorus]
Oh ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you (Ahh)
Kiss her once for me

[Chorus: Burl Ives & Chorus]
Have a holly jolly Christmas (Ding-dong-ding)
And in case you didn't hear (Ding-dong-ding)
Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

[Interlude: Chorus]
