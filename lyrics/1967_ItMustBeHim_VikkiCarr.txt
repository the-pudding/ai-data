3 ContributorsIt Must Be Him Lyrics[Verse 1]
I tell myself, "What's done is done"
I tell myself, "Don't be a fool"
Play the field, have a lot of fun
It's easy when you play it cool
I tell myself, "Don't be a chump
Who cares? Let him stay away"
That's when the phone rings and I jump
And as I grab the phone I pray

[Chorus]
Let it please be him, oh, dear God
It must be him, it must be him
Or I shall die, or I shall die
Oh, hello, hello, my dear God
It must be him, but it's not him
And then I die, that's when I die

[Verse 2]
After a while, I'm myself again
I pick the pieces off the floor
Put my heart on the shelf again
You'll never hurt me anymore
I'm not a puppet on a string
I'll find somebody else someday
That's when the phone rings
And once again, I start to pray
You might also like[Chorus]
Let it please be him, oh, dear God
It must be him, it must be him
Or I shall die, or I shall die
Oh, hello, hello, my dear God
It must be him, but it's not him
And then I die, again I die

[Outro]
Let it please be him, oh, dear God
It must be him, it must be him
Or I shall die, or I shall die1Embed
