We fell in love as the leaves turn brown

Lupe Fiasco:

Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a **** star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
There's a time that I remember when I did not know no pain

Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

*****es hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a **** about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, "**** it"
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt ***** somewhere, get my **** kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
*****es on my **** that used to brush me off in high school
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump ****
Look at all this money! Ain't that some ****?

Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies
I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you mother****ers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap ****
Can a single one of you mother****ers even rap? ****

Meek Mill:

Eminem:
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you

How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

Eminem:

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow

She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know

Eminem:

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problems complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
**** that, *** on your lips and some on your ***

Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you ****** is hatin'
Shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you ******* is losers, all my ****** is winnin', screamin'—
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my **** get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can **** the world for seventy-two hours

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower

Rihanna (Again):

They wanna smell like me, they want my bouquet

My perfume pursued them everywhere that they went
You don't want a loan, leave my cologne alone
It's a little too strong for you to be putting on
Trust me

Kanye West:

The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, mother****er, we rolling
Huh? Mother****er, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, **** that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

Logic:

Uh, death and taxes that’s all we given
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'
You could make it work, but that still ain't driven
Give a lot, but that still ain't givin'
Livin' life like this ain’t real though
Every night like this, I feel so
Dead wrong, collision is
Head-on, my vision is
Dead and gone
, perception of
Right and wrong, I been here so
Very long right here in this
Very song, uh
Look around, everything changes
Seem like everybody just strangers
Don’t go outside 'cause it’s dangerous
Why everybody wanna be famous?
I’m so OCD if they notice me
I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me
Man, everybody want this **** for free
Hand out, palm up when they get to me
In my mind, no, I never let it get to me
Everybody got a turn, will it get to me?
V’s up mother****er, that’s victory
Tell me why what I’m doin' ain’t **** to me, ****

You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a ******, I be a ******
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this ****

Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?

Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype ***

Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking
This here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T ****, hustlin'

Jetta:

Neffex:
You're never gonna make it, you're not good enough
There's a million other people with the same stuff
You really think you're different? Man, you must be kiddin'
Think you're gonna hit it, but you just don't get it
It's impossible, it's not probable
You're irresponsible, too many obstacles
You gotta stop it, yo, you gotta take it slow
You can't be a pro, don't waste your time no more
Who the **** are you to tell me what to do?
I don't give a **** if you say you disapprove
I'm gonna make my move, I'm gonna make it soon
And I'll do it 'cause it's what I want to ****ing do
'Cause all these opinions and all these positions
They're coming in millions, they're blocking your vision
But no, you can't listen, that **** is all fiction
'Cause you hold the power as long as you're driven
You're never gonna make it
There's no way that you make it
Yeah, maybe you can fake it
But you're never gonna make it
Are you just gonna take that?
Make 'em take it all back
Don't tell me you believe that
Are you just gonna take that?
Or will you ****king fight back?
Or will you ****ing fight back?
You ain't gonna make it, you ain't never ever gonna break it
You can never beat 'em, man, they're better than you, face it
Thinking that they give a ****, you're not thinking straight kid
Nah, they don't give a ****, you got what I'm sayin'?
I'm not ****ing playin', I'll give it to you straight, man
There's too many others and you're not that great, man
Stop what you're sayin', stop what you're makin'
Everybody here knows that you're just fakin'
Nah, I don't wanna hear it anymore
I don't wanna hear it anymore
All these ****ing thoughts, they are not what I need anymore
I'm about to shut the mother****ing door
On all you poor *** haters with your heads in the clouds
Talkin' out loud, so proud
You better shut your god**** mouths
Before I do more than speak out, it's about to head south
You're never gonna make it
There's no way that you make it
Yeah, maybe you can fake it
But you're never gonna make it
Are you just gonna take that?

Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high-rise
I hide behind my shades cause the fame is blinding my eyes
My God, I know how Ozzie Oz
Once had felt when he was as high as I have got
I have got to make this stop
People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
It'll change those who said they had love for you into strangers
When your fame starts, it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when the train departs
Stranger, things have happened

Eminem:

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta *****' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their ****in' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway

Neiked:

Do you remember last night? 'Cause I blacked out
In that all white dress with her back out
Said be careful with her heart 'cause it's fragile
And thinkin' 'bout her past make her lash out
See, with me, it ain't no worries at all
Any problem, I'll be there, one call
If we locked in, you my dawg
Fan of you, I hang pictures on my wall

Kanye West:

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight

I ask, 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real **** anymore?

Neiked:

Livin' in a haze, stayin' in the shade

Prinz:

Lord I thank you for sunshine Let me-
Let me paint you a picture, wake up I step out of bed
As I'm reading the holy scripture, I tell my mum I'll make her proud

And I have no doubt in my mind like MJ, I follow that man in the mirror

So I'm thankful for the roof I have I'm thankful for my lunch and dinner

Taylor Swift:

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend

Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

I'm going to make it bend and break

Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll...)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?" If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys...
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so
Great
"He tastes like you, only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter"

Youngboy NBA:

I said right foot creep, ooh, I'm walking with that heater
Look around, stay low, make sure they don't see you
Catch 'em bad, walk down, face 'em with that heater

Eminem:

Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your mother****in' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a **** dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
**** that, do that ****, shoot that ****
Can you afford to blow this ****? Are you that rich?
Why you give a **** if she dies? Are you that ****?
Do you really think she gives a **** if you have kids?

Bow! Get the **** though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho

Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate

And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She ****in' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!
