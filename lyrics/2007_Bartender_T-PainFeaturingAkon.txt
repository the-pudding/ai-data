45 ContributorsBartender Lyrics[Intro: T-Pain]
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Broke up with my girl last night so I went to the club (So I went to the club)
Put on a fresh white suit and the mini-coupe sittin' on dubs (Sittin' on dubs)
I'm just lookin' for somebody to talk to and show me some love (Show me some love)
If you know what I mean, uh-huh
Everybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)
Two hundred bitches in the building, ain't none of them hot (Ain't none of them hot)
Except for this pretty young thang that was workin' all the way at the top (On the way, at the top)
Shawty, what is your name?

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Ooh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk
And I think she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We hit it off somethin' proper like

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)
I'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)
I like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)
I'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)
See T-Pain LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also like[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Got a brand new girl so I'm feelin' all good inside (All good inside)
Feel like I put some brand new twenty-fours on a brand new ride (On a brand new ride)
Triple shot of Patron on the rocks with a little bit of lime (With a little bit of lime)
I'm just keepin' it real, uh-huh
Baby still workin' at the club so I'm gettin' in free (So I'm gettin' in free)
Wednesday night, I'm on the list, T-Pain plus three (T-Pain plus three)
Every time I hit the spot babygirl takin' care of me (Takin' care of me)
How do you think I feel?

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Ooh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk
And now I know she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We gon' have fun at my spot tonight

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)
I'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)
I like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)
I'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)

[Verse 3: Akon & T-Pain]
Shorty, I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out (Ever come out)
'Less I'm in the M6, doin' tricks, freeway burnt out (Freeway burnt out)
Got a passenger side that's empty wantin' it to be your spot (Be your spot)
Put you on my Billboard, we can act like the charts, I can end up on top (And I end up on top)
Don't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby (Baby)
Just lookin' at you from a distance, lookin' like a goddamn star baby (Baby)
So my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car? (Those keys to the car)
'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorrow (I'll see you tomorrow)
[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain & Akon]
Ooh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk
And now I know, she thinks I'm cool (She thinks I'm cool)
She gave me a wink, I winked back (Uh-huh)
And then I think that (Uh-huh)
We gon' have fun at my spot tonight (Oh, yeah, slide)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)
I'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)
I like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)
I'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)16Embed
