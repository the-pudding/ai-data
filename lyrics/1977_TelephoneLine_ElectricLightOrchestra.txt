40 ContributorsTelephone Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello, how are you?
Have you been alright
Through all those lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights?
That's what I'd say
I'd tell you everything
If you'd pick up that telephone
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hey, how you feelin'?
Are you still the same?
Don't you realise the things we did, we did
Were all for real, not a dream?
I just can't believe
They've all faded out of view
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Doo-wop, doo-be-doo-doo-wop, doo-wah, doo-lang
Blue days, black nights, doo-wah, doo-lang
I look into the sky
(The love you need ain't gonna see you through)
And I wonder why
(The little things you planned ain't coming true)

Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
I'm living in twilight
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
I'm living in twilight

[Verse 3]
Okay, so no one's answering
Well, can't you just let it ring a little longer, longer, longer? Oh
I'll just sit tight
Through shadows of the night
Let it ring forevermore, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Doo-wop, doo-be-doo-doo-wop, doo-wah, doo-lang
Blue days, black nights, doo-wah, doo-lang
I look into the sky
(The love you need ain't gonna see you through)
And I wonder why
(The little things you planned ain't coming true)

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
I'm living in twilight
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
I'm living in twilight
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
I'm living in twilight
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
I'm living in twilight7Embed
