Runnin' around with your cheap talk
Cheap talk, yeah
What I need is a man who can do me right
Do me right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you got what I need, I can guarantee
To return all the love that you've given to me
But I've got to be sure that you'll always will be around
(Always be around)

Do you know what it takes to love me?
Do you know what it takes to do me right?
Do you know what it takes to love me?
Baby, baby

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows in my time, I've been lonely
Feeling my love echo in my mind, in my mind, yeah
A never satisfied girl's what they call me
But I just can't keep goin' on living lies
