16 ContributorsCase of the Ex (Whatcha Gonna Do) Lyrics[Intro: Tricky]
Yeah, Mýa
RedZone, what, what?
Uh

[Verse 1]
It's after midnight and she's on your phone (Phone)
Saying, "Come over," 'cause she's all alone ('Lone)
I could tell it was your ex by your tone (Tone)
Why is she callin' now after so long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now what is it that she wants?
Tell me, what is it that she needs?
Did she hear about the brand new Benz
That you just bought for me?
'Cause y'all didn't have no kids
Didn't share no mutual friends
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in '96
[Chorus]
Whatcha gon' do when you can't say no?
When the feelings start to show, boy, I really need to know and
How you gonna act? How you gonna handle that?
Whatcha gon' do when she wants you back?
Whatcha gon' do when you can't say no?
When the feelings start to show, boy, I really need to know and
How you gonna act? How you gonna handle that?
Whatcha gon' do when she wants you back?
