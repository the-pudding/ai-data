9 ContributorsDon’t Think Twice, It’s All Right Lyrics[Verse 1]
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travelin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 2]
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there were somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 3]
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a word, gal
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could've done better but I don't mind
You just sorta wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
You might also like[Verse 4]
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never did before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right1Embed
