8 ContributorsMy Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been through so many changes in my life woman
It's a wonder I ain't lost my mind
And I ain't never said how much I need you sugar
But I sure need you by my side

[Chorus]
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind all the time

[Verse 2]
Life with me I know for sure it ain't been easy
But you stayed with me anyway
And even though you ain't gonna lose too much by leaving
I'm so glad you stayed

[Chorus]
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind all the time

[Verse 3]
You've been my friend and you've been my lover, oh lord
Honey you're everything I need
You've made my love so strong now I know where I belong
Oh girl you'll never have to worry

My love, (My love) just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind (Oh yeah)
My love, just thinking about you baby
Just blows my mind all the time
Oh yeahEmbed
