Oh, baby, sweet baby
What am I gonna do, yeah, yeah
Baby, sweet baby, my babe
What am I gonna do with you, yeah

Been makin' love for hours
And, baby, with you goin' strong
Girl, this night is ours
And, ooh, I swear I feel it comin' on, yeah

Oh, I know when we get through
Girl, I won't be able to move
I don't know just what you got
I just don't want you to stop
Givin' me, all of me

You are unwillin', you're just to much
You know how to make me “Ow”
