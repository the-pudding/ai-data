Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you were
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before

[Verse 1]
If you are confused, check with the sun
Carry a compass to help you along
Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around

[Chorus]
So stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you were
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before

Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around
If wishes were trees, the trees would be falling
Listen to reason, the season is calling

[Chorus]
Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you were
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before

[Verse 3]
If wishes were trees, the trees would be falling
Listen to reason, reason is calling
Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around

[Bridge]
So stand (Stand!)
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand (Stand!)
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't
[Chorus]
Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you were
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before
