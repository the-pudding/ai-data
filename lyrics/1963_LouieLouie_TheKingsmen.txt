Louie Louie, oh no, you take me where ya gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Louie Louie, oh baby, take me where ya gotta go

A fine little girl, she waits for me
Me catch the ship across the sea
Me sailed that ship all alone
Me never think I'll make it home

Louie Louie, oh no no no, we gotta go
Oh no
Said Louie Louie, oh baby, me gotta go

Fuck!

Three nights and days I sailed the sea
Me think of girl constantly
On that ship, I dream she there
I smell the rose in her hair

Louie Louie, oh no, me gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Louie Louie, oh baby, said we gotta go
Okay, let's give it to 'em right now

Me see Jamaica, the moon above
It won't be long me see me love
Me take her in my arms and then
I tell her I'll never leave again
Louie Louie, oh no, we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Louie Louie, oh baby, said we gotta go
I said we gotta go now
Let's hustle on out of here
Let's go9Embed
