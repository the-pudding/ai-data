11 ContributorsNever My Love Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never, my love
Never, my love

[Verse 2]
You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never, my love
Never, my love

[Bridge 1]
What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you? (On you)

[Verse 3]
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Never, my love
Never, my love

[Verse 4]
You say you fear I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never, my love (Never, my love)
Never, my love (Never, my love)

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life

Never, my love (Never, my love)
