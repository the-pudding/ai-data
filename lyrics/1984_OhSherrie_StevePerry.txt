You should've been gone
Knowing how I made you feel
And I should've been gone
After all your words of steel

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I must have been a dreamer
(Must have been a dreamer I know)
And I must've been someone else
(Someone else)
And we should've been over
(Over now)

[Chorus]
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)

[Verse 2]
But I want to let go
You'll go on hurtin' me
You'd be better off alone
If I'm not who you thought I'd be
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But you know that there's a fever
(There's a fever I know)
That you'll never find nowhere else
(Nowhere, nowhere else)
Can't you feel it burnin' on and on

[Chorus]
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
Oh Sherrie

[Bridge]
But I should've been gone
Long ago, far away
And you should've been gone
Now, I know you'd lie you stay

[Chorus]
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
[Chorus]
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
(Oh Sherrie, our love Sherrie, Sherrie)
Hold on, oh Sherrie5Embed
