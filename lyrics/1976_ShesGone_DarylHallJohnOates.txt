Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me what is right for me, yeah
My daddy tried to bore me with a sermon
But it's plain to see that they can't comfort me

Sorry, Charlie, for the imposition
I think I got it (Got it), I got the strength to carry on, oh yeah
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, ooh, what will be

[Chorus]
She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh why, what went wrong?

[Verse 2]
Get up in the morning, look in the mirror
One less toothbrush hanging in the stand, yeah
My face ain't looking any younger
Now I can see love's taken a toll on me
You might also like[Chorus]
She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh why, what went wrong?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Think I'll spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away, yeah
And pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
They can never be what she was (Was) to (To) me

[Chorus]
She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, what went wrong?
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus Outro]
She's gone
Oh I, I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
I can't believe that she's gone
Oh I, I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone
Oh I, I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
I can't believe that she's gone
Oh I, I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone...1Embed
