I came to dance, dance, dance, dance (Yeah)
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans (Yeah)
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands (Yeah)
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on, yeah

[Chorus]
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Sayin' "Ayo, gotta let go"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Sayin' "Ayo, baby, let's go"

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once
Now I told you twice
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite
