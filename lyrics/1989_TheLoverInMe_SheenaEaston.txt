7 ContributorsThe Lover in Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Talk about the love you're missing
Maybe then it's true when they say love is blind
I can help you if you listen
I can make you feel good if you just let me try

[Pre-Chorus]
If everlasting love is what you're waiting for
Then that time for you, it just has arrived
So here I am, come walk right through my door
And be loved for the rest of your life

[Chorus]
If you talk about good loving
Let's talk about the lover in me (shoo-doo-wop)
So don't go talk about no other
Just talk about the lover in me (shoo-doo-wop)

[Verse 2]
I can give you all the loving
But I gotta know that you're there to receive
I can be your only woman
But I gotta feel that I'm all that you need

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your everything and I can give you so much more
And I'll never leave you lonely at night
So here I am, come walk right through my door
And be loved for the rest of your life

If you talk about and dream about
And think about your lover
Don't talk about or dream about
Or think about no other

Don't run around all over town
Searching for some other
The love we found won't let us down
Let's talk about the lover
