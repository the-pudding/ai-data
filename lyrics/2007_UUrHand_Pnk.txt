31 ContributorsU + Ur Hand Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-uh-uh-uh, ah, uh-uh, ah, oh
Uh-uh-uh-uh, ah, uh-uh, ah, oh

[Verse 1]
Check it out, goin' out on the late night
Lookin' tight, feelin' nice, it's a cock fight
I can tell, I just know, that it's going down
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
At the door, we don't wait 'cause we know them
At the bar, six shots just beginnin'
That's when dickhead put his hands on me
But you see

[Chorus]
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Uh-uh-uh-uh, ah, uh-uh, ah, oh
Uh-uh-uh-uh, ah, uh-uh, ah, oh

[Verse 2]
Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
Wanna dance by myself, guess you're outta luck
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one
A-buh-bye

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Listen up; it's just not happening
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
Just let me have my fun tonight
Aight

[Chorus]
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-uh-uh-uh, ah, uh-uh, ah, oh
Uh-uh-uh-uh, ah, uh-uh, ah, oh
Break-break-break-break-break it down (Oh)

[Bridge]
You're in the corner with your boys; you bet 'em five bucks
You'd get the girl that just walked in, but she thinks you suck
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
So quit spilling your drinks on me, yeah

[Interlude]
You know who you are
High fivin', talking shit, but you're goin' home alone, aren't ya?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment (No)
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second (Just stop and take a second)
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over (Know it's over)
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight (It's just you and your hand)
I'm not here for your entertainment (No, no, no)
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second (Just take a second)
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight (Yeah, oh-oh)10Embed
