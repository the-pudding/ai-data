Everybody loves a clown, so why don't you?
Everybody laughs at the things that I say and do
They all laugh when they see me comin'
But you don't laugh; you just go home runnin'
Everybody loves a clown, so why can't you?
A clown has feelings too

[Verse 2]
I joke around at a party when you are there
But you don't laugh, you don't look; you just don't care
If you wonder why this clown is cryin'
Look a little closer; inside I'm dyin'
It's not easy to be in love, you see
When you're a clown like me'

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to say that I love you
'Cause you would smile and say, "Tell a joke or two"
Yes, I'm a clown, but I don't want to be
Why can't you see the other side of me?
Guess I'll be the guy who plays the part
Of a clown with a broken heart
You might also like[Outro]
Dreaming of your love, and not knowin' where to start
Dreaming of your love, and not knowin' where to start
Dreaming of your love, and not knowin' where to start
Dreaming of your love, and not knowin' where to startEmbed
