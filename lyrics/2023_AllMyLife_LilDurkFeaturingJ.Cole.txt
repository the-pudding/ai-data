Durkio told me he been on some positive shit, yeah, yeah
Lately, I just wanna show up and body some shit, yeah, yeah
Always been a lil' mathematician, lately, it's cash I'm gettin'
Got me losin' count of these bags, I've been movin' too fast
Hard times don't last, 'member when cops harassed
Talkin' out my ass, boy, you ain't shit but a bitch with a badge

[Chorus: Choir & Lil Durk]
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
All this time (All this time)
Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break mе (No, no)
They couldn't take me, thеy couldn't take me (No)
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I decided I had to finish
But the media called me a menace
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image
You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (No, no, no)
I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still unemployed
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See, how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt theyself
Stop tryna take drugs, I refer to myself
Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but

All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
All this time (All this time)
Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me (No, no)
They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me (No)
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down, yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', "Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb"
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age
[Chorus: Choir & Lil Durk]
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
All this time (All this time)
Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me (No, no)
They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me (No)
All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)10Embed
