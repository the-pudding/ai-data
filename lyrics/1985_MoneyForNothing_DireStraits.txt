I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV

[Drum Solo]

[Verse 1: Mark Knopfler, Mark Knopfler & Sting]
Hah, now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothing and your chicks for free
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

[Chorus: Mark Knopfler & Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

[Verse 2: Mark Knopfler]
See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup?
Yeah buddy, that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot, he's a millionaire
See Dire Straits LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also like[Chorus: Mark Knopfler & Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

[Interlude: Mark Knopfler]
Move-ah, move-ah, huh
Chorus: Sting, Mark Knopfler & Sting
Got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
He's gotta move these refrigerators
Got to move these colour TVs
Look-ee here, look at it

[Verse 3: Mark Knopfler, Mark Knopfler & Sting]
I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it sticking in the cameraman
Man, we could have some
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
He's banging on the bongos like a chimpanzee
Oh, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothing, get your chicks for free
[Chorus: Mark Knopfler & Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

[Interlude]
*dog barking*

[Verse 4: Mark Knopfler, Mark Knopfler & Sting]
Listen here, now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothing, and your chicks for free

[Refrain: Mark Knopfler & Sting, Sting, Mark Knopfler]
