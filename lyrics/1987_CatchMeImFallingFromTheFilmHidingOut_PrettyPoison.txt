Better get ready for the lyrical serenade, the son of the devil made
Bringing the people some of the dopest shit that was ever made
Dedicated to rippin the track I do this shit everyday
And it's a fact that me being whack is something they could never say
I'm puffin that everglade, thugging while I'm reppin, grippin the weapon hopin to come up I'm just lookin for better days
Chasin cheddar so tell em I'm goin harder than ever taking this shit to another level this chopper's about to elevate!
I get the melody chop it and show the vet in me
Peep the pedigree let it be known I'm an animal when I be kickin the flow
I hop on the record and then imma wreck it a nigga be doing the most
Better believe it I'm with it I'm finna be one of the realest who did it for sure
Hop on the rhythm I'm killin em slow
When I hear the beat I proceed to immediately bringin the heat Im a genius hard to see me when I'm easily a beast on the feature unique on top of the raw technique its like a secret ingredient
I'm a beast finna sink my teeth in a weakling and leave em leaking I'll creep on them niggas squeezing the eagle and leave em sleeping
Thugging it inhaling reefa capisce and I been a heathen complete with the millimeter compete and you'll be defeated
See me I'm a demon in human form when I do perform
Nothing but the best I rip out the bong feel it in my lungs
Bossing up on em stacking my ones saucing Louboutins
All of your songs is known to flop you like the new LeBron
Straight from the slums we stacking and flipping nigga we on the grind
Gold diggers give em the boner just cuz I'm bonafide
Then I'll be kickin a rhyme
All of my enemies hating my flow design cuz I'm bout to blow like exploding mines or a loaded nine
Bringing this shit with Sprite and the realest choppers from underground
Bringin you the ocho never wit a slow flow lyrics by the boatload once again the stars have aligned and
Brought you the illest niggas out here with the chopper style

Is this what you want bitch
You know I sever people and use it to catch some catfish
Devil said I'm evil baptized in the blood of baptist
Who sicker when they rock it I chop it Lorena bobbit
When I gotta get deposits I pop it and pick your pocket
Leavin em buried assassinated in the cemetery
I'll punch a whole thru ya chest and pull ya heart out by ya capillaries
Say my name in the mirror and I will murder shit like Bloody Mary
I'm coocoo in the noodle manuever shoot up ya house
I'll screw her in the culo put voodoo inside ya spouse
I'm puttin all these rappers to sleep and they call me sandman
I'm cuttin all these bodies in pieces like I'm a madman
Lyrically murder men until they feel it in the physical
Tearin apart a man but first I'm cuttin off his testicles
You fuckin around with a criminal that'll do the crime and turn invisible
Suffering succotash I'm on yo ass flow despicable
Sick in da brain when I cock it and aim I'm takin prisoners of war like im Saddam Hussein
I'll turn the scene to armageddon when I get into range
I'll put a flame to ya skull like its Nicholas Cage
Ain't nowhere to run when I be comin down ya chimney
Ill aim a tommy gun and leave you dead in Little Italy
My military will bring the pain like Kathy Bates in Misery
The stain thats left behind thats on my blade will be your memory
Feed you to the lions if you step into my habitat
Bringin the pain, killin the game tell me can you handle that
Flippin the cane sippin the lean Ill kill you in this title match
These Idol Hands will put that ass to sleep like poppin vikadin
When I find you, you gon' get that ass beatin so take it like a man playing with these weapons of mass destruction like Ironman
Strike a match and leave yo ass burnin inside a pumpkin patch
Fuck a bitch, now you gonna find out who ya uncle is
[Verse 3: Fluenci]
Swamp house bitch i'm coming better than a lettermen
I hit em with the lyrical Assad on my medicine
And damage atoms with the lyrics sad it ain't no competition ruin everything and i seeing blury like it's tunnel vision
Facing demons they can never catch me going through a mission never end up slippin
You ain't fucking with no transmission
Mind blurped and it's absurd to me
Obscure pay the price first and i'm at them like what's worse
Shit it happens everyday I mean I try to let it be
But there is just no other way I mean
The reason that I do it's for the people who don't play
I'm making room for indecision like I found another way
And letting demons get the best of me my time will soon astray
I got a heart I need to fill with love but way too many play
I done bent over backwards tryna make the hate decay
But I'm feinin for an afterlife while dealing with this pain

[Verse 4: McDread]
Spookin em with the dark and evil oujia shit
Gonna eat this shit, up imma haunt your speaker
Summon me up make a scene of it
Jumanji, bet you get your mommy
Seal em in the concrete, dump em in the swamp sea
Monster, whenever they run up, I get em on phonetical wonderment
Make fun it, but imma burn it up and turn it up like the sun and shit
I'm on one, who be thinking they can win against a ghost? So sinister
The host
To- nobody but imma hit em with the malevolance and bevel heads
Then get em with sentiments evil, like kenevil, see your timidness
You's a bitch, should get him a snickers, plea the fifth
Had better believe it I'm credible, and incredibly undeafeted fists
Are raised at ya, got rabies bruh
From livin undagroun' hope it phases ya
Box, cutter up in your mother just for fuckin entertain'in
Anyone anticipatin' obliteratin' my patience
Actimenophen bringin the best, get em adreniline man I'm a fan
Plenty of butter for anyone want it wit somebody
Fill em up man I get into the kitchen
Bringing the shit again, better believe it, I'm dope
Oh, and I guess I flow
A little like a fiddle in the hands of a devil wittle
Away at your soul, like I'm runnin' up with a chisel
Man, imma come up from the swamp, ya
You can feel the bump, sand
Quicker than the gump man
Listen, to my E.V.P
Trynna get attention but you never see me
But I been up in the screens
I know you felt waves, know you heard screams
I know you seen a face, it was me
Be very cautious, walkin' in the hallways
I am sharper than carpet, made of metal saw blades
You will leave a trail of blood, vanish in the smoke boy!
POW!
Spookin 'em all again, whenever they bet it
I jump up in it, get the adrenilene
I stick it up in em, I hit em with chemical virus
Stuff it up into their sinus
Giving no fuck about your finest lines
You ain't the tightest with the rhymes
And I can easily devise hits
That will make your mind split
I won't optimise this, I just need my vices
You can get defeated, don't you ever fuckin try this
Underground we chop it up from ligamint to eyelids
[Verse 5: SnakeLucci]
Give me the K to spray I paved the way
I'm killin em with the wave today I slay this lane
You changed, I stayed the same
Can't delay, can't delay the play, state the claim, N.W.A. today
Did 8 day for day state to state face to face with hate
Race relate chase the plate like it was a race who ate
Fuck a fake debate Draco Snake
Give me the bong ima be lazy off a 8th of hay
Give the fans I'm hot I'm a be a cancer spot
So fly I'm feelin like an astronaut
No drive bys pullin up flash the Glock
Doing it til the casket drops
No one else fast as hot
Whether I'm masked or not I'm psycho
Laugh til you get popped with the rifle I have to snipe you
Dreamer got the shotty downer got the thottys Downer put in "jale" I'm in Nebraska flight school
Ain't no sex case or rainbow colorful hair hit six states and niggas fuck with me there
Throw the fin or the rakes and my Diamonds still in the air
This the Undaground Choppers I pick apart and repair
Your visions more like a dare you livin life in despair
There's so many levels and I'm takin flights of stairs
No life is fair, fights are rare, flights in the air
Life affairs, give me the mic I'm there

[Verse 6: Sinizter]
Slaughter, I’m murdering everything moving
I pray you don’t think this another illusion
Go call on your god while pick up this chopper
And chop till the top of ya body, stop moving
Fuck the intermission,  all these bullets flying at you, you gon’
Think you seein’ double vision, pistols double fisted
All you hear is bucka-bucka from a distance fuckin up the
Engine
Then it stall, go get ya men involved, I pull a combat knife
And get to rippin’ skulls, you know I been to war
So why you wanna push me to the point of flippin’ till
I skin ya like hog, while you hanging from a tree
But ain’t no rope around ya neck, I got you pussies hanging by ya knees
As long as I’m alive and walkin’ on this earth
I promise none of y’all gon’ ever rest in peace!

[Verse 7: SplytSecond]
Here we go once again for the 8th time
Murdering syllables to the bass line
Wondering when we're gonna create nine
Tell me how long do they gotta wait sprite
All of the people that ever doubted my status in the underground but nobody can debate mine
Rapping at em is a hate crime
So I cut em off of the hip so that we don't waste time

Now let's talk about my sexual prowess
It's technical violence
The way that I beat up the kitty
Is something that the vets will go wild with
And'll leave it spasming like it touch an electrical appliance
Grab an umbrella now get ready for you to weather the storm
And I wrote up a rap and then imma gas it better than ever before, When I do in that particular fashion I prevented the mourn
Of Sprite when the beat is killed the moment instrumental is born

Breaking a bat over they back Imma need another bat
You done been defeated with no way to run it back
Babbling upon the track but I deliver none of that
Imma give em lyricism quicker than a runnin back
The wave of the day and the state of the game is in straight disarray when it’s tellin me cover up my tongue in crack
Spit it like an idiot and maybe get a hundred rack s
"you should do the mumble rap" what would be the fun in that

Verbally iconic sensei that is sinister
Drunk on the gin and tonic or spitting fluency you could pick
Gamma’s and omegas in your DNA forcing me to get in to chopping and crucify them all on a Crucifix.
Splyt’ll make an MC dread his own existence
Exhibiting the stamina to go the distance
The moment he flows is a golden instant
Got the skeleton key if you got a bone to pick with me

[Verse 8: Tonik]
I’m coming in stompin
Dropping a couple of bombs
Makin it rain upon
Anybody that don’t really wanna see me on top
When I’m choppin
I’m blockin the pop
But I’m rockin the shots
With no Glock
Cuz I got me an automatic tongue (spray)
I’m gonna cook a hater on the grill up on the microphone because I got it sizzlin
Above a little bit
After I’m fixing to pull the trigger like a crooked pig is
I’m on a mission for killin, I get it done
Somebody comin to give me a beat, you better believe I’ll wreck it
I rub it in whenever somebody gets defeated, better get to steppin
Otherwise I'ma teach a lesson
With a lethal weapon
I’ll become the professor
Then I'ma test you, gonna need a blessing
Cuz I’m flexing when I’m gunning
Check it when I’m runnin
Heavy with the weapon hear me coming
Deaf, I leave you stunned man
Let me catch a breath then I’m gonna get back to the action
I’m attacking, automatic with the weapon I’m packin, I stay strapped

[Verse 9: DNA Tru Lyricist]
I wasn't on Undaground Choppers 1 or Undaground Choppers 7 but add em together and that’s 8
Now I’m back for the rape of the ones who tried to hate
Tried to say they didn't miss me
Bitch please you can take all that shit to the bank and cash it in quickly
A circular saw bladed Frisbee’s
Coming to hit you in the face get ya laced with a lyrical taste
Of one of the greats, someone debates suffer the fate
Sucking and biting em all with the Wreckronomican flow
I make these motherfuckers realize I am the G.O.A.T of UC
When I flow, I'm to kill these guys with the lethal flame you breath? No I breath plus I be
Done with all the dumb shit make amends and kill a beef
Holler out to K-Fix man I hope we keep the peace
Yo we gotta hit em all up with the Nightbreed
Swinging a blade slicing through the air like a Nike
They saw me lay the body on the counter
It wasn’t me but then again it might be
Behind me my bike be a 1400 lightspeed
Just like when I be spitting it at lightspeed
Where’s Double S with the Godspeed we're the ones so godly
Don’t mind us were probably probing ya hardly
Dunkin' ya head in a potty the sign of this grotesque
It’s probably gonna cause a protest oh shit
I’m sorry but I’m the one branding the official T.R.U. on these hoes chest
I'm Brandon Lee in The Crow's nest
Scoping with the flow coasting like a locus don't notice
Halloween it won’t be no hocus pocus jokers right out of me pounding
See me give zero fucks about my speed or how may bars that I spit on these tracks
Slash ya motherfucking neck open let go
And let the blood spew like leftover watery lasagna
Not even the Geico gecko could help ya family with the finances I’m Manson
When it comes to the cult of the lyrical followers calling em like high hands in the air
But bomb em and make em fear like Eminem’s saying fuck Trump B.E.T
And I agree, send trump another lyrical D.D.T

[Verse 10: VBL]
How you gonna keep up with the sonic? tails!
Flying by you so fast I got a comet tail drinking a bottled ale
I’m a villain like Gargamel
Got em all nervous
Hiding up under the bed and biting nails
My style is fresh never stale
I don’t horse around you will get impaled
Then I’ll run around in circles
Holding you like you were riding on a carousel
You're fairly welcome to step to me if you dare to fail
The elder god VBL
I'm a force to be reckoned with
Cause the power is mine
And I'm coming for you like the reaper
So I doubt you can hide
Man this is my method but I really got it down to a science
How many times I gotta remind em on the mic I'm a titan
You think you're higher up till I crucify ya like a Messiah
You're fragile and sensitive like a vagina
I'll grab you by the throat and choke you
Turn your Adam’s apple to apple cider

Verse 11: [Ikonik]
Ich nehme die Gun und zerficke die Penner mit einer motherfucking Bullet, denn ich bin ein legendärer King in dem Business
Kille die wannabe Gees
Nehme die Gun und zersieb die Emcees, denn ich bringe dadurch den Profit von der Street
Jeder Motherfucker denkt er wäre der Beste, doch wenn ich dann vorbeikomme dann werden Leben zerfetzt
Du bist ein hatender Fag und deine Pussylippen sind so dick, dass jeder Pisser weiß, dass du auf Gaypornos fappst
Komm in deine City, gebe keinen Fick auf jämmerliche Bullen die mich killen wollen
Motherfucker besser geh bei Seite
Wenn der Don in deinem Block erscheint, dann rennen alle weg oder ich ziele und zersiebe deren Bodies mit der abgesägten Pumpgun
Demolier die ganze Stadt Mann
Genozid mit der Gun, Son, was dann?
Kille die Pussy mit Headshot
Zerficke die Pisser mit AIDS
Keiner kann euch retten - da kommt jede Hilfe zu spät

[Verse 12: Interchopper]
It's been eternal pleasure to chop with y'all
Ain't no hypothetical, I'm actual mythical form of-
Versatility/vast mobility now bro
Listen up, I'm fed up with your intentions to slow down you'd better watch yo ass you're bout to face poison gas
Don't step over line, you will act as activator
Natural navigator, hell of an instigator
Turn me into Terminator, it's time to be innovator
I've never been a motherfucker withoutta guts to chop them into minimal nuts
You were talking like you wanna put the flames to this bitch, so just do it
And stop talking shit!
Or I'll be clipping up magnum hop on it bump on it
Making you my bloody bad bitch you fucking fat snitch
Call me the chopper
You've never ever pulled a trigger, never killed nobody
You think you're a killer? I'm God over here

[Verse 13: Crucified]
(Don't Fuck with the...)
Put em in a bag and I fuck em all up they coming to taking it back but they come on and they looking and playing a game with the fucker
Many deal with a person who making a bluff and I'm breakin' em off
And i'm making the posse that makin' em run
We be takin' em closer making em faster makin' em close it, I'm making em puzzled, look at em jump
This time i'm breakin' a syllable thinkin'
How long we gonna be how will they build
But if i can predict for the fuck of it fucking the plan up
They gotta be telling me fill em with flows that are makin' em plot
To bringing and braking and making a rut
The feeling of bringin' it bigger
Then run up, I done em, I get em all then I'm all done
Murder begun let em all run
They can never get away when i'm bringing the tongue
I'm being shone
Nobody is done try to get up on my level they can never become
Come back from the grave
But don't look at my face
If i get em in place
Like I'm hearing the tome
When I load me a bowl of my greenery strong
I then open my third eye and they better run
But if they’re thinking of bringing it wicked and bringing the pain I’m living I'm thinking I’m giving a fuck about the hater that never think I been on, get em
Many motherfuckers went off but I caught em
Try to get away and I’m planning to bring slaughter
Open up to face with the razor blade that start up
Told you with the breath of the face I can trace smarter
And brought up in heart of this
Picking em buckin' 'em making em panic and praying to their father
Do you really wanna get it
You become a target bout die quick in a minute
You don’t really wanna be the one that I’ma fill up with the Cobalt
And they wind up with their mother fucking missing
They don't want to listen
Look into the vision
Kill em with a burden when I get em in the kitchen
I’m sick of the fighting I make pulp when I’m coming to break em up
And murder anybody who be thinking that they be fucking with the mission to be underground chopping1Embed
