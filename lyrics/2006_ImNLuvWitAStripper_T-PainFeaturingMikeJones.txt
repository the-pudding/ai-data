40 ContributorsIâ€™m N Luv (Wit a Stripper) Lyrics[Intro: T-Pain]
Goddamn, lil' mama
You know you thick as hell, know what I'm sayin'?
Matter fact, after the club, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Me and my niggas gon' be together, know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't even worried 'bout them really, though, I'm just lookin' at you
I mean, shit, you know
You got them big-ass hips, goddamn

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Got the body of a goddess
Got eyes butter pecan brown, I see you, girl (Drop it low)
She comin' down from the ceiling (To the floor)
Yeah, she know what she doin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She doin' that right thang (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need to get her over to my crib and do that night thang

[Chorus: T-Pain]
'Cause I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin', she rollin', she rollin'
She climbin' that pole and
I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin', she playin', she playin'
I'm not goin' nowhere, girl, I'm stayin'
I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin', she rollin', she rollin'
She climbin' that pole and
I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin', she playin', she playin'
I'm not goin' nowhere, girl, I'm stayin'
I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
She's every man's dream, she's God's gift to Earth
Women, they love 'em too, that's what you call a woman's worth
See, I love all the strippers because they show me love
They know I never pay, it's free whenever I hit the club
But I can't even lie, the girls in here so fly
She slidin' up and down that pole, got me mesmerized
Mike Jones don't ever trick, but, goddamn, she thick
I can't lie, I must admit
[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin', she rollin', she rollin'
She climbin' that pole and
I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin', she playin', she playin'
I'm not goin' nowhere, girl, I'm stayin'
I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin', she rollin', she rollin'
She climbin' that pole and
I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin', she playin', she playin'
I'm not goin' nowhere, girl, I'm stayin'
I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 4: T-Pain]
She can pop it, she can lock it
Teddy Pend-her-ass-down is 'bout to see this sexy girl (In my bed)
She don't know what she is doin' (To my head)
Yeah, she turnin' tricks on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She don't even know me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I done got her over to my crib to do that night thang

[Chorus: T-Pain]
'Cause I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin', she rollin', she rollin'
