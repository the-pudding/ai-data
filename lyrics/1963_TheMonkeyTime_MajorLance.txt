5 ContributorsThe Monkey Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a place right across town, whenever you're ready
Where people gather 'round, whenever they're ready
And then the music begins to play
You feel a groove comin' on its way

[Chorus]
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Well, you get yours 'cause I got mine
For the Monkey Time (Monkey Time)
(Monkey Time)

[Verse 2]
Now the dance that the people do, I don't know how it started
All I know that when the beat brings a feel
It's hard to get parted
And then the music begins to play
Automatically you're on your way

[Chorus]
Are you ready (Are you ready?)
Well, you get yours 'cause I got mine
For the Monkey Time (Monkey Time)

[Bridge]
Ah, do the Monkey, yeah (Do the Monkey Time)
Ah, do the Monkey, yeah (Do the Monkey Time)
And twist them hips (Twist them hips)
Let your backbone slip (Let your backbone slip)
Now move your feet (Move your feet)
Get on the beat (Get on the beat)
You might also like[Chorus]
Are you ready (Are you ready?)
Well, you get yours 'cause I got mine
For the Monkey Time (Monkey Time)
(Monkey Time)

[Verse 3]
Now this dance that the people do, I don't know how it started
All I know that when the beat brings a feel
It's hard to get parted
And then the music begins to play
Automatically you're on your way

[Chorus]
Are you ready (Are you ready?)
Well, you get yours 'cause I got mine
For the Monkey Time (Monkey Time)

[Outro]
Ah, do the Monkey, yeah
Give me a big strong line
You're looking real fineEmbed
