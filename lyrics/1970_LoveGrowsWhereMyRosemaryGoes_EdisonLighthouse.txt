She ain't got no money
Her clothes are kinda funny
Her hair is kinda wild and free
Oh, but love grows
Where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

[Verse 2]
She talks kinda lazy
And people say she's crazy
And her life's a mystery
Oh, but love grows
Where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

[Chorus]
There's something about
Her hand holding mine
It's a feeling that's fine
And I just gotta say, hey!
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well
That I can't get away

[Verse 3]
I'm a lucky fella
And I just got to tell her
That I love her endlessly
Because love grows
Where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me
You might also like[Chorus]
There's something about
Her hand holding mine
It's a feeling that's fine
And I just gotta say, hey!
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well
That I can't get away

[Verse 4]
I'm a lucky fella
And I just got to tell her
That I love her endlessly
Because love grows
Where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

[Outro]
It keeps growing every place she's been
And nobody knows like me
If you've met her, you'll never forget her
Nobody knows like me
La-la, believe it when you've seen it
