49 ContributorsEmotion Lyrics[Intro: Beyoncé]
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
It's over and done, but the heartache lives on inside
And who is the one you're clinging to instead of me tonight?

[Pre-Chorus: Destiny's Child & Kelly Rowland]
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go, go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no—
(Nobody left in this world to hold me tight)
And don't you know, there's no—
(Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight)
Kiss goodnight
(Goodnight, goodnight)
(Goodnight)

I'm there at your side, apart of all the things you are
(Ahh-ah, ahh-ah)
But you gotta find some one else
You gotta go find your shining star

[Pre-Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go, go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
(Taking me over)
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no—
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
(Nobody left in this world to hold me tight)
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Nobody left in this world
Goodnight
[Pre-Chorus: Destiny's Child & Michelle Williams]
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
(Don't you know I'm lost without you baby)
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
(Yeah, nobody, nobody to hold me)
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
(Nobody to kiss me, yeah)
Goodnight, goodnight6Embed
