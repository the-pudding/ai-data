Hey, slow it down
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
Yeah, I'm afraid
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

There might've been a time when I would give myself away
Oh, once upon a time, I didn't give a damn
But now, here we are
So whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
