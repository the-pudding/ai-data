9 ContributorsDon’t Disturb This Groove Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, hoo, hoo
Baby
Hoo, hoo, hoo

I'm in Heaven
Listen

[Verse 1]
Pay attention — are you listening?
You're my favorite girl
Excuse me for the moment
I'm in another world
On a mountain, by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with cupid
The picture's very clear

[Chorus]
Hang the sign upon the door
I say, "Don't disturb this groove"
(All I want is just me and you)
Just a way to say that
(That's simple enough)
I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real, don't disturb this groove
You might also like[Verse 2]
Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for the moment
I'm at a loss for words
By election, sheer perfection
And as if these eyes would care
Your heart is in the right place
So don't you go and change
Baby, over and over
The passion starts again (Again)
You're my lollipops and everything
With a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from Heaven
And the day the earth stands still

[Chorus]
Hang the sign upon the door
It says, "Don't disturb this groove"
(All I want is just me and you)
Just a way to say that
(That's simple enough)
I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real, don't disturb this groove
(All I want is just me and you)
'Cause I want to tell you that
(That's simple enough)
I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real, don't disturb this groove
[Bridge]
When it feels so real, don't disturb this groove
Hoo, hoo, hoo

Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood
Can you feel it? (Uh-huh) Uh-huh
Ooh, baby, just lock the door and turn the phone off
It's time, it's time for me and you
Are you ready? (Yes)

[Chorus]
Hang the sign upon the door
I say, "Don't disturb this groove"
(All I want is just me and you)
Just a way to say that
(That's simple enough)
I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real, don't disturb this groove
(All I want is just me and you)
'Cause I want to tell you that
(That's simple enough)
I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real, don't disturb this groove
[Outro]
(All I want is just me and you)
'Cause I need you, baby; I need you, baby
(Just so that I'm understood)
I need you
(Don't you, don't disturb this groove)
'Cause I need you, baby
(It's just me and you)
I need you, baby
(Yes, that's simple enough)
Baby, I need you
(And it's understood)
When the feeling's so real, don't disturb this groove
'Cause we're groovin', baby; I'm groovin', baby
And I love it, baby, the way you do the things to me, baby
(It's just me and you)
And I love it, baby, love it, baby, love it, baby
And it's understood
Don't you, don't disturb this groove
It's just me and you
Yes, that's simple enough
And it's understood
Don't you, don't disturb this groove1Embed
