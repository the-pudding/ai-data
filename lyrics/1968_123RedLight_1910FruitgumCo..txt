3 Contributors1, 2, 3 Red Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every time I try to prove I love you
1, 2, 3, red light
You stop me
Baby, you ain't right
To stop me
1, 2, 3, red light
You stop me

[Verse 2]
Every time I make a move to love you
1, 2, 3, red light
You stop me
Baby, every night
You stop me
1, 2, 3, red light

[Bridge]
Stop the game (Stop the game)
You've got too much to lose (Too much to lose)
If you stop me again
That's when we might end
So please don't refuse (Please don't refuse)

[Verse 3]
Every time I make a move to love you (Every time I make)
1, 2, 3, red light
Don't stop me
Baby, you ain't right
To stop me
1, 2, 3, red light
Don't stop me

When I know I'm right

[Organ Solo]

[Verse 5]
Every time I make a move to love you

Baby, you ain't right
To stop me

Won't stop me

Every time I try to prove I love you
1, 2, 3, red light
