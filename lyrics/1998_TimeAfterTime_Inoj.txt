8 ContributorsTime After Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm lying in my bed
Hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...
Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
And you said, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me (And you will find me)
Time after time (Time after)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time
You might also like[Verse 2]
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secret stolen
All from deep inside
The 808's on time

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time (Time after)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (And I will be waiting)
Time after time (Ooh)
(That's right, mmm)
Time after

[Breakdown]
And you said, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The 808's on time

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time (Time)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (Yeah)
Time after time (Time after)
If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me (I know you will find me)
Time after time (Time after)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time
[Outro]
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)
Time after time (Time after time)Embed
