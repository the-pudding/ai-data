Please don't just stand there
Come and kiss me like before
Please don't just stand there
Looking down at the floor

[Chorus 1]
If something is wrong
Give me just one little sign
If there's someone else, please tell me
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind

[Post-Chorus 1]
Once when we'd meet
You'd run to hold me tight
Life was so sweet
Until tonight

[Verse 2]
Please don't just stand there
Get it over, if we're through
Please don't just stand there
While my heart breaks in two

[Chorus 2]
Knowing I care
How can you be so unkind?
Please, stop hurting me and help me
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind
You might also like[Post-Chorus 2 (spoken)]
If it's a game
I don't want to play it
And if it's goodbye
Why can't you just say it?

[Chorus 3]
Why make me cry like you do?
How can you be so unkind?
Please start loving me or leave me
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind

[Outro (Fade)]
(Don't just stand there)
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind
(Don't just stand there)
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind
(Don't just stand there)
Tell me, what, what, what
What's on your mind...Embed
