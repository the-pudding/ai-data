16 ContributorsDiscothèque Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can reach, but you can't grab it
You can't hold it, control it
You can't bag it (Uh)
You can push, but you can't direct it
Circulate, regulate, oh no
You cannot connect it

[Refrain]
You know you're chewing bubble gum
You know what that is, but you still want some
You just can't get enough of that lovey-dovey stuff

[Verse 2]
You get confused, but you know it
Yeah, you hurt for it, work for it, love
You don't always show it, love

[Chorus]
Let go, let's go, discothèque
Go, go, let go, discothèque

[Post-Chorus]
Looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead
You wanna be the song
The song that you hear in your head
Love, love, love, love
You might also like[Verse 3]
It's not a trick, 'cause you can't learn it
It's the way you don't pay that's okay
'Cause you can't earn it, love

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you're chewing bubble gum
You know what that is, but you still want some
You just can't get enough of that lovey-dovey stuff

[Chorus]
Let go, let's go, discothèque
Go, go, let go, discothèque

[Post-Chorus]
Looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead
You wanna be the song
The song that you hear in your head
Love, love, love

[Outro]
But you take what you can get
'Cause it's all that you can find
Oh, you know there's something more
But tonight, tonight, tonight
Boom-cha, boom-cha, discothèque
Boom-cha, boom-cha, discothèque
Boom-cha, boom-cha, discothèque
Boom-cha, boom-cha, discothèque
Boom-cha, boom-cha, discothèque
Boom-cha, boom-cha, discothèque2Embed
