When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

[Verse 2]
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

[Chorus]
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

[Verse 3]
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

[Chorus]
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

[Chorus]
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
Oh
Don't wanna live
By myself, by myself
Anymore
By myself
Anymore
Oh

[Outro]
All by myself
Don't wanna live
I never, never, never
Needed anyone10Embed
