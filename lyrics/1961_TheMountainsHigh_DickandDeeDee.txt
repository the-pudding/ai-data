Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
The mountain's high and the valley’s so deep
Can't get across to the other side
Don't you give up, baby, don’t you cry
Don't you give up 'til I reach the other side
I was lonely, baby, I couldn't sleep
The night they took you from my side

[Bridge]
I was a lonely soul
Until you became my goal
And then I saw the spark of love
And then the stars fell from
Up above, oh yeah

[Verse]
I know someday we will meet again
But I don't know exactly where or when
But, baby, if fate has its way
We'll meet again some other day

[Chorus]
The mountain's high and the valley's so deep
Can’t get across to the other side
Don’t you give up, baby, don't you cry
Don’t you give up 'til I reach the other side
I was lonely, baby, I couldn't sleep
The night they took you from my side
