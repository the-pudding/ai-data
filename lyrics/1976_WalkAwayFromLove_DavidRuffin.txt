6 ContributorsWalk Away from Love Lyrics[Intro]
(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

[Verse 1]
It's not that I don't love you
You know how much I do
And it's not that I've found someone
To take the place of you
It's just a fear that builds within me
Every time you touch my hand
And a dread that shakes my body
That even I don't understand

[Chorus]
So I'm leaving (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love, breaks my heart

(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

Ooo, you're clinging to me tighter
Than you ever have before, I don't understand it
But I know it's gonna take everything I've got
To keep walking out the door
But those arms you've got around me
Will let me go some day
And I'd rather leave you holding on
Than pushing me away

[Chorus]
So I'm leaving, yes I am (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love, breaks my heart

(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So I'm leaving, yes I am (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love, breaks my heart
[Outro]
Ooh baby
It's not that I don't love you (I'm gonna walk away from love)
You know how much I do (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
Oh baby (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

I'm leaving baby
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm gonna walk away from love)
Oh, don't break my heart (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
I'm walkin' away baby

(I'm gonna walk away from love)
Ooh, will you let me go someday, baby? (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
(Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

I'd rather have you holdin' on, holdin' on' (I'm gonna walk away from love)
Oh, than pushin' me away, woohoo (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

Ooh wee, baby, yeah
So I'm leavin' (I'm gonna walk away from love)
I know you know, playin' it smart (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
Don't you break my heart, baby (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

I'm leavin' baby, yeah (I'm gonna walk away from love)
Ha ha, I don't wanna be the one to cry, no baby (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
And it's not that I've found someone new (I'm gonna walk away from love)
Oh, just to take the place of you (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
I've got to (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

I'm leavin' baby, whoo-hoo hoo (I'm gonna walk away from love)
Oh baby, I don't wanna do it, now (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

But I'm leavin'
This time I'm playin' it smart (I'm gonna walk away from love)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
Before love breaks my heart (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)Embed
