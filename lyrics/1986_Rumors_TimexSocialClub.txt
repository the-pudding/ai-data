15 ContributorsRumors Lyrics[Verse 1]
How do rumors get started?
They're started by the jealous people
And they get mad seeing something they had
And somebody else is holding
They tell me that temptation is very hard to resist
But these wicked women, ooh, they just persist
Maybe you think it's cute, but girl, I'm not impressed
I tell you one time only, with my business
Please don't mess when you

[Chorus]
Look at all these rumors
They're surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now
About me and the girl next door

[Verse 2]
Did you hear that one about Tina?
Some say she's much too loose
That came straight from a guy
Who claims he's tasted her juice
Did you hear that one about Michael?
Some say he must be gay
I tried to argue, but they said if he was straight
He wouldn't move that way
Did you hear that one about Susan?
Some say she's just a tease
In her camisole, she's six feet tall
She'll knock you to your knees when you
You might also like[Chorus]
Look at all these rumors
They're surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now
About me and the girl next door

[Verse 3]
I can't go no place without somebody pointing a finger
I can't show my face 'cause when it comes to rumors
I'm a dead ringer, it seems from rumors I just can't get away
I bet there'll even be rumors floating around on Judgment Day
I'll think I'll write my congressman and tell him to pass a bill
For the next time they catch somebody startin' rumors
Shoot to kill when you

[Chorus]
Look at all these rumors
They're surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now
About me and the girl next door

[Bridge]
What's mine is mine
I ain't got time for rumors in my life
I'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life
What's mine is mine
I ain't got time for rumors in my life
I'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life (when you)
[Chorus]
Look at all these rumors
They're surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now
About me and the girl next door

Look at all these rumors
They're surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now
About me and the girl next door

[Outro]
Stop (stop) spreadin' those rumors around
Stop (stop) spreadin' the lies
Stop (stop) spreadin' those rumors around
Stop (stop) spreadin' the lies

Stop (stop) spreadin' those rumors around
Stop (stop) spreadin' the lies
Stop (stop) spreadin' those rumors around
Stop (stop) spreadin' the lies
Stop (stop) spreadin' those rumors around
Stop (stop) spreadin' the liesEmbed
