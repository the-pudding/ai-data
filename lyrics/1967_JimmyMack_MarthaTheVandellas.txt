Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?

[Verse 1]
My arms are missing you
My lips feel the same way too
I've tried so hard to be true
Like I promised I'd do
But this boy keeps coming around
He's tryin' to wear my resistance down

[Chorus]
Hey, Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back

[Verse 2]
He calls me on the phone
About three times a day
Now, my heart doesn't listen to
What he has to say
But this loneliness I have within
Keeps reaching out to be his friend
You might also like[Chorus]
Hey, Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back

[Bridge]
Need your loving
(Jimmy Mack, won't you hurry back?)
Need your loving
(Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back?)

[Break]

[Verse 3]
I wanna say
I'm not getting any stronger
I can't hold out very much longer
Trying hard to be true
But Jimmy, he talks just as sweet as you

[Chorus]
Hey, Jimmy, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy, can't you hear me, Jimmy?
Oh, Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back
[Bridge]
Need your loving
(Hurry back, Jimmy Mack)
Need your loving
(Hurry, hurry)

[Outro]
Hey, Jimmy Mack! (Hurry back)
You better hurry back (Jimmy Mack)
Hey, Jimmy Mack (Hurry back)
When are you coming back? (Jimmy Mack)

Oh, I'm not gettin' any stronger (Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, ooh!)
I can't hold out very much longer (Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, ooh!)

Jimmy Mack, when are you coming back? (Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, ooh!)
Need your loving, oh, Jimmy Mack (Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, ooh!)

Need your loving, oh, Jimmy Mack (Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, ooh!)
Need your loving (Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, ooh!)

(Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, ooh!)
(Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, ooh!)

(Hurry back, Jimmy Mack, ooh!)Embed
