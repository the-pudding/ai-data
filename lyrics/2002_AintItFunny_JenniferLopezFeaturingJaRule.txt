Murda Inc
Haha

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
It. Must. Be the ass that got me like damn
If it get any fatter, man, the Rule gon' have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
No, I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald, I'm the Rule and a shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & Ashanti]
Ain't that funny?
It's been a while since you came around
Now you wanna see what's goin' down
Tryna tell me how you want my time
Tryna tell me how I'm on your mind (On your mind)
See, it never had to be this way
You should've never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kind of lame
Knowin' how the situation change

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Ashanti]
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man (Lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Ashanti]
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

[Verse 4: Cadillac Tah]
C-A, double D, ha
Double dose, ma
Fly by, red line, Testarossa and oh I
Never been a sucker for chocha
Spit the ism, hit 'em, get rid of 'em and you know Tah get it gully
And ain't that funny?
How they want me see me workin' with money but Caddy ain't a dummy
What these brodies want from me?
'Cause all I got is G, J.Lo
And Murda I.N.C
[Verse 5: Jennifer Lopez]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryna make me sit and reminisce
Tryna blind me with your blinging bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Ashanti]
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez, w/ Ja Rule & Ashanti]
Baby, is that your girlfriend?
I got my boyfriend
But maybe we can be friends, nah, nah, nah
(Ain't it funny?)
Baby, I've got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend?
But maybe we can be friends, nah, nah, nah11Embed
