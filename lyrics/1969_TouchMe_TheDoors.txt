Yeah!

[Verse]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?
[Chorus]
Now, I'm going to love you
'Til the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
'Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I

[Verse]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?
