Shake up the picture, the lizard mixture
With your dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers
All of which I deny
I said it again
But could I please rephrase it?

I couldn't really put it much plainer
But I'll wait till you decide
Send me your warning siren
As if I could ever hide

[Refrain]

I light my torch and wave it for the

[Chorus]
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite

This time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the

[Chorus]
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite

[Chorus]
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite

[Outro]
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night (Fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite (I light my torch and wave it for the)
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night (Fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold day
