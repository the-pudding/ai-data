(Standing by herself)
(Never had the nerve to take a chance)
(So let the little girl dance)

Let the little girl dance
Let the little girl dance
She never danced before
So let her on the floor
(So let her on the floor)

Let the little girl dance
Let the little girl dance
She wants to give it a try
So let the little girl by
(So let the little girl by)

She's been a little wallflower on the shelf
Standing by herself
Now she got the nerve to take a chance
So let the little girl dance

Let the little girl through
She wants to pass by you
Buddy, can't you see
She wants to dance with me
(She wants to dance with me)

She's been a little wallflower on the shelf
Standing by herself
Now she got the nerve to take a chance
So let the little girl dance

Let the little girl through
She wants to pass by you
Buddy, can't you see
She wants to dance with me
(She wants to dance with me)

(Little wallflower on the shelf)
(Standing by herself)
(Never had the nerve to take a chance)
Let the little girl dance
(Let the little girl dance)Embed
