Ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy
Yeah

[Refrain]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

[Verse 1]
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
They want my life exposеd
They wanna know about the highs and lows

[Verse 2]
Ayy, yeah
I got one, Laurie got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I told you the truth?
Man, how many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels or fuck up the deals
I'm posted in Stockholm
It's me, the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season
[Chorus]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen
