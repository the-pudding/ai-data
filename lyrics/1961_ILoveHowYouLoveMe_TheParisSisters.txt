I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you I love how you miss me
I love the way you always treat me tenderly
But, darling, most of all I love how you love me
(I love how you love me)

[Verse 2]
I love how your heart beats whenever I hold you
I love how you think of me without being told to
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But, darling, most of all I love how you love me
(I love how you love me)

[Verse 3]
I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you I love how you miss me
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But, darling, most of all I love how you love me
(I love how you love me)

[Outro]
I love how you hug me (I love how you hug me)
I love how you squeeze me, tease me, please me
Love, how you love me
