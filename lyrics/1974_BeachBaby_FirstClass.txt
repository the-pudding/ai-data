Do you remember back in old L.A. (Oh-oh-oh)
When everybody drove a Chevrolet? (Oh-oh-oh)
Whatever happened to the boy next door?
The sun-tanned, crew-cut, all-American male

[Verse 2]
Remember dancing at the high school hop? (Oh-oh-oh)
The dress I ruined with the soda pop? (Oh-oh-oh)
I didn't recognize the girl next door
The beat up sneakers and the ponytail

[Chorus]
Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand
Give me something that I can remember
Just like before, we can walk by the shore in the moonlight
Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand
From July to the end of September
Surfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day

[Bridge]
Mmm, I never thought that it would end (Ooh, ooh)
Mmm, and I was everybody's friend (Ooh, ooh)
Long hot days, blue sea haze
Jukebox plays, but now it's fading away
You might also like[Verse 3]
We couldn't wait for graduation day (Oh-oh, no)
We took the car and drove to San Jos√© (Oh-oh-oh)
That's where you told me that you'd wear my ring
I guess you don't remember anything

[Chorus]
Beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand
Give me something that I can remember
Just like before, we can walk by the shore in the moonlight
Beach baby, beach baby, there on the sand
From July to the end of September
Surfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day

[Outro]
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby, do-do, do-do, do-do
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby, do-do, do-do, do-do
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby, do-do, do-do, do-do
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby, do-do, do-do, do-do
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby, do-do, do-do, do-do
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby, do-do, do-do, do-do
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby
Beach baby, beach baby, do-do, do-do, do-do
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby...Embed
