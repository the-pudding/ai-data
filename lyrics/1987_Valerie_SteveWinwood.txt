17 ContributorsValerie Lyrics[Verse 1]
So wild, standing there
With her hands in her hair
I can't help remember
Just where she touched me
There's still no face
Here in her place

So cool, she was like
Jazz on a summer's day
Music, high and sweet
Then she just blew away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now she can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms

[Chorus]
Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be

[Verse 2]
Love songs fill the night
But they don't tell it all
Not how lovers cry out
Just like they're dying
You might also likeHer cries hang there
In time somewhere

Someday, some good wind
May blow her back to me
Some night I may hear
Her like she used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
No, it can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms

[Chorus]
Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
So cool, she was like
Jazz on a summer's day
Music, high and sweet
Then she just blew away
[Pre-Chorus]
Now she can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms

[Chorus]
Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be

[Outro]
I'm the same boy I used to be3Embed
