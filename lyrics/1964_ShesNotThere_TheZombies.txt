Well, no one told me about her
The way she lied
Well, no one told me about her
How many people cried

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know? Why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!

[Chorus]
Well, let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there

[Verse 2]
Well, no one told me about her
What could I do?
Well, no one told me about her
Though they all knew

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know? Why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!
