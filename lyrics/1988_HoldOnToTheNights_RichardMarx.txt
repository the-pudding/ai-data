6 ContributorsHold On To the Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just when I believed
I couldn't ever want for more
This ever-changing world
Pushes me through another door

I saw you smile
And my mind
Could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for awhile
Won't you let me shelter you

[Chorus]
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you
Something more
That I could be yours

[Verse 2]
How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise
Promises in vain
Love that is real
But in disguise

Do we break another rule?
Let our lovers play the fool?
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

[Chorus]
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

[Bridge]
Well, I think that I've been true
To everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you
Makes my heart long to be free

Every time I look into your eyes
I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for
Is right there

[Chorus]
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you more
That I can be yoursEmbed
