Sister Christian, oh, the time has come
And you know that you're the only one
To say, okay

Where you going, what you looking for
You know those boys don't want to play no more with you
It's true

[Chorus]
You're motoring, what's your price for flight?
In finding Mister Right
You'll be alright tonight

[Verse 2]
Babe, you know you're growing up so fast
And mama's worrying that you won't last
To say, let's play

Sister Christian, there's so much in life
Don't you give it up before your time is due
It's true
It's true, yeah

[Chorus]
Motoring
What's your price for flight?
You've got him in your sight
And driving through the night
See Night Ranger LiveGet tickets as low as $9You might also like

You're motoring, what's your price for flight?
In finding Mister Right
You'll be alright tonight

[Chorus]
Motoring
What's your price for flight?
You've got him in your sight
And driving through the night

Motoring, what's your price for flight?
In finding Mister Right
You'll be alright tonight

[Outro]
Sister Christian, oh, the time has come
And you know that you're the only one
To say, okay

But you're motoring
Yeah, motoring4Embed
