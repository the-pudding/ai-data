28 ContributorsCall Me When Youâ€™re Sober Lyrics[Chorus]
Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

[Verse 1]
Should I let you fall
Lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving ourselves
And I'm sick of the lie

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're too late

[Chorus]
Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

Couldn't take the blame
Sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated
No wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're too late

[Chorus]
So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

[Post-Chorus]
You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over
Ah, it's over

[Bridge]
How could I
Have burned paradise?
How could I
You were never mine
[Chorus]
So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me
Just get your things
I've made up your mind17Embed
