75 ContributorsDaytona 500 (500 Bars) Lyrics[Intro: Otis Redding]
It makes it, easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their only, happiness, yeah
Squee-, squee-, squee-
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her

[Verse]
Yeah, Hov invented swag, I'll give him that
But who invented slimed out them niggas in the fitted caps?
Reppin Cincinnati, they ain't ever been there
I'm working the track out, no Under Armour gym wear
Fuck bad bitches, check my list, see Kim there
Stacey Dash, I'll smash and pass
And nut on they face like it's skincare
Can't get rid of me, Game gon' be here like teachers with they tenure
No pen here, straight off the dome
I throw a shot, blocka, knock him straight off his throne
That goes for every nigga, the nigga with the lockjaw
And that heavy nigga, I ain't talking 'bout Ross
He the mother fucking boss, I'm the CEO
Niggas using they Skymiles just to see me flow
I've got the Illmatic CD flow
Fake diamonds, fake kabbalah beads, nigga CB4
I'm gettin' tired of these niggas, Feds puttin' wires on these niggas
I got some Richard Pryors for these niggas
Couple court cases, couple shell cases
Trickling off the ground right next to where the Ace is
I can't take this shit that I'm seeing in the industry
I'd rather be everybody's enemy
In the back of the strip club guzzling some Hennessy
I really made it rain with Meech, I got memories
Fuck with 'em here, blow out your memory
Take the roof off of the Chevy, we ride Kennedy
Like a bottle of Patron, one nigga can't finish me
Whoop a nigga's ass, he'll tell the cops it was 10 of me
Ice on my neck, I ain't ever had an injury
I-I-Ice on my wrists, I ain't ever had an injury
Meanwhile niggas see me with the Doctor
Platinum plates on the Phantom nigga, welcome to the opera!
Welcome to mi casa, shrimp scampi and lobster
Big bowl of OG kush, watching Shottas
Nigga take a hit of that
It's California kush, five, you ain't gotta send it back
Quarterback, nigga I got the center back
Get Charlie Sheen on the phone, tell him to win it back
The summer over nigga, tell them that the winter back
Take that boy crown, bitch nigga, come get it back
Snapback? Fuck that, authentic fitted cap
Nigga talk shit, then it's off with his fitted cap
O-O-Off with his fitted cap
Let these niggas know that the boss of the city back
I need a 7 5/8 Philly hat
Rozay, where that nigga Meek Milly at?
Where Beans? Where Chris? Where Gillie at?
Can't stop Bloodin', I'm a fucking hemophiliac
First nigga on the set with a red rag
Then the industry took my whole swag
Pound sign, dag
And all of you niggas is fucking fags
I dare you come play up on the boy curb
Twenty niggas with me, can't one of them spell "hors d'oeuvres"
Pearl handle, but I don't eat oysters
Catch 'em in the hood, 24s on that Porsche
Annulment, had to divorce her
She ain't wanna get in the truck, I had to force her
Heard she wasn't giving it up, you had to force her
Buy homegirl some bottles to intercourse her
Where they do that at?
Where my Bloods at? Where my soo woo rag?
Where my lil nigga from where they do voodoo at?
Four albums, all number ones, go and Google that
So I'm banned like the number ones
How you tryna make it rain with 100 ones?
Nigga, I'm married to the game, no cummerbund
Everyday I'm in the Range with another gun
I'll snipe ya... no Wesley
I'm the king, motherfuck Elvis Presley
I'm the king and I be smoking, dare a nigga come test me
Put two 9s on your back, Wayne Gretzky
Yo, I'm ahead, they can't catch me
5 to 10 and over, nigga, arrest me
I'll be out tomorrow, my lawyer'll beat that
Now nigga, go and tweet that
I just did, nigga, retweet that
And tell Floyd I've been workin' on the speed bag
If he don't fight Pacquiao, then I'm up next
Cut his eyes like Jimmy Iovine cut checks
I'm a millionaire, nigga, fuck stress
Put me on Basketball Wives, it'd be a fuckfest
Shout out to Funk Flex, Shout out to DJ Clue?
Shout out to DJ Skee, Shout out to DJ Pooh
He gon' cry when he get in the car
Like I cried blood tears when I was gettin' this star
Like I told Vida Guerra she wasn't gettin' that far
Got some head then I kicked that bitch up out of the car
But look at the bright side, it was a SLR
And you been kicked out of worse, don't act like I was the first
Then came Amber, alert
You ain't 'posed to talk about a nigga wife but she squirt
Like a soda can, I can murder this beat if Yeezy and Hova can
So here we go again
Pounds of the kush and a couple of my oldest friends
Last week, I was in my Uncle Otis' Benz
Back it up into the throne, it's totaled then
Only had it for a week, it ain't broken in
I'll probably never be king, it's kinda soakin' in
Heard I'd never go big from Napoleon
He had a complex, all I got is concepts
Classics, legendary, straight up out the projects
San Diego Aztec, number one prospect
Aston Martin, that's a foreign object
Phantoms, 'Raris, wasn't 25 yet
Lambos, Mazzis, wasn't sayin' "Five" yet
Seventeen million, my son wasn't 5 yet
Disrespect the whole rap game and ain't die yet
Hov, let's make a side bet
I'm a J. Cole fan, can a nigga drop next?
Damn, I mean he got a good thing (Ooh!)
Yeah, call Pay Per View: can me and 50 box yet?
Dr. Dre, can I hear Detox yet?
Yeah, I got some singles on that bitch
Where that ho Maliah at? Got some singles for that bitch
Turn on the radio, got some singles on that bitch
Pot of Gold, Me and Chris Kringle on that bitch
Goin' HAM in the club, you should see me in this bitch
Spades bottle tall as Bobby Valentino in this bitch
How it turn into Casino in this bitch?
Tell 'em it's Gee Money, I'm with Nino in this bitch
On my toes like a ballerina in this bitch
No Prodigy at Summer Jam screamin' in this bitch
Child prodigy, Bobby Fischer leanin' in this bitch
Alpo ass niggas ain't wanna see me gettin' rich
Too late for that though, I got cash flow
Young Fidel Castro, actin' like a asshole
And I don't know better
I ain't know if this a Louis Vuitton or Polo sweater
To me, the YSL logo better
Watch a knock-off cause these hoes know better
I made The Documentary, I'll be rich forever
Like my nickname Dick, I'll be rich forever
Pause, now applaud
And let these real Hip-Hop fans count my bars
Let these real Hip-Hop haters count my cars
Back to Swishers, fuck a Cuban cigar
Unless it's handed to me by a Cuban
All these haters on my Dirk so I might as well smoke it with Mark Cuban
Old nigga, New York knees, Ewing
Kyrie Irving, give a fuck about a two-inch
Got these bitches giving me brains, so stupid
Finally got the Otis instrumental, had to loop it
New school rapper shot by Cupid, stupid
Everybody sayin' they sick, I got lupus
And I'm still on the block like the New Kids
I got a few kids, I got a few cribs
I got a new kid so I bought a new crib
2.5 stupid, not a new crib
50 helped a nigga out, but the truth is
All of this shit from one freestyle on Whoo Kid
If I ain't the king, then nigga tell me who is
If I ain't won the west the last 9 years, who did?
I'll wait, while I'm starin' at my Hublot
In my Blackberry looking for bitches that do blow
Used to push weight, like a sumo
Give it to my bitch, let her stuff it in the culo
Take it to the visitor room, give it to Bruno
He nickel bag and slide it in the new box of Uno
But that's too much inf, for the you know
Where I'm from a rat'll never give orders to Bluto
I heard your lil' album, kudos
They say the shit a classic, nigga, I got a few of those
A few hoes, new clothes like I'm Jason Derulo
So nigga step to the side like a Euro
And a nigga get too close
Louisville slugger to the dome, Pujols
Niggas don't like Game, they a bunch of putos
I'm sippin' mojitos with Ms. Puerto Rico
Drew League floor seats, Durant shootin' free throws
Back to the spot, left eye in the peep hole
A1 Perico, stay up out my stash
I'm just a middleman, niggas fuckin' up my cash
Police pulled me over, now they fuckin' with my dash
2 blocks to go, toss that shit up in the trash
2 Glocks'll blow, put a bullet in your ass
Like Plaxico, got you jettin' up the Ave
I swear to God man, these niggas make me laugh
'Posed to be my future, you ain't fuckin' with my past
I shoot first, ask questions last
Kobe mindstate, why the fuck would I pass?
Boost crime rate, then make Twitter crash
All in one day with my controversial ass
My grandmama SMH, my mama like, "Damn"
The hoes LOLing and my niggas goin' HAM
Run your lips like Gina, shit get thick like Pam
This a blood sport, Jean Claude Van Damme
180 bars, man damn
Love Farrakhan but I'm 'bout to go HAM
You hear what I just said? Nigga damn
I love the beef but I'm 'bout to go HAM
Yeah, hard as a motherfucker
Open my garage, see cars like a motherfucker
Walk up in the club, see broads like a motherfucker
Bitches pulling titties out of bras like a motherfucker
Ace of Spades, black card like a motherfucker
You niggas broke, RushCard like a motherfucker
Outside the club, plush cars like a motherfucker
And we ain't rent shit, these ours like a motherfucker
But fuck with my niggas, see stars like a motherfucker
Snoop, Busta and Nas, they my motherfuckers
2V2's and AR like a motherfucker
Kid Red, Wackstar like a motherfucker
Slept on it but this Otis beat hard as a motherfucker
Drums weak as fuck, need Mars like a motherfucker
Give the drummer some
Bitch get on your knees and give a plumber some
I'm leakin', sound like Just Blaze in this bitch
It's Black Wall kiss my black balls, the K's in this bitch
N dot W dot A in this bitch
Game ball hard, need a agent and shit
Any one of you niggas getting blazed in this bitch
And we could fight to the death, put a cage in this bitch
200 for the Yacht, where the spades in this bitch?
Got them white bitches plankin' like slaves on a ship
Import, export
Feds on the landing strip, meet me at the next port
And abort the operation if I text y'all
Never mind that, my connect be the escort
Let's rewind that, back to my mama Escort
Keys overseas way before I had a passport
Kis in the trunk, '95 Honda Passport
I got whatever you need, ain't gotta ask for it
It's a Dillinger in the V stuffed in the dashboard
Nigga been fucking with rock, no Damon Dash boy
And it's a damn shame what happened to Dame
He ain't even get to keep his Roc-A-Fella chain
Or the Rocawear chain or the Armadale liquor
You was already down, nigga ain't have to kick ya
With ya own Pro Keds, in ya forehead
Nigga treat his own friends like the dope heads
Guess he Scarface and you Frank Lopez
This here holy water, put that on the Pope head
Something like a priest nigga, nothing like a pastor
When that R.E.D. drop, just prepare for the rapture
Lock me out of Canada, balling like the Raptors
Shit don't even matter, name floating in the rafters
Got the .44 on me, call me Tom Raptor
Roll it up in the Phantom and blow it up out the Aston
All they see is R.E.D. I'm holding up all this traffic
They tellin' me I'm sick but I'm sittin' fat like Magic
Bars, tragic, niggas know I'm a savage
Won't appreciate it til years after I perish
Be a old nigga ballin', yeah, Robert Parish
With a white bitch, cornrows, looking like Bo Derek
Got my white bitch in the hood, I call her Kreayshawn
She better stay between the lines like a crayon
Cause the block is something I spend all day on
Posted up with something long as the nigga Tayshaun
And I'm off probation
So I'm back in the kitchen, Raekwon
This is just a intermission, stay calm
262 bars, Napalm
Thats 238 to go
This for my unsigned niggas just waiting to blow
I know it's niggas 'round your hood just hatin' ya flow
Baby mama in ya pockets steady taking your dough
It's gon' be boos in the crowd, niggas hating your show
Couple niggas hidin' that love, they just hatin' to show
But what don't kill you, only make you stronger
Twenty-minute sets, stay on ten minutes longer
I was just like you, still got the hunger
Couldn't see in the dark, feelin' like Stevie Wonder
Waitin' on my turn when Dre pulled my number
I was Spongebob for the next three summers
Then I did numbers, mama I made it
Took the Unit under, still got haters
Die-hard fans from Compton to Decatur
Ten million sold, still carry the lasers
Said I still carry the lasers
Lupe, what up?
Still got D, G Wall for the blazers
Still pack Heat don't make a nigga D-Wade ya
Don't make me get on my phone and call my pager
Translation: them my shooters, Pacers
Niggas say they really got heart, but them is pacers
New West niggas is spitters, razors
Tyler the Creator, K-Dot, Jay Rock
Glasses, Crooked, your boy got the Bay locked
But me and Tyga got the hoes, Baywatch
Meaning we put on a show, while they watch
Watch us hustle like Nipsey
Thirty bottles of Spades, nigga we ain't even tipsy
So with that rap shit, miss me
All these niggas pussy, won't nobody diss me
Nigga I don't blame ya, better do ya history
Every nigga that tried died, a motherfuckin' mystery
Fuckin' with the misfit
You got a company, I'll kill that motherfucker
See what I did to Fifth shit
That's why I'm always popping big shit
I love New York, that's why I'm always bumping B.I.G.'s shit
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was the four-four
Niggas jumping out the window on the fourth floor
But the bitch was scared to jump so I put her on all fours
Four albums, four plaques, Phantom, four doors
I'm the only five, you niggas is all fours
That ain't a classic album, nigga you off course
You need to call Blaze, Swizz Beatz or Scott Storch
Bon'jour wake up in Paris
Sippin on Conjure mix it with cranberry
Baby what kinds yours? We up on the top floor
Niggas on the bottom man, we can see a lot more
Baby I'm a problem
If I see a spade and he sippin' on Spades, I'ma call him
Word to my son Harlem
The boy used to ski in coke, I'm talking slaloms
Courtside next to Snoop, sitting with starlets
I got a thing for red bones and Louis wallets
See the watch making them drool 'cause its retarded
See the cops pointing at dude 'cause he a target
The world is a shooting range, so I'm aiming at the Shy
And I'mma hit that mother fucker in the newest Range
Hit the Southside, doing two and change
Watching Otis so I pulled over and blew the brains
Man its cold out this motherfucker, Gucci Mane
Brr, chinchilla fur
Ain't have to move to Texas but I'm in that flying spur
Don't work with Petco but I could flip the bird
Who got snaps on the petro? Word
I'm trying not to hit my 6's on the curb
Nothing like Sonny but I'm driving in reverse
In love with the money, I shall never deter
Probably with the honeys on 54th and 1st
My pimp hand strong from Cali to Dirty Jers
Church, tabernacle
Look at ya bird, she laughing at you
Shit is absurd, what happen after
Niggas walk out the club, them goons start clappin' at you
Sometime short days can turn into long nights
Steve Urkel niggas trying to life Capone life
You seen Menace, don't get caught up at the wrong light
We shooting K's and handguns got a long flight
Yeah, got the lights on
Backyard looking like Vegas when the fights on
Hood morning, hood evening
Hood afternoon for no reason
Buck 50 to the face now you bleeding
Think he Leonidas, 300 while he cheesing
Hop in that 300, tell my niggas we leaving
Tell that nigga laying the ground we even
No need for oxygen masks, he ain't breathing
Did it with the lights on, Compton raised a heathen
Ain't no fucking witnesses but everybody seen it
They know what the business is, I'm ripping up subpoenas
Got no love for bitches, all I'm giving them is penis
Gotta watch these bitches, they'll take you to the cleaners
They'll starch that ass, they'll press ya
Tryna be Kobe wife, bitch you ain't Vanessa
Bitch you ain't Monica so what's with all the pressure?
I'm rolling my chronic up, bling on the dresser
Out in Santa Monica banging her on the dresser
I don't do the cuffs but she wan't me to arrest her
Take another pump then switch direction
Walk around dolo, I don't need protection
'Less I'm with a groupie, now I need protection
Four condoms, came for the thing, I'm on that next shit
Two word minimum, I ain't trying to text shit
Two drinks at Mr. Chow's, now we on some sex shit
Can't get through the door with this whore, she trying to success
She trying to succeed, she trying to blow me
No strings attached she like a Wii
But when the houselights come on she like a 3
Put her face in a bag, from behind she like Free
And I ain't have to buy the bitch a bag it was free
But that's just for me
Give it to her like "Unnhhh", Master P
Ain't no limit, I go hard as motherfucker
Me and Pacquiao seeing stars like a motherfucker
384 bars like a motherfucker
All out of breath, I should pause like a motherfucker
Nah, I gotta go hard as a motherfucker
Drop top Gotti, foreign cars as a motherfucker
Started off small, living large as a motherfucker
In my rearview, I came far as a motherfucker
Rip the head off Medusa and all the bloodsuckers
Peace to Baby and Slim, them my Blood brothers
Shout out to Waka and Jones, them my blood brothers
Shout out to Styles and Kiss, them my other brothers
Shout out to Tune and Ross, them my other other brothers
Sitting here watching the throne, bored as a motherfucker
Oh man, shit, 100 bars left, let's go
Time to break the beat down for these clowns
Tell my Uncle Otis he can R.I.P now
Go to sleep now, my flow senile
And I ain't tryna get locked up in the penal
System, I can't feel my face
I'm tryna feel the bass but I got all this Ace in my system
Run circles around you rap niggas
Like I'm doing drills for the Pistons
Sleep comfy but I can still hear the whispers
Draw steel, 'cause niggas still don't get the picture
Gotta paint it red just so they can see it
If you can't understand colors, nigga Ice-T it
Now bring the bass back, turn up the sneer
Tell the bitches with lace fronts start fixing they hair
And Mars, give a nigga a drumroll right here
And right there, yeah
Back, back, back up on that rap shit
Keep that Louie knapsack and that backpack shit
GTFOH with that snapback shit
Fucking three bitches a night, call it a hat trick
Los Angeles, Kings
Meaning its more than one, me and Snoop be doing our thing
And I kinda did away with the bling
Use to walk around every fucking day with the bling
Yeah, in and out the fucking safe with the bling
Niggas come around, they ain't safe with the bling
My shine is mine, catch a case for the bling
Out comes the .9 out the waist for the bling
Put this motherfucker in your face for the bling
Burn your tongue, now you ain't got a taste for the bling
80 bars left, whole club sold out
And I'ma get this flow out 'til there ain't no fucking car left
Uh, 'til there ain't a Cuban cigar left
See my nigga Dre in here, yeah he on the far left
Long way from car theft, 'round the corner from homicide
If you seen the shit that I seen, you probably be traumatized
Remember when my brother died, that's what made my mama cry
Spent four years alone then my grandmama died
Damn, I ain't never been the same
Pay homage to the woman that gave the world to Game
So the drama, it will never die, that's on my mama five
Fuck with my kids or my wifey, that's when the llama fly
Can't afford to lose them
If I had to pick between hip hop or my family
Motherfucker, I'd choose them
As far as rap niggas, I break legs and bruise limbs
Stomp a nigga face in in some huge Timbs
Niggas don't invite me to shit, I had to move in
Annihilated Bleek, had to tie a couple loose ends
Couple crashed cars, had to lose a few friends
Wifey want an Escalade, I just copped a new Benz
Fuck stock, hood niggas ride new rims
Dubs too small, fuck it, going 22 then
22 shrinking, now we on 24s
Won't be long til 6's sittin' on that Porsche
Niggas chopping Maybachs, clever, raw
But I'ma chop a Chevy, Mad Max the '64
Bitches love it, niggas like that
Hip Hop was high school punch, I had to spike that
Tell 'Bron and Wade the nigga Mike back
If Uncle Otis rubbed you wrong, go get a ice pack
Undisputed beef king, who the fuck could fight that?
You wanna hit the surplus store, then bring a knife back
Niggas goin' gold, "Shit, them is nice plaques"
Finally, get your ass in the ring, won't fucking fight back
Everybody wants you to swing, go ahead and strike back
Me, I'm spitting nothing but flames, I'm like a strike match
Empire Strikes Back, Jedi Mind Tricks
This is how the stars war, why you acting hard for?
Me, I'm hardcore, middle of Darfur
You don't wanna see what the fuck is inside the car door
I got something big under the T-shirt
On the front, it say Tha Carter IV, I'm 'bout to order more
Nigga, they ain't told you? It's like the Gulf War
Put a hole in one of you niggas, no par 4
'Rari on the green
Got a V12 Ferrari on the green
I be twisting Bob Marley on the green
I took 100 thou' just to add another Mazerati to the team
Shoulda saw me as a teen, facin' the magazine
Any drama, I'm loading up a case of the magazines
Not the Source or the XXL, know what I mean?
Rolling Stone ain't getting my Vibe so I remain King
At least til T.I. home
As far as the East, ain't no King, nigga B.I. gone
Far as bars, that four, ocho cinco
So the next line is for Ocho Cinco
Easy on the Clicqot, homie don't drink so
I'ma guzzle the bottle and find me a fucking sink, yo
Where Otis? Somewhere playing Bingo
Star on my face, I'm a star like Ringo
Ten bars left, Su-Woo is the lingo
All red everything, no Visine though
Just left Boston, no Benzino
Hit something outta New York, Bambino
And I coach my team like Pitino, he know
We hit King of Diamonds, everybody throwing C-notes
On my way to Sin City, pit stopped in Reno
Feeling like Carlito before they casted Pacino
Matter fact, fuck him, De Niro in Casino
500th bar, fuck you; Cee-LoYou might also like3Embed
