Sally go 'round the roses (Sally go 'round the roses)
Sally go 'round the roses (Sally go 'round the pretty roses)
Roses they won't hurt you (Roses they can't hurt you)
Roses they can't hurt you (No, the roses they can't hurt you)

[Verse 2]
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Saddest thing in the whole wide world
Is to see your baby with another girl

[Chorus]
Sally go 'round (Oh, Sally don't you go)
'Round and around (Don't you go downtown)
Sally go 'round (No, don't you go downtown)
'Round and around (Yes, because the)
Saddest thing in the whole wide world
Is to see your baby with another girl

[Verse 3]
Sally go 'round the roses (Sally go 'round the roses)
Sally go 'round the roses (Sally go 'round the pretty roses)
They won't tell your secret (They won't tell your secret)
They won't tell your secret (No, the roses won't tell your secret)
