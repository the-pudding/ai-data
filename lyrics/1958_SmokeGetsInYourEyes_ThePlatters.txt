15 ContributorsSmoke Gets in Your Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied
(Do do do, do do do
Do do do ahh)

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind, ohhh
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

[Verse 2]
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love (Ahh)
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies (Ahh)
Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
