5 ContributorsAmen Lyrics[Intro]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Sing it over
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen

[Verse 1]
See the little baby
Wrapped in a manger
On Christmas morning
Singing in a temple
Talking with the elders
Tomorrow there's wisdom

[Chorus]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Hallelujah
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen

[Verse 2]
Down at the Jordan
John was baptizing
And saving all sinners
See him at the seaside
Talking with the fisherman
And made them disciples
You might also like[Outro]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Keep on pushin' now
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Hallelujah now
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amenEmbed
