Everybody, everybody
Everybody's had a broken heart now
Everybody, everybody
Everybody's had the blues
Everybody, everybody
Everybody's blue when they're lonesome
Everybody, everybody
Everybody's had the blues

[Verse 1]
One time or other, everybody, listen to me
You lose somebody you love
But that's no reason for you to break down and cry

[Chorus]
I said a-hey, everybody, everybody
Everybody's had a lonely moment
Everybody, everybody
Everybody's had the blues

[Verse 2]
One time or other, everybody, listen to me
You lose somebody you love
But that's no reason for you to break down and cry

I said a-hey, everybody, everybody
Everybody's had a lonely moment
Everybody, everybody
Everybody's had the blues
I said a-hey, everybody, everybody
Everybody's blue when they're lonesome
Everybody, everybody
Everybody's had the blues1Embed
