6 ContributorsCount on Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Precious love I'll give to you
Blue as the sky and deep in the eyes of a love so true
Beautiful face, you make me feel
Light on the stairs and lost in the air of a love so real

[Chorus]
You can count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love
To see you through

[Verse 2]
Emerald eyes and China perfume
Caught on the wheel and lost in the feel of a love so soon
Ruby lips, you make my song
Into the night and saved by the light of a love so strong

[Chorus]
You can count on me
Count on my love
Baby, you can count on me
Count on my love
To see you through

[Verse 1]
Precious love I'll give to you

[Chorus]
You can count on me
Count on my love
Baby, count on me (Count on me)
Count on my love
