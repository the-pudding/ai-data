20 ContributorsLoverboy Lyrics[Intro: Mariah Carey, Cameo]
Uh, woah, woah
ReRe's got a new boyfriend (Yeah, ooh)
ReRe and Kenny sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby (Oh)
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby (Woo)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him
I need him, I need him, I need him, I need him
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I got myself a lover who knows what I like
When he invites me over, I come every time
And when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go, it's delirium time

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
He's all mine (I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him)
And his lovin' makes me high (I need him, I need him, I need him, I need him)
Like a taste of ecstasy (I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him)
All I need is him to be my lover boy (I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him)

Lover boy, come on and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me (Yeah)
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (Baby, all night long, come on)
Lover boy, come on and take me (Lover boy, come take me)
Only you know how to make me (Only you can make me, yeah)
Shudder with anticipation all night long (All night)

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey, Cameo]
I got myself a lover and he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven to feel him inside (Come on)
'Cause when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go, it's delirium time

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I get weak (I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him)
When his candy kisses sweetly (I need him, I need him, I need him, I need him)
Caress my whole body (I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him)
All I need is him to be my lover boy (I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey, Cameo]
Lover boy, come on and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (I enjoy the way you rock me)
Lover boy, come on and take me (Come on and take me)
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long (All night)
[Verse 3: Cameo, Mariah Carey, Both]
This stuff is starting now, this stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling I always seem to get around you (Yes, I do)
'Cause you affect me, you fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do, oh (For the things that you do)
This stuff is starting now, this stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now, ooh
My eyes roll in my head, I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you (Oh, lover)
It's like candy (Candy)
Simply put, you're the reason why (You're the reason why)
Even though I'm real shy (Real shy), it's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you (Indeed you do)
Indeed I do, just for you

[Chorus: Mariah Carey, Cameo, Both]
Lover boy, come on and love me
Give me more (Give it to me), touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (All night long)
Lover boy, come on and take me (Strawberry, raspberry)
Only you know how to make me (All those good things)
Shudder with anticipation all night long (Diamonds and gumdrops)
Lover boy (That's what you seem to me)
Lover boy, come on and love me (Oh)
Give me more, touch me and touch me (This stuff is starting)
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (Starting now)
(This stuff is starting now)
Lover boy, come on and take me (Strawberry, raspberry)
Only you know how to make me (All those good things)
Shudder with anticipation all night long (Diamonds and gumdrops)
Lover boy (That's what you seem to me)
Lover boy, come on and love me (Oh)
Give me more, touch me and touch me (Baby)
I enjoy the way you rock me10Embed
