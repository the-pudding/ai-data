Well, now me and Homer Jones and Big John Talley
Had a big crap game goin' back in the alley
And I kept rollin' them sevens and winnin' all them pots
My luck was so good, I could do no wrong
I just kept on rollin' and controllin' them bones
Finally, they just threw up their hands and said
"When you hot, you hot," I said, "Yeah"

[Chorus]
When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
Put all the money in and let's roll 'em again
When you're hot, you're hot
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, when you're hot, you're hot

[Verse 2]
Well, now every time I rolled them dice, I'd win
And I was just gettin' ready to roll 'em again
When I heard somethin' behind me
I turned around and there was a big old cop
He said, "Hello, boys," then he gave us a grin, said
"Look like I'm gon' have to haul y'all in
And keep all that money for evidence"
I said, "Well, son when you hot, you hot," he said, "Yeah"
You might also like[Chorus]
When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
"You can 'splain it all down at City Hall"
I said, "Yeah, when you're hot, you're hot"
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, when you're hot, you're hot

[Verse 3]
Well, when he took us in to court, I couldn't believe my eyes
The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
I said, "Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal
I'll pay you that hundred I owe you if you'll get me outta this spot"
So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
He turned around and grinned at me and said
"Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot"
And I said, "Thanks a lot"

[Chorus]
When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
He said, "Well, when you're hot, you're hot"

[Outro]
I said, "Well, I'll tell you one thing, judge, old buddy, old pal
If you wasn't wearin' that black robe
I'd take you out in back of this courthouse
And I'd try a little bit of your honor on"
"You understand that, you hillbilly?
Who's gonna collect my welfare? Pay for my Cadillac?
What do you mean "Contempt of Court"?
Judge, oh, judge, judgie-poo"Embed
