Close my eyes
And I see your face at night
Tossin', turnin'
Fall to sleep holding my pillow tight

[Pre-Chorus]
All the time, I think of you
You're with me, no matter what I do

[Verse 2]
Walk around
With a smile upon my face
In my mind
You have taken up permanent space

[Pre-Chorus]
Now my life is filled with nothing less
Than your sweet love, care, and tenderness

[Chorus]
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

And I lose all self-control
Touch my hand
And I feel it deep down in my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I am feeling what I can't explain
And if what you're feeling is the same

[Chorus]
Let's get serious, ooh!
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

To a place where love will always shine
