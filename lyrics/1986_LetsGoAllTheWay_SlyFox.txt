Sitting with the thinker
Trying to work it out
It's a traffic jam of the brain
Makes you wanna scream and shout
Presidential party
No one wants to dance
Looking for a new star
To put you in a trance

[Chorus]
Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go all the way

[Verse 2]
Workin' in a factory
Eight days a week
Try to make dollar
Damn, what a beat
Cartoon capers
Happen in reality
Rich man, poor man
Livin' in fantasy
You might also like[Chorus]
Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
Oh-oh-oh
Let's go all the way
Wow

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Livin' in New York
Looks like an apple core (Apple core)
Asphalt jungle
Got to be a man of war
California dreamers
Sinking in the sand
The Hollywood squares are
Livin' in Disneyland

[Break]
Weeee! Ha!

[Chorus]
Let's go all the way
(Let's go all the way)
Let's go all the way
(Let's go all the way)
Aah-aah-aah
Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
[Chorus]
Let's go all the way
We need heaven on Earth today
Aah-aah-aah
We can make a better way
Let's go all the way
Go all the way
Let's go all the way
Yeah

[Outro]
Na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, yeah
Na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, yeah
Na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, yeah
Na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, yeahEmbed
