7 ContributorsNorth To Alaska Lyrics[Chorus]
Way up north (North to Alaska)
Way up north (North to Alaska)
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on

[Verse 1]
Big Sam left Seattle in the year of '92
With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon River and found a bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome

[Verse 2]
Sam crossed the majestic mountains (Mush, mush)
To the valleys far below (Mush, mush)
He talked to his team of huskies (Mush, mush)
As he mushed on through the snow (Mush, mush)
With the northern lights a-runnin' wild (Mush, mush)
In the land of the midnight sun (Mush, mush)
Yes, Sam McCord was a mighty man (Mush, mush)
In the year of 1901 (Mush, mush)

[Chorus]
Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're finding
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
Way up north (North to Alaska)
Way up north (North to Alaska)
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on

George turned to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said "Sam you're a-lookin' at a lonely, lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand
"Cause a man needs a woman (Mush, mush)
To love him all the time (Mush, mush)
Remember Sam, a true love is (Mush, mush)
So hard to find (Mush, mush)
I'd build for my Jenny (Mush, mush)
A honeymoon home (Mush, mush)
Below that old white mountain (Mush, mush)
Just a little southeast of Nome" (Mush, mush)

[Chorus]
Where the river is windin' big nuggets they're finding
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
North to Alaska
We're goin' north, the rush is on
Way up north (North to Alaska)
Way up north (North to Alaska)
Way up north (North to Alaska)
Way up north (North to Alaska)1Embed
