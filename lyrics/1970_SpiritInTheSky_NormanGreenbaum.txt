When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's the best
When I lay me down to die
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky

[Chorus]
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky (Spirit in the sky)
That's where I'm gonna go when I die (When I die)
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best

[Verse 2]
Prepare yourself, you know it's a must
Gotta have a friend in Jesus
So you know that when you die
He's gonna recommend you to the spirit in the sky (Spirit in the sky)

[Chorus]
Woah, he'll recommend you to the spirit in the sky
That's where you're gonna go when you die (When you die)
When you die and they lay you to rest
You're gonna go to the place that's the best

[Chorus]
Woah, set me up with the spirit in the sky (Spirit in the sky)
That's where I'm gonna go when I die (When I die)
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
Go to the place that's the best
