Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
(Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up)
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright (Oh)

[Verse 1: Whitney Houston, (Bobbi Kristina Brown), Background Vocalist]
If tomorrow is Judgement Day (Sing, mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line, mm
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright (It's alright)
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright

[Verse 2: Whitney Houston & Background Vocalist]
If I wake up in World War 3 (World War 3)
(In World War 3)
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I wanna go home
It's okay (It's okay) if you're comin' with me
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright (It's alright)
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright

[Chorus: Whitney Houston]
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

[Verse 3: Whitney Houston & Background Vocalist]
If I lose my fame and fortune (Really don't mind)
And I'm homeless on the street (On the street, oh, Lord)
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station (Ooh, okay)
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright

[Verse 4: Whitney Houston & Background Vocalist]
As the years, they pass us by (The years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (Each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get, oh
It's okay as long, as I got you, babe
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright

[Chorus: Whitney Houston]
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love (Your love, your love, baby)
It would take an eternity to break us

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love (My love is your love)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
[Bridge: Whitney Houston & Background Vocalist]
If I should die this very day (Very, very day)
Don't cry (Don't cry), 'cause on Earth, we wasn't meant to stay
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
And no matter what people say (Really don't matter)
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
I'll be waiting for you after Judgement Day

[Chorus: Whitney Houston]
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us (Can't hold us)
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love (Yes, it is)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us (Break us, baby)
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
