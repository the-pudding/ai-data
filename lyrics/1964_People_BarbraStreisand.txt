6 ContributorsPeople Lyrics[Verse 1]
People
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children
Needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

[Verse 2]
Lovers
Are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person
One very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

[Verse 2]
With one person
One very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
First be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the worldYou might also likeEmbed
