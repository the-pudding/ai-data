8 ContributorsObsession (No Es Amor) Lyrics[Intro: Baby Bash]
Check, check
This happened for real
Baby Bash
Yeah (Haha), Frankie J, obsession

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
Well, it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin' 'bout you, baby, got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin', turning in my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
Well it's five o'clock in the morning and I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do
I think I'm in love, baby

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling?)
What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?

Now, I know you're not my lady but I'm tryna make this right
I don't know what to do, I'm goin' out of my mind
So baby if you let me, kick it wit' you, then well maybe
We could ride together, we could do this all night
Now I don't care if you got a man
Baby, I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right (Uh-uh), quite like I can

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
Well it's five o'clock in the morning and I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I don't know what to do
I think I'm in love, baby

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling?)
What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?

[Bridge: Frankie J]
Ooh, I love the way you freak it like that
Ooh, I love the way you freak it like that
Ooh, I love the way you freak it like that
It's an obsession
[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Hold up, let me dream
Shorty got me feelin' serene
You're my candies and my cream
Got your boy feeling supreme
Hold up, wait a minute
Baby, you so damn independent
Loving everything you representing
Got a lot of money, and I love to spend it
And that's what's up, and I don't care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin', my super fly beauty queen
I'ma keep it saucy 'cause mama know how I do
We gon' rendezvous, mi coraz√≥n belongs to you

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling? )
What am I doing wrong? (What am I doing wrong?)
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling? )
What am I doing wrong? (What am I doing so wrong?)
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?
[Outro: Frankie J]
