19 ContributorsEveryday People Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby-dooby-dooby

[Refrain]
Ooh, sha-sha
We got to live together (Ooh, sha-sha)

[Verse 2]
I am no better and neither are you
We are the same, whatever we do
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah, yeah
You might also like[Verse 3]
There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one that will not help the poor one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby-dooby-dooby

[Refrain]
Ooh, sha-sha
We got to live together (Ooh, sha-sha)

[Verse 4]
There is a yellow one that won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one that won't accept the white one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby-dooby-dooby

[Chorus]
Ooh, sha-sha
I am everyday people (Ooh, sha-sha)1Embed
