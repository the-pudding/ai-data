21 ContributorsSexy Chick Lyrics[Verse: Akon]
Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

[Pre-Chorus: Akon (with David Guetta)]
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen befo'
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood, hood
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
(Damn, girl)

[Chorus: David Guetta]
Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick; damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick; damn, girl

[Verse: Akon]
Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town
