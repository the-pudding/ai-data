I can carry you
Carry in my hands
Ask me a question
I can say to you

I press my right leg, going 180
I close my eyes, believe me, nothing will happen

[Pre-Chorus]
People in the houses wake up early
They wake up, we go home
Turn the switch on and the Sun will shine
With power 60 Watts, hanging on the wire

[Chorus]
Only at night the streets are my house
Only at night the whole city sings excited
At nights you can see how  we stay on the corners
Only at nights it's dark enough to see us
To see us

[Verse 2]
I can carry you
Carry on my shoulders
What do you want to hear?
I'm your radio
You might also likeI steal a bouquet of flowers from cemetery for you
It's Friday's evening, I will come to you

People from homes go home
We put our clothes on, the night beckons us
Later, we'll be telling about the past whole evenings
Watching at our lives at old Blu-Rays

[Chorus]
Only at night the streets are my house
Only at night the whole city sings excited
At nights you can see how  we stay on the corners
Only at nights it's dark enough to see us
To see us
To see us
To see us
To see us

Only at night the streets are my house
Only at night the whole city sings excited
At nights you can see how  we stay on the corners
Only at nights it's dark enough to see us
To see us
To see us
To see us
To see usEmbed
