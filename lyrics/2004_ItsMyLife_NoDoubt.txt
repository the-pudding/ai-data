It's funny how I find myself
In love with you
If I could buy my reasoning
I'd pay to lose
One half won't do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself?

[Chorus]
Oh, it's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends (It never ends)

[Verse 2]
Funny how I blind myself
I never knew
I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'd tell myself
What good do you do
Convince myself
You might also like[Chorus]
It's my life
Don't you forget
Oh, it's my life
It never ends (It never ends)

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself?

[Chorus]
Oh, it's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends (It never ends)
It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends (It never ends)

[Outro]
Oh, it's my life (Oh, it's my life)
Don't you forget (Don't you forget)
Caught in the crowd (Caught in the crowd)
It never ends (It never ends)10Embed
