16 ContributorsNeutron Dance Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna take it anymore
I'll just stay here locked behind the door
Just no time to stop and get away
'Cause I work so hard to make it every day

[Refrain]
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh

[Verse 2]
There's no money falling from the sky
'Cause a man took my heart and robbed me blind
Someone stole my brand new Chevrolet
And the rent is due, I got no place to stay

[Refrain]
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh

[Chorus]
And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
Oh, I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance
I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance

Industry don't pay a price that's fair
All the common people breathing filthy air (Lord have mercy)
Roof caved in on all the simple dreams
And to get ahead your heart starts pumping schemes

[Chorus]
And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
Oh, I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance (Ah, ah, ah)
I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance

[Refrain]
Whoo-ooh
(Whoo-ooh)
I'm on fire, yeah
I'm on fire, yeah

[Chorus]
And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
Oh, I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance (Ah, ah, ah)
I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance
[Outro]
I know there's a pot of gold for me
All I got to do is just believe
Oh, I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance
And I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance
I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance (It's in my hands)
I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance (It's in my feet)
(Well, well, well, well)
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh
I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance
I'm just burnin' doin' the neutron dance
Whoo-ooh
(Whoo-ooh)
Whoo-ooh
(Whoo-ooh)
I'm so happy (It's in my hands)
I'm just burnin' (It's in my feet)
I'm so happy (It's all over me)
I'm just burnin' (I can't help myself)
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'
I'm so happy, I'm just burnin'1Embed
