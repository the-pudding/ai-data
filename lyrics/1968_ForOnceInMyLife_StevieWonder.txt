25 ContributorsFor Once in My Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
Somehow, I know I'll be strong

[Chorus]
For once, I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh, someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true, yeah, yeah, yeah (For once in my life)

[Verse 2]
For once in my life, I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before (Not like it's hurt before)
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore (I'm not alone anymore)

[Chorus]
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me (Someone who needs me)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah (Someone who needs me)
Oh, baby, love, baby

Somebody that needs me (Someone who needs me, yeah)
Ooh baby, for once in my life (Someone who needs me, yeah)13Embed
