Yeah, yeah, Pluto

[Chorus: Future]
I don't hang with rats, that's some new type shit
Get a nigga whacked on the news type shit
Sippin' drank and Actavis on some Screw type shit
Just a sad ho runnin' through the crew type shit
I got a bad bitch at home, voodoo type shit
Take down Meg Thee Stallions by the group type shit

[Verse 1: Future]
That's some thick shit, I just thought you knew type shit
I just tricked off, I don't just usually do this type of shit
Pockets racked up, all blue type shit
Bunch of rich niggas, hoes get confused type shit
Atlanta nigga, I live like Ted Turner type shit
On camera, knockin' jaws loose typе shit
I canceled her, kick hеr out the stu' type shit
A silent hitter, I just keep it cool with you bitches
A solid nigga, countin' dog food type shit
Movin' through the city with your boo type shit
She's ready to suck it up like soup type shit
You goin' against the guys and you gon' lose type shit
Pray to God they knock you out your shoes type shit (Type shit)
