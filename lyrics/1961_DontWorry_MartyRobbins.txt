4 ContributorsDonâ€™t Worry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't worry 'bout me
It's all over now
Though I may be blue
I'll manage somehow

[Verse 2]
Love can't be explained
Can't be controlled
One day it's warm
Next day it's cold

[Verse 3]
Don't pity me
'Cause I'm feeling blue
Don't be ashamed
It might have been you

[Verse 4]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh, love
Kiss me one time, then go, love
I'll understand
Don't worry 'bout me

[Bridge]
You might also like[Verse 5]
Sweet, sweet, sweet, love
I want you to be
As happy as I
When you love me

[Verse 6]
I'll never forget you
Your sweet memory
It's all over now
Don't worry bout me

[Bridge]
When one heart tells
One heart
One heart goodbye
One heart is free
One heart will cry

[Verse 7]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, oh sweet
Sweet baby, sweet, baby sweet
It's alright
Don't worry 'bout me
