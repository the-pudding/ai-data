6 ContributorsDonâ€™t Wanna Lose You Lyrics[Verse 1:]
Sometimes it's hard to make things clear
Or know when to face the truth
And I know that the moment is here
I'll open my heart and show you inside
My love has no pride
I feel with you
I've got nothing to hide
So open your eyes and see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now or ever
Baby, I finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me
I'll be around forever

[Verse 2:]
We all make mistakes
We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time
And I hope that's the way it will stay
It's all up to you to tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
And I know that
You might also like[Chorus:]
I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now or ever, never
Baby, I finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me
I'll be around forever
Forever, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna lose you
Lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow

I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you1Embed
