Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 2]
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down, I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Ooh)
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Ohh)
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Ohh)
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Ohh)
