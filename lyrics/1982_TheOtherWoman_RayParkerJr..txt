7 ContributorsThe Other Woman LyricsOh yeah

I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind
Oh, shucks

I'm just an average guy
I fooled around a little on the side
Never thought it would amount to much
Never met a girl whose love was so tough
Who'd thought a one-night stand
Would turn into such a hot romance?
Mmmm, when she did it to me
I slipped and fell in love

I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind.  Mmmm

Now I know the rules of the game
You hit it once, then break away clean
I should've never gone back, I know
But I had to have just a little bit more
My friends laugh, but that's alright
I may be a fool, but I know what I like
Now I hate to have to cheat
But it feels better when I sneak.  Ow!

With the other woman
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind
Somebody help me
I'm in love, uh huh, (I'm in love)
With the other woman.  (With the other woman)
Hey, hey
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind
Mmmm, hmmm.  Whoa, oh

Oh, this affair is unique
All my life I never met such a freak
She keeps me going strong for so long
When I get home, it's all gone
Makes me wanna grab my guitar
And play with it all night long

Ow!
I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind
Mmmm, tell me
Has anybody else out there ever fell in love
(Fell in love)
With the other woman.  (With the other woman.)
Oh.  With the other woman.  (With the other woman)
