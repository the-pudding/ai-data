Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

[Verse 1]
I got in town a month ago
I've seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I can get em, but as yet I haven't met 'em
Thats how I'm in the state I'm in

[Chorus]
Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way, mhm

[Verse 2]
Another fella told me
He had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein

[Chorus]
Ooh Lord, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
It's hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town

[Chorus]
Oh no, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Ah, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

[Outro]
Ooh, I'm in an awful way (He's in an awful way)
I'm in an awful, ooh, I'm in an awful way
(He's in an awful way)Embed
