Come on

[Verse 1]
Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes no one could ever stain
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Years go by
I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

[Chorus]
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woohoo)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold

[Verse 2]
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Somethin' had a hold on me
When angel passed close by
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that négligée
Is really just too much

[Chorus]
My blood runs cold (Yeah)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold (Oh, yeah)
Angel is the centerfold

[Bridge]
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 3]
Now, listen
It's okay, I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private
[Pre-Chorus]
A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh, no, I can't deny it
Oh, yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

[Chorus]
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold

[Outro]
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na, na--nana-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na--nana-na-na
My blood runs cold (Na-na, na-na-na-na)
My memory has just been sold (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
My angel is the centerfold (Na-na, na-na-na-na)
Angel is the centerfold (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
My blood runs cold (Oh yeah) (Na-na, na-na-na-na)
My memory has just been sold (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
My angel is the centerfold (Na-na, na-na-na-na)
