Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah

[Verse 1]
Don't let me hear you say life's
Taking you nowhere, angel
Come, b-b-b-baby
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come, b-b-b-baby

[Chorus]
There's my baby, lost, that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, wah-wah-wah
Come, b-b-b-baby

[Verse 2]
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
Come, b-b-b-baby
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
Come, b-b-b-baby
You might also like[Chorus]
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Come, b-b-b-baby

[Verse 3]
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry, my sweet, don't break my heart (Come, b-b-b-baby)
Doing all right, but we gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe, oh, Lord, I'll believe all the way (Come, b-b-b-baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Come, b-b-b-baby

[Verse 4]
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come, b-b-b-baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
[Outro]
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years

Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah (Golden years)
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah (Golden years)
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
