10 ContributorsWill You Still Love Me? Lyrics[Verse 1: Jason Scheff, Bill Champlin, Both]
Take me as I am
Put your hand in mine now and forever (Forever)
Darling, here I stand, stand before you now
Deep inside I always knew
It was you, you and me
Two hearts drawn together bound by destiny
It was you and you for me
Every road leads to your door
Every step I take forever more

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Jason Scheff]
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
'Cause I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own (My own)

[Verse 2: Jason Scheff, Bill Champlin, Both]
Take me as I am
Put your heart in mine, stay with me forever
'Cause I am just a man who never understood
I never had a thing to prove
'Til there was you
You and me
Then it all came clear so suddenly
How close to you that I wanna be
You might also like[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Jason Scheff]
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
'Cause I can't go on (Can't go on)
No, I can't go on (Can't go on)
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

[Verse 3: Jason Scheff, Bill Champlin, Both]
Do you believe a love could run so strong?
Do you believe a love could pass you by?
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Jason Scheff]
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
'Cause I can't go on (Can't go on)
No, I can't go on (Go on)
I can't go on
If I'm on my own
I can't go on (Can't go on)
No, I can't go on
[Outro: Bill Champlin, (Jason Scheff)]
'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Can't go on (Without somebody I could call my own)
'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around
'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Can't go on (If you could say you love)
'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, and never be aloneEmbed
