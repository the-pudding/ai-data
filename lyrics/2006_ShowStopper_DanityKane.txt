We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do (Danity Kane)
The boys stare, we smile back (Jim Jonsin)
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah (It's Bad Boy, let's go)

[Verse 1: Aubrey & D. Woods]
Show stoppin' at the latest spot
The ride shinin' with the open top
Hydraulics make our heads go nod
Hair blowin' in the breeze, yo, we superstars
Put in the keys, make that engine purr
Three in the back, one in the passenger
Slow creepin' 'cause we look that fly
All the boys tryna taste our candy ride

[Refrain]
We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah

[Chorus]
Bet you ain't never seen (Aye) chicks ridin' this clean (Aye)
Louis Vuitton seats, we do it deadly (Oh, oh, oh)
That's how we keep it poppin' (Aye), make sure that bass knockin' (Aye)
So, when you see us ridin', we call it show stoppin' (Oh, oh, oh)
We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin' (Aye), make sure that bass knockin' (Aye)
So, when you see us ridin', we call it show stoppin' (Oh, oh, oh)

We sittin' on twenty-two's plus two
Mink bucket seats, neon blue
Color coordinate with them shoes
Yeah, we divas but we ride like big boys do
Black tinted with a white stripe interstate
Lookin' in the mirror at my Bad Boy fitted, yup
Show stoppin' till they lose they breath
Turn the wheel to the right, turn the wheel to the left

[Refrain]
We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah

[Chorus]
Bet you ain't never seen (Aye) chicks ridin' this clean (Aye)
Louis Vuitton seats, we do it deadly (Oh, oh, oh)
That's how we keep it poppin' (Aye), make sure that bass knockin' (Aye)
So, when you see us ridin', we call it show stoppin' (Oh, oh, oh)
We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin' (Aye), make sure that bass knockin' (Aye)
So, when you see us ridin', we call it show stoppin' (Oh, oh, oh)
[Bridge: Dawn & Aubrey]
This is for my ladies in the 280's Mercedes
In the H3 Baby Ranges, Bentley Coupes, my Escalades
Say oh (Oh), oh (Oh, oh)
Break 'em off somethin' proper like a real showstopper
This is for my chicas with the Beamers A6's
'67 Chevys, Maserati, or a Lexus
Say oh (Oh), oh (Oh, oh)
Break 'em off somethin' proper like a real showstopper

[Break: Yung Joc]
Gon' jingle them keys, gon' jingle them keys
Put 'em up real high, make sho' e'erybody see 'em
One time (One time), two times (Two times)
Three times (Three times), four times (Four times)
Gon' jingle them keys, gon' jingle them keys
Put 'em up real high, make sho' e'erybody see 'em
One time (One time), two times (Two times)
Three times (Three times), four times (Four times)
