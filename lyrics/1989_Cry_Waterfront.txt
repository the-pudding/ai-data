Just let me wipe the tears away
Don't mean to act surprised
If it's all right I'd like to stay, yeah

I know that you are not a child
But there's one thing that I love about you
Your style
Cry, please don't cry
Cry, please don't cry

I know you're just sixteen
But looking all of twenty-one
(Twenty-one, you'll be married with a gun)
Daddy would go to jail for you
If he thought you were having the wrong sort of fun

I know that you are not a child
But there's just one thing I love about you
Your style
Cry, please don't cry
Cry, please don't cry

The moment that you've gone
You know that they will talk
But they're wrong, and it makes me happy
Even when you've gone, you know I'll carry on
'Cos I'm strong, and it makes me happy
You might also likeI know that you are not a child
But there's one thing that I love about you
Your style
Don't cry, please don't cry
Cry, please don't cryEmbed
