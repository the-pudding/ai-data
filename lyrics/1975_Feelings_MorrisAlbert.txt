9 ContributorsFeelings Lyrics[Verse 1]
Feelings, nothing more than feelings
Trying to forget my feelings of love
Teardrops rolling down on my face
Trying to forget my feelings of love

[Chorus]
Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it
I wish I've never met you, girl
You'll never come again
Feelings, whoa, oh, oh, feelings
Whoa, oh, oh, feel it again in my arms

[Verse 2]
Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like I've never have you again in my heart

[Chorus]
Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it
I wish I've never met you, girl
You'll never come again

[Verse 2]
Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like I've never have you again in my life
You might also like[Outro]
Feelings, whoa, oh, oh, feelings
Whoa, oh, oh, feel it again in my arms
Feelings, whoa, oh, oh, feelings
Whoa, oh, oh, feel it
Whoa, oh, again1Embed
