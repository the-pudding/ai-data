4 ContributorsLove is Alive Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I think it's time to get ready
To realize just what I have found
I have lived only half of what I am
It's all clear to me now

[Chorus]
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

[Verse 2]
There's something inside that's making me crazy
I'll try to keep it together
'Cause what I say may not happen the same way
Now could be forever

[Chorus]
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

[Bridge]
My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah
