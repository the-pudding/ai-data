Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening
All over this land
I'd hammer out danger
I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All, all over this land

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All, all over this land

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land
I'd sing out danger
I'd sing out a warning, yeah
I'd sing about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All, all over this land

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 4]
Now, I've got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing
All over this land
It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom, yeah
It's the song about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All, all over this land
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All over this land
Ooh, all over this land
Hee, all over this land, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
