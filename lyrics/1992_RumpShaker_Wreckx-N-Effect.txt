[Verse 1: A Plus]
It's called the rump shaker, the beats is like sweeter than candy
I'm feelin' manly and your shaker's comin' in handy
Slide down my cloth from New York down by your Virginia
Ticklin' you around Delaware before I enter
Turn to seduction from face, hips to feet
A wiggle and a jiggle can make the night complete
Now since you've got the body of the year, come and get the award
Here's a hint, it's like a long sharp sword
Flip tail, so let me see you shake it up like dice
The way you shake your rump is turnin' mighty men to mice
But A Plus got a surprise that's a back breaker
Now let me see you shake your rump like a rump shaker

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Yup, yup, it's Teddy, ready with the one-two checker
Wreckx-N-Effect is in effects, but I'm the wrecker
Of the track 'bout the honey shakin' rumps and they backs in
Booties of the cuties steady shakin' but relaxin'
The action is packed in a jam like a closet
Beats bound to get you up, cold flowin' like a faucet
Not mean to make you sit, not mean to make you jump
But, yep, make the hotties in the party shake your rump
I like the way you comb your hair (Uh)
I like the stylish clothes you wear (Uh)
It's just the little things you do (Uh)
That makes me wanna get with you (Uh)

All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom-zoom-zoom
In a pum pum, just shake ya rump (Rump shaker)
All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom-zoom-zoom
In a pum pum, just shake ya rump (Rump shaker, let's break it down)

[Verse 3: Markell Riley]
Shake it, shake it, shake it, now shake it
She can spend every birthday butt-naked
Body is soft, makin' me wanna squish her
More chest than the game, a rumper like a sub-woofer
Shake it to the left (Shake it), shake it to the right
I don't mind stickin' it to her every single night
Come on, pass the pum pum, send it to papa
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it, don't stoppa
Let me see you do the booty hop (Hop)
And now make the booty stop, now drop and do the booty wop (Ooh)
The way you shakin' your reals really kill
Is makin' broth-ills up a whole lotta bills
But I ain't into trickin', just to treatin'
And I ain't into treatin' every trick that I'm meetin'
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Yeah, shake it baby, shake it now, shake it like that
