[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Just one night full of sin (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Feel the pain on your skin (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tough, I don't scream mercy
It's your turn to hurt me, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If I'm bad, tie me down (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Shut me up, gag and bound me (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause the pain is my pleasure
Nothing comes better, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
