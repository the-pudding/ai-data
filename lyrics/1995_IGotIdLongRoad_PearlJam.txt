10 ContributorsToca Tuesday Freestyle Lyrics[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, read the morning paper, kiss my baby girl
Tell my lady I'm gone, until I save the world
Jump in a hot rod wheel, looking super thorough
Rocking a long black cape like the Duke of Earl
My cool don't drop, I bring forth a future twirl
Smash glass in my hands, then produce a pearl
I do the James' on stage, the Big L, the [j...?]
Ya'll know I'm bona fied live, I'm too for real
So the truth prevail, it never fail
Ask me the key to blazing a trail, I never tell
Like the digits on the check in the mail, I give them hell
With the clever rhymes in the squad, situated well yo
The money making jam boys' throwing elbows
You want to holler, you could do the rebel yell yo
I'm not concerned, when will ya'll learn
Truck North, yell these niggas, it's the grand return

[Verse 2: Truck North]
Staring out my window, blowing out some endo
I am legend, niggas kneel like Lorenzo
In this race that I have led, like a pencil
Seen a [?] [?] grace, [l..?] the tempo
But me, I couldn't be nicer if I wanted to
Higher if I wanted to, add another 'W'
Let's have a round of applause, just because
Cause' I'm so fly, I'm thirty seconds to Mars
He's so retard, I go so retard
I'm treated like a Czar, way sicker than ya'll
I'm way off the brain, I maintain the game
North side understand, [p...?] the fucking [f...?]
Hold up, man of the year, the flow of the decade
Surprised like I kicked in his door with four K's
Which one, pick one --they all going to spray
I gave you ample time, pimpin' [now the...] [m...?] [for days?]
I get the crown from the king, and the pussy from the queens
The money from the jacks, the ace of all schemes
[Ten of us holding?] 9's, on the corner, selling eighths
Hello and goodbye from north side the great
A man like the one before you would never kneel
Stay letting motherfuckers have it like Goodwill
What's the deal, fashions so fucked up dog
The ugly shit cost the most, I ain't rich enough to look that poor
Quick on the draw, your mural on the wall
And ya'll niggas out of style like ya' still eat pork
Pop corks on the nightly, haters wanna fight me
Cause' their girls wanna take me to the 'tel and bite me
Spike Lee, do the right thing or you might be
Up shits creek without paddle, oh well
You might also like[Verse 3: Dice Raw]
Yo, they call me mister make it happen, mister make the ladies breathe hard
They get down on their knees, like they see god
People think I love money, but you know I never did
I used to dress real bummy when I was a kid
White lady on the plane, she said, you look nice
Thanks, but what the fuck a nigga 'posed to look like
But I got an idea, my thoughts are very clear
The same as [minds?] when I'm staring at a derri√®re
One track routed, there's no way around it
My heads in the stars, there's no way I'm grounded
My heads in the nosebleed seats by the bleachers
Them clown niggas over there giving me the creepers
Let off the heat-seekers as fast as Derek Jeter
Send them all to St Peters, make them all deep sleepers
Byron Crawford says I carry weed for one of rap's elitist
Then go back to his real job, stuffing them panitas
Yo, I live everyday like I hit the sweepstakes
So don't compare me to none of those cheapskates
Black label, Clark Gable, crocodile briefcase
Got them old white guys looking screw face
But they can tell when to stop looking in Raw's face
Cause' I look at them like Scarface
My grandma, used to clean toilets everyday. and her heart aches
But she ain't raise a dummy, I'm a jack-of-all-trades
And the games, I've all played and I ain't talking about the ones in the arcade
I [let?] them all spray, sinnin' but I think we've all strayed
Away from the shepherd, chasing the cheddar
Still what could be better, they told me it's heaven
But I ain't believe them, so I'm labeled as a heathen
I die for a dollar, only live for the weekend
You get one life, so I dive in the deep end
[Verse 4: P.O.R.N.]
See, some people think I'm an asshole
Cause' I would tell Eve she could bite on the apple
I'm waiting at the light, while she wait at the chapel
Cause' I'm with a chick with some double 'D' naturals
See, I take a nice ass before I take nice girls
Especially if they like weed the way that they like girls
Before I see [a gate?] in the skies with the white pearls
I'd rather spend a night in the 'tel with a white girl
Trippin' off the best of the best in the best [room?]
While my man, Gee's gettin' head in the next room
I play a dirty game, see the world as a rec room
She might get a broke heart, might get a flesh wound
Cause' I'm a evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit
So half of the time I'mma keep it one hundred
[So?] don't play chicken when I'm out of my [rum fix?]
[Might get hit?] in your wing or your drum stick
See, I'm living in sin, I'm cynical
Call me a dick, cause' I [don't ride on] no genitals
Might get the itch, but I don't need Benadryl
I need that work, but I don't do interviews
I do hi-jacks, [juxs?], and [jam jobs?]
Watch where you step, every block is a land mind
There's an old connect, but I don't mean land line
I mean that knack that used to ride with my man [?]
Back from the west coast, pounds of the best [dro?]
Have you in a pool of [your dudes on the dress d...?]
Now put that with the egg with the red yolk
And make bangers that bang until they neck broke
I woke up this morning with a hella hangover
And some mommy looking at me like I motherfuckin' owe her
Don't remember her name, or the buill shit I told her
She looking for the change [?] [?] in the sofa
The only thing on me, knock a nigga out his laundry
Knock him back on his donkey, I'm in love with a junkie
That's in love with an addict, addicted to the pussy
Believe me, I trade her for a bag of weed cookies
Or a good piece of hash, or a young piece of ass
[Put?] me in the mickey, if it gets me a titty
I'm coo-coo for Coco Puffs, [before?] I was old enough
To load it up, hold it up --[I?] crack a nigga coconut
Showing up to class late, half awake --half baked
Hot [teach?] got me fiending for a hot ['T'?]
[Hopeless?] ferocious, doubling my doses
Voices in my head, make it so hard to focus
Please, if you see the reaper on your travels
I got an ounce of super-natural
Now tell him, we can smoke
We can joke, we can bang a little dope
Ever verse, every quote is a suicide note
God damn, [?] [?] [?] mmm mm
[?] [man?]
Must be out my [?] [?] [?]
[Verse 5: Black Thought]
Yo, I'm kinda on the hot side
Wylin' out, while people put me in their top five
Alive or not live
I'm so ahead of my time, I'm counter clockwise
They say I got an ego that match my cock size
I'm from a city called Philly where the shots fly
I'm with them rock stars that cause the rock slide
I'm at a mach five, you at a stop sign
And the wind just like carbon monoxide
Well look at me, I'm in the place to be
We basically, them people that you hate to see
I stay awake, cause' I feel it ain't safe to sleep
The taste maker waiting until they get a taste of Riq'
When I stop, snap the picture --that's black the ripper
The Money Making Jam Boys, hip hop flippers
Just a hustler, trying to get my cake and eat
Word up, I'm in the place to be
Hold up, I told ya'll give thanks and praise to the most high
This twenty-one gun salute, get your [toast?] high
You thinking of testing the truth, gets your hopes high
You going to wind up getting fucked, like a choke job
I'm on the throne, keep the microphone close by
Case I got to touch something like Tone Toca
And I could do it on my own like Oprah
But I'd rather do it with the pack, like Chopra
Me and my [trooper] team, reppin' the two-fifteen
Pull up in something European looking super clean
That silly shorty ain't my love, nigga, Billy Jean
Ya'll know we roll up on the scene, and it's a philly theme
Been getting cream since when [E?] was in [gille?] [jeans?]
I'm still supreme, spilling things --power healing things
My lady, she the illest queen from the Philippines
I'm a [?] [?], hold your applause --[killa' screams?]
I came in on a champagne wish, and [dilla dreams?]
I'm just controlling my rage against the machine
A rock and a hard place, they got me in-between
And when it comes to this mic, I'm still a fiend
What it mean, I'm steady microphone fiendin' --look
I'm in the wrong place for the wrong reasons, and
Sharing the spotlight with my demons, is
The renaissance man, black all seasons --look
In photos posing with my own omens, and
I never chose this live, but it was chosen --it's
Nothing to fear, besides fear and loathing, look
I'm on a job from open time to closing --who
The underrated, underdog with the upper hand
The lead singer, front man for the contraband
Easy to find like firearms in Pakistan
Black's the best, there shall be none after him
To hell and back again, target practicing
Laughing at these emcees that's just rapperin
Until ya'll can stand for something like an acronym
Instead of spitting your rhymes, I'm just slapping themEmbed
