I'm telling you now
I'm telling you right away
I'll be staying for many a day
I'm in love with you now

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you now
I'll say what you wanna hear
I'll be telling you for many a year
I'm in love with you now

[Chorus]
Do you think I'm foolin' when I say, "I love you?"
I love you
Maybe you'll believe me when I'm finally through
Through, through, through

[Verse 3]
I'm telling you now
I know it's been said before
Say you'll love me and I will be sure
I'm in love with you now

Maybe you'll believe me when I'm finally through
Through, through, through

I'm telling you now
I know it's been said before
Say you'll love me and I will be sure
I'm in love with you now
