11 ContributorsFire Lake Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who's gonna ride that chrome three-wheeler?
Who's gonna make that first mistake?
Who wants to wear those gypsy leathers
All the way to Fire Lake?

[Verse 2]
Who wants to break the news about Uncle Joe?
You remember Uncle Joe
He was the one afraid to cut the cake
Who wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah?
Joe's run off to Fire Lake
Joe's run off to Fire Lake

[Bridge]
Who wants to brave those bronzed beauties
Lyin' in the sun?
With their long soft hair fallin'
Flyin' as they run
Ah they smile so shy
And they flirt so well
And they lay you down so fast
'Til you look straight up and say
Oh, Lord
Am I really here at last?

Who wants to play those eights and aces?
Who wants a raise?
Who needs a stake?
Who wants to take that long-shot gamble
And head out for Fire Lake?

[Chorus]
Head out
(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)
And head out
(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)
And head out, head out
(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)
Head out
(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)
Out to Fire Lake

[Outro]
Who's gonna do it?
(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)
Who's gonna do it?
(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)
Who wants to do it?
Who wants to do it, yeah?
(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)
Ooh
(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)Embed
