I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to
I'm your puppet, mm

I'm yours to have and to hold
Darling, you've got full control
Of your puppet

Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips
I'm your puppet
Snap your fingers and I'll turn you some flips
I'm your puppet, mm

Your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
'Cause I'm your puppet
I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you
I'm your puppet
I'm your puppet
You might also likeJust pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song
I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong
I'm your puppet, mm

Treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet and you hold my string
I'm your puppet

I'm your walking, talking (Mhm), living, loving puppet (Yeah)
I'm hanging on a string (Yeah, yeah), I'll do anything (Anything)
Love you and kiss ya and love ya (Yeah, yeah)
Pick you up (Oh, oh) and put you downEmbed
