I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And it don't count for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

[Verse 2]
So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on (Carry on)

[Chorus]
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinkin' aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet
And eager to be what you wanted

[Verse 2]
So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me

[Chorus]

Was I thinkin' aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet
And eager to be what you wanted

Now I'm lost, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love
Now I'm lost, I'm lost in love, I'm lost in love, lost in love2Embed
