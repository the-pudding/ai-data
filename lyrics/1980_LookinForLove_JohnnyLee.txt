11 ContributorsLookinâ€™ For Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I spent a lifetime looking for you
Single bars and good time lovers were never true
Playing a fool's game, hoping to win
And telling those sweet lies and losing again

[Chorus]
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love

[Verse 2]
And I was alone then, no love in sight
I did everything I could to get me through the night
I don't know where it started or where it might end
I'd turn to a stranger just like a friend

[Chorus]
'Cause I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love
You might also like[Bridge]
Then you came a-knockin' at my heart's door
You're everything I've been lookin' for

[Chorus]
There's no more lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I've found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered
You, oh, you, lookin' for love

[Outro]
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes, lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I've found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered
You, oh, you, lookin' for love...1Embed
