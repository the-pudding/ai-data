16 ContributorsItâ€™s a Mistake Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jump down the shelters to get away
The boys are cockin' up their guns
Tell us general, is it party time?
If it is, can we all come?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't think that we don't know
Don't think that we're not trying
Don't think we move too slow
It's no use after crying

[Chorus]
Saying it's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake

[Verse 2]
After the laughter has died away
And all the boys have had their fun
No surface noise now, not much to say
They got the bad guys on the run

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't try to say you're sorry
Don't say he drew his gun
They've gone and grabbed old Ronnie
He's not the only one

Saying it's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake

[Verse 3]
Tell us, commander, what do you think?
'Cos we know that you love all that power
Is it on then, are we on the brink?
We wish you'd all throw in the towel

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We'll not fade out too soon
Not in this finest hour
Whistle your favourite tune
We'll send a card and flower

[Chorus]
Saying it's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake, oh

[Outro]
It's a mistake (It's a mistake)
It's a mistake (It's a mistake)
It's a mistake (It's a mistake)
It's a mistake (It's a mistake)
It's a mistake (It's a mistake)
It's a mistake (It's a mistake)
It's a mistake, it's a mistake
(It's a mistake)Embed
