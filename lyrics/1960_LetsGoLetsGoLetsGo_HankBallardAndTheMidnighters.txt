There's a thrill upon the hill
Let's go, let's a-go, let's go
There's a thrill upon the hill
Let's go, let's a-go, let's go

There's a house honey, way across town
People coming from miles around
Put on your pretty red dress
Let's go see about this mess
That's it, baby let's git
And go way far upon the hill

We're gonna have a whole lotta fun
We gonna greet the risin' sun
All night long we gonna ball
Until we hear yo mama call
That's it, baby let's git
And go way far upon the hill

Let's go, let's a-go, let's go
There's a thrill upon the hill
Let's go, let's a-go, let's go

Let's go!

(sax & instrumental)

Eee-yeah!
Everybody's gonna be there
My friends and yours from everywhere
Oh, what a time it's gonna be!
Come on baby, let's go see
That's it, baby let's git
And go way far upon the hill

There's a thrill upon the hill
Let's go, let's a-go, let's go

There's a thrill upon the hill
A-let's go, let's a-go, let's go

Fades-
