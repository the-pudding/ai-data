15 ContributorsTonight Lyrics[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Well, here we are again
Throwing punch lines no one wins
As the morning sun begins to rise, we're fading fast
And we won't work this out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Every single word's been said (Whoa)
Broke each other's hearts again (Oh)
As the starlit sky begins to shine, we're breaking down
She screams out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

[Outro: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
Well, there's no need to fight, we're just wasting time

We finally worked this out2Embed
