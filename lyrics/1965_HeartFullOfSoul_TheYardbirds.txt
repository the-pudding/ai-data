13 ContributorsHeart Full of Soul Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair
Thinking one thought only
"Where is she, tell me where?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

[Chorus]
And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And I know
If she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul

She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there

[Pre-Chorus]
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

[Chorus]
And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul1Embed
