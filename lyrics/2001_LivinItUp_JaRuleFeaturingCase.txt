[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Baby this ain't your typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, I'ma love you tonight thing, love
Callin' your name, put your phone in the Range and roll over, I just really wanted to hold ya, [?] time to know ya
That's a good chick, before it's all over, I'ma meet this chick
Probably treat this chick, mo' betta
Cause if you ain't, know, thugs and ladies go together
Poppin' my collar patna, who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot and the mug and the watch ugly
Half of y'all hate me, half y'all love me
The ones that hate me only hate me 'cause they don't trust me
And they say I'm lucky, you think I got time to blow all this dough and do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama chargin white Rolls, uh-oh, another episode

Ladies, just wanna hold a name Miss Atkins
That's why they show love with mo' passion than average
And I ain't mad at cha, never leave you alone
Cause it's on when I'm home, like it's on when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus we hit it off at first sight like "Love Jones"
Been in, many zones, baby love it all, hate it all
From prissy women to women that's overshadowed
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up
And got all of y'all, givin' it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Doin' doughnuts and cuts then I open it up
On the freeway, hand on the wheel, foot on the clutch
Rule baby, not givin' it up

[Chorus: Case & Ja Rule]

And all my ladies that be givin it up, uhh

Love you so sexy, I just want you next to me
Your whole vibe like a sign and, ecstasy
Cause it ain't nuttin' but a Inc thing, baby
I know the word is goin' crazy, I wanna
Feel your passion, come when you askin'
Laugh when you cryin', cry when you laughin
But ain't nuttin' happenin', homegirl got a little uptight
Turned off the light and started crashin'
The radio blastin' Between Me And You
But, you in on the low with the freaky thing you do
Girl I thought you knew
(What I do)
You know I know
(What you do)
Cause it ain't a good night if you don't act right
Like, Teddy P let's Turn Off the Lights and
Grind it out, takin' no times out 'till the sun come out, huh
