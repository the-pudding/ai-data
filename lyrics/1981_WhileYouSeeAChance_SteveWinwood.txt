10 ContributorsWhile You See a Chance Lyrics[Verse]
Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

[Chorus]
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because it's all on you

[Bridge]
Don't you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And don't you wonder how
You keep on moving?
One more day your way
Oh, your way

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When there's no one left to leave you
Even you don't quite believe you
That's when nothing can deceive you
You might also like[Chorus]
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because it's all on you

[Verse]
Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And that old grey wind is blowing
And there's nothing left worth knowing
And its time you should be going

[Chorus]
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because it's all on you

[Outro]
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance...4Embed
