6 ContributorsIâ€™ve Done Everything For You LyricsThis one way love affair ain't fair
It ain't no affair to me
It's all give and take and you just take
And I can't take it you see
Well, I'm giving up on love this time
Me and my friends will do just fine

I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me

Yeah someday I'll have a whole lot of money
I'll be a millionaire
But when that didn't happen overnight
I found out how much you really care
All you want is a whole lot of money
All the rest is just jiving honey

I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me

I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me

And get as wild as I can be
I'm gonna find out what it's really like
To be lose, high and free
I don't care what that the people say
I'm taking my mind, I'm changing to stay

I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
You've done nothing for me
You've done nothing
You've done nothing
You've done nothing for meEmbed
