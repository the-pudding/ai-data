Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go?
Baby, I promise that I'll stay true
Don't let nobody say it ain't so
And, baby, I promise
That I will never leave
And everything will be alright
I, I promise these things to you
Girl, just believe
I promise

[Verse 1: Brandon]
Said I know that things just ain't been right
Forever's such a very long time
We never even had a fight
Don't let no one change your mind
'Cause they don't know how much I care
They don't know the things we share unless they're here, babe
But since they're not
How can they say that I'm not true?
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: All & Brian]
If you need a love, I got the love that you need (Said I got the love)
Ain't no way they can take that from me (They can't take that from me)
And I pray to God that one day they will see
They'll see that I'm all that you need
Oh, oh, oh, woah

When I think of all the times I said
That I will see you another day
Baby, nothing's gonna change, yes, it is
