64 ContributorsDon’t Dream It’s Over Lyrics[Verse 1]
There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

[Verse 2]
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion, but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
You know they won't win

[Outro]
Don't let them win
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Don't let them win
They come, they come
Don't let them win
Hey now, hey now (Yeah)
Hey now,  hey now35Embed
