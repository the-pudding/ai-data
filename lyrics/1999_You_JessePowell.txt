8 ContributorsYou Lyrics[Intro]
You!

[Verse 1]
I've finally found the nerve to say
I'm gonna make a change in my life
Starting here today
I surrender all my love
I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
And there's only one reason that I would

[Chorus]
(And baby it's you)
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name and smile
(Baby, you)
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night
(Baby, you)
Every morning you rise
And open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours
From this day forth

Next year lets call this day our anniversary
The day I put
My heart in your hand
And said that it was yours to keep
From this moment on say that you'll always be mine
'Cuz, girl, when I'm alone with you
There's only one thing that's on my mind

[Chorus]
(And baby it's you)
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name and smile
(Baby, you)
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night
(Baby, you)
Every morning you rise
And open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I wanna be yours
From this day forth

[Saxaphone Solo]
[Bridge]
I just wanna be yours
From this day forth

[Outro]
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name and smile
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night
Every morning you rise
And open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I wanna be yours
From this day forth
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name and smile
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night
Every morning you rise
And open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
Just wanna be yours
From this day forth
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name and smile
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night
Every morning you rise
And open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I wanna be yours
From this day forth3Embed
