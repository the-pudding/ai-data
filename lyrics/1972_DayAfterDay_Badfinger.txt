12 ContributorsDay After Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember finding out about you
Every day, my mind is all around you

[Chorus]
Looking out from my lonely room, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you

[Verse 2]
I remember holding you while you sleep
Every day I feel the tears that you weep

[Chorus]
Looking out of my lonely gloom, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you

[Slide Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Looking out of my lonely room, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you

[Verse 1]
I remember finding out about you
Every day my mind is all around you
