One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Oh, you get me ready
In your '56 Chevy
Why don't we go sit down in the shade?
Take shelter on my front porch
The dandelion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade

[Pre-Chorus]
I will do the laundry
If you pay all the bills

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

[Verse 2]
Why don't you stay the evening?
Kick back and watch the TV
And I'll fix a little something to eat
Oh, I know your back hurts
From working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee, my sweet?

I will raise the children
If you pay all the bills

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

[Bridge]
I am wearing my new dress tonight
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes

[Verse 3]
We finally sell the Chevy
When we had another baby
And you took that job in Tennessee
You made friends at the farm
And you join them at the bar
Almost every single day of the week

[Pre-Chorus]
I will wash the dishes
While you go have a beer
[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
Where is my Marlboro Man?
Where is his shiny gun?
Where is my lonely ranger?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
