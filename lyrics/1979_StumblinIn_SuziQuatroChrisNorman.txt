Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our love is a flame, burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us stumblin' in

[Verse 1: Chris Norman and Suzi Quatro, both]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are following you
I've fallen for you, whatever you do
'Cause, baby, you've shown me so many things that I never knew
Whatever it takes, baby, I'll do it for you

[Chorus: Both Suzi Quatro and Chris Norman]
Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our love is a flame, burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us stumblin' in

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: Chris Norman and Suzi Quatro, both]
You were so young, ahh, and I was so free
I may have been young but baby that's not what I wanted to be
Well, you were the one, oh, why was it me?
'Cause, baby, you've shown me so many things that I'd never see
Whatever you need, baby, you got it from me
You might also like[Chorus: Both Suzi Quatro and Chris Norman]
Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our love is a flame, burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us stumblin' in

[Outro: Chris Norman and Suzi Quatro, both]
Stumblin' in, stumblin' in
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Ah, stumblin' in, mmm, stumblin' in
Now and then firelight will catch us stumblin' in
Oh stumblin' in, I'm stumblin' in
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Ohh-ohh stumblin' in (ahh stumblin' in)
I'm stumblin' in (we were stumblin' in)
Now and then firelight will catch us stumblin' in2Embed
