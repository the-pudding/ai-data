I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright

[Chorus]
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again

[Post-Chorus]
Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

[Verse 2]
Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl, it's just me and you
'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite
My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die
You got me misunderstood
But at least I look this good
You might also like[Chorus]
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again

[Post-Chorus]
Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

[Bridge]
Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's somethin' like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need

[Chorus]
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
[Post-Chorus]
Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

[Outro]
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love9Embed
