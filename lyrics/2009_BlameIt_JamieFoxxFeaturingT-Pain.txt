Deep
Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
Aye, she said she usually don't (don't)
But I know that she frontin'
Cause shawty know what she want
But she don't wanna seem like she easy
I hear you saying what you won't do (won't do)
But you know we're probably gon' do (gon' do)
What you been fiendin' deep insi-i-i-ide
Don't let u-u-up now

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
Girl what you drinkin'? Gon' let it sink in
Here for the weekend, thinkin' we can
See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round, if you’re down, I’m pouring

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Fill another cup up, feelin' on your butt, what
You don't even care now, I was unaware how
Fine you was before my buzz set in
My buzz set in
You might also like[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Oopsie, she spilled some drink on me
And now I'm knowin' she tipsy
She put her body on me
And she keeps staring me right in my eyes
No tellin' what I'm gon' do
Baby I would rather show you
What you been missin' in your li-i-i-ife
When I get insi-i-i-ide

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
Girl what you drinkin'? Gon' let it sink in
Here for the weekend, thinkin' we can
See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round, if you’re down, I'm pourin'

Fill another cup up, feelin' on your butt, what
You don't even care now, I was unaware how
Fine you was before my buzz set in
My buzz set in

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Girl, I know you feel good, just like you look
Couple more shots, you open up like a book
I ain't trippin' (Cause I'ma read ya)
Shawty I ain't trippin' (I just wanna please ya)
I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty then you know
It's going down, we can go and kick it like judo (Judo)
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say "ah, ah-ah"
Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride (All wet in my ride)
All over my ride (All over my ride)
She look me dead in the eye, eye-eye
Then my pants got bigger, she already knew what to figure
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck that nigga!"
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & T-Pain]
Blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
Now to the ballers poppin' bottles with they Henny in they cups
Screamin', "Money ain't a thang", if it ain't, throw it up
In the sky (In the sky)
And hold your drinks up high (High)
And to my independent mamas who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model, when them broke fellas holla
Tell 'em, "Bye" (Bye)
And hold your drinks up high

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
You can blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol7Embed
