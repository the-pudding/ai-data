Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have

Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still, in my heart somewhere
There's melody and harmony for you and me tonight
(Ooh, whoa) I hear them call my name

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
[Refrain: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Refrain: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing38Embed
