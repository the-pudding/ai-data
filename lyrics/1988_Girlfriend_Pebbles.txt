12 ContributorsGirlfriend Lyrics[Intro]
To believe or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie and I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea

[Verse 1]
Girl, make a list
Go out and find yourself a new bad thing
Girl, you need a trip
'Cause he's not worth the misery and pain
Just remember how he would tell you lies
And then pretend that everything is so sweet
Why should you sacrifice if you're not satisfied?
He's just a canine runnin' 'round in heat

[Chorus]
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? Oh
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh-woah
Woah, girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad?
(Treat ya, treat ya, treat ya) Oh
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh-woah

Girl, you must resist
Don't let him squirm his way into your heart
No, girl, I must insist
You've got to stop the fool before he starts
Just remember how he was so untrue
With all the tacky things he did to you
No need to signify, 'cause he's not worth your time
You need to find someone that's true to you

[Chorus]
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? Oh
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh-woah
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? (Treat ya, treat ya)
Baby, don't be sad (Oh), no
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh-woah

[Post-Chorus]
To believe or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie and I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Bridge]
Cute, cute, cute, cute
Hey, Deele, sing!
To believe or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie and I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea

[Chorus]
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad?
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? Oh
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh-woah
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? Oh
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh-woah

[Chorus]
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? Oh
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh-woah
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad? (Treat ya, treat ya)
Baby, don't be sad (Oh), no
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh-woah
[Refrain]
Don't let him put you down
Girl, he's been messing around
You've been used, abused
So, baby, make your move
You've learned your lesson now
So, turn this hurt around
Don't be no fool, 'cause you've got to bust loose
Girlfriend, yeah
How could you let him treat you so bad? Oh
Oh, girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had (You know you were the best he ever had, girl)
Oh, oh, oh-woah

[Outro]
Don't let him put you down
Girl, he's been messing around
You've been used, abused
So, baby, make your move
You've learned your lesson now
So, turn this hurt around
Don't be no fool, 'cause you've got to bust loose
Girlfriend, yeah
How could you let him treat you so bad? Oh
