I walked alone between some old adobe haciendas
Suddenly, I heard the plaintive cry of a young Mexican girl:

La la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la
La la la la

You better come home Speedy Gonzales
Away from tannery row
Stop all of your drinking
With that floozy named Flo!
Come on home to your adobe
And slap some mud on the wall!
The roof is leaking like a strainer
There's loads of roaches in the
Hall
(La la la la)

Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales)
Why don't you come home?
Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales)
How come you leave me all alone?

"He, Rosita, I have to go shopping downtown for my mother
She needs some Tortillias and Chilli Pepper!"

La la

Your doggie's gonna have a puppy
And we're running out of Coke
No enchiladas in the icebox
And the television's broke
I saw some lipstick on your sweatshirt
I smell some perfume in your ear
Well, if you're gonna keep on messin'
Don't bring your business back a-here
(La la la la)

Mmm, Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales)
Why don't you come home?
Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales)
How come you leave me all alone?

"He, Rosita, come quick!
Down at the cantina
They're giving green stamps with Tequila!"
La, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la
La la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la
La la la la la
