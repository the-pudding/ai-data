6 ContributorsGoinâ€™ Out of My Head Lyrics[Chorus]
Well, I think I'm going out of my head
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head
Over you
Over you

[Verse 1]
I want you to want me
I need you so badly
I can't think of anything but you

[Chorus]
And I think I'm going out of my head (Out of my head)
'Cause I can't explain the tears I shed (No, out of my head)
Over you
Over you

[Verse 2]
I see you each morning
But you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

[Refrain]
Goin' out of my head over you (Out of my head)
Out of my head over you (Out of my head)
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
You might also like[Bridge]
I must think of a way
Into your heart
There's no reason why
My being shy
Should keep us apart

[Chorus]
And I think I'm going out of my head
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head

[Refrain]
Goin' out of my head over you (Out of my head)
Out of my head over you (Out of my head)
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Oh, come on (Wrong or right)

(Night and day and night) Yeah
(Wrong or right) Oh, alright
Yeah (Night and day or night)
Everyday (Wrong or right)
Every, every, yeah (Night and day and night)
Come on (Wrong or right)Embed
