3 ContributorsA Rockinâ€™ Good Way (To Mess Around and Fall in Love) Lyrics[Verse 1: Brook Benton & Dinah Washington]
If you're gonna give me good kisses like that (What?)
Honey, don't you know I'm gonna give 'em right back (So give 'em here)

[Chorus: Brook Benton, Choir]
That's a kissin' good way
(That's a kissin' good way)
Ah, that's a kissin' good way
(That's a kissin' good way)
Haha, now, that's a kissin' good way to mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)

[Verse 2: Dinah Washington]
If you're gonna start out by huggin' me tight
Don't mess around, just hug me right

[Chorus: Dinah Washington, Choir, Brook Benton]
'Cause that's a huggin' good way

That's a huggin' good way to mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)

[Bridge: Brook Benton, Dinah Washington]
Haha, dig this, you remember this?
You know you called me on the phone (Yeah, baby)
And just because I was alone
Yes, you came around wooin' (Admit it, admit it)
Ah, you better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doin', yeah
