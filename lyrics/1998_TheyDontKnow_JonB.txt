16 ContributorsThey Donâ€™t Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
Heard about my past, things I used to do
The games I used to play, the girls that didn't last
I know what's on your mind, think I'm doin' wrong
Can I say what is real? You are the only one
When I'm not around, do you think of me?
Or what the jealous ones are claimin' me to be
You should know by now, that it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you for us to make it through

[Pre-Chorus]
You should know, baby, you're my angel
Nothing's gonna make you fall from Heaven
Girl, I just want to love you, love you

[Chorus]
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about-'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about-'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here

[Verse 2]
Girl, lets talk about what your friends told you
That I'm a selfish man, want my cake and eat it to
Maybe in my past but you changed me now
Now that I've learned to love, it's you that showed me how
Your love so real I'd be a fool to play
Play around on you, I want to stay with you
You should know by now that it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you for us to make it through
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You should know it, you're my angel
Nothing's gonna make you fall from Heaven
Girl, I just want to love you, love you

[Chorus]
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about-'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about-'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about-'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about-'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here

[Break]
You're my angel (Yeah, yeah)
I want you, baby, to stay with me
I won't let you down, you'll see, babe
You'll see it
[Chorus]
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about-'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about-'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about-'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here
Don't listen to what people say10Embed
