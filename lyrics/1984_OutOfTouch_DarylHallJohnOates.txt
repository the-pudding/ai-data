Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
I'm wakin' up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

[Chorus]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Reachin' out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or livin' in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't
Use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much
You might also like[Chorus]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Interlude]
Out of touch
Out of touch
Wow

[Chorus]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around (Oh, 'round)
You're out of touch (We're soul alone, girl)
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
(Out of touch, out of time, out of touch, out of time, girl)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch (Reach out for something to hold), time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
(You're too cold, girl, too cold, girl, too cold, girl, yeah)
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
Not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
(Out of touch, out of time, out of touch, out of time)
(Out of touch, out of time, girl)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
Yeah, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch (Focus)
I'm out of time21Embed
