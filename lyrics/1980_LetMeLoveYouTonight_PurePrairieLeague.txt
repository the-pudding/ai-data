Dark clouds are blowin' in the wind
He's crossin' your mind again
You've got that sad, sad feelin' from a broken heart
And feelin' so close to the end

[Chorus]
Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright

[Verse 2]
When you find out how good love can be
You're so lost when it sets you free
They say once in your life, you find someone that's right
Someone who loves you like me

[Chorus]
Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright

[Bridge]
When the moon has forgotten what the night's about
And the stars can't work their places out
Hold me tighter than tight
When the daylight comes, it'll be alright

Let me love you tonight

Let me love you tonight
