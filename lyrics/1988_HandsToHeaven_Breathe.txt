10 ContributorsHands to Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
As I watch you move
Across the moon-lit room
There's so much tenderness in your loving
Tomorrow, I must leave
The dawn knows no reprieve
God, give me strength when I am leaving

[Pre-Chorus]
So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That we'll be back together someday

[Chorus]
Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness

[Verse 2]
As we move to embrace
Tears run down your face
I whisper words of love so softly
I can't believe this pain
It's driving me insane
Without your touch
Life will be lonely
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So raise your hands to heaven and pray (And pray)
That we'll be back together someday

[Chorus]
Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness
Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Morning has come, another day
I must pack my bags and say
Goodbye, goodbye

[Chorus]
Tonight, I need your sweet caress (Oh whoa)
Hold me in the darkness (Darkness)
Tonight, you calm my restlessness (Oh whoa)
You relieve my sadness (Sadness)
Tonight, I need your sweet caress (Oh whoa)
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness (You calm my restlessness)
You relieve my sadness
[Outro]
No, no, whoa
Oh, oh, oh whoaEmbed
