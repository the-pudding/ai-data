Mmm, mmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah (Enough is enough)
No more walking 'round with my head down (Yeah)
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you

[Chorus]
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be
That's the reason

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Bridge]
(Oh, leave me alone) Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs) Oh-oh, hey
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs (Hey), so tired of tears (So tired of tears)
So done with wishin' she were still here (Oh)
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Ooh, oh)
So why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears (So tired of tears)
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Hey)
Why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs (So sick of love songs)
So tired of tears (And I'm so sick, so sick of love song)
So done with wishing you were still here
(And I'm so sick, so sick of love songs)
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Hey)
So why can't I turn off the radio?
[Outro]
Why can't I turn off the radio?
Why can't I turn off the radio?52Embed
