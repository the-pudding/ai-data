Like a small boat on the ocean
Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

[Pre-Chorus]
And all those things I didn't say
Were wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

[Chorus]
This is my fight song (Hey)
Take back my life song (Hey)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey, ha)
My power's turned on (Hey)
Starting right now, I'll be strong (Hey)
I'll play my fight song (Hey)
And I don't really care if nobody else believes (Ha)
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

[Verse]
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep, say I'm in too deep (In too deep)
And it's been two years, I miss my home (I miss my home)
But there's a fire burning in my bones (In my bones)
Still believe, yeah, I still believe

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

[Chorus]
This is my fight song (Hey)
Take back my life song (Hey)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey, ha)
My power's turned on (Hey)
Starting right now, I'll be strong (Hey)
I'll play my fight song (Hey)
And I don't really care if nobody else believes (Ha)
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

[Post-Chorus]
A lot of fight left in me

[Refrain]
Like a small boat on the ocean
Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
[Chorus]
This is my fight song (Hey)
Take back my life song (Hey)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey)
My power's turned on (Hey)
Starting right now, I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song (Hey)
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
