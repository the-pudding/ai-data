Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

[Verse 1: Kelly]
Better move 'cause we've arrived
Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly
The baddest chick, chick in sight
DJ, jam tonight
Spotted me, a tender thing
There you are, come on, baby
Don't you wanna dance with me?
Can you handle, handle me?

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
You gotta do much better
If you're gon' dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you're gon' dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully, if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can hang with me
By the looks, I got you shook up and scared of me
Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff
You might also like[Chorus: Beyoncé, All]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hee)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

[Post-Chorus: All]
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

[Verse 3: Kelly]
I'm about to break you off
H-town goin' hard
Peep my hips, slap my thighs
Swing my hair, squint my eyes
Lookin' hot, smellin' good
Groovin' like I'm from the hood
Look over my shoulder, I blow you a kiss
Can you handle, handle this?
[Chorus: Beyoncé, All]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hee)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hee)
I don't think you're ready for this (Hee)
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Babe, babe, babe)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Babe, babe, babe)
I don't think you're ready for this (Baby)
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe

[Verse 4: Michelle]
Move your body up and down
Make your booty touch the ground
I can't help but wonder why
Is my vibe too vibealacious for you, babe?

[Bridge: All]
I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip with my hips, you slip into a trance
I'm hopin' you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz
Pa pa de do da-de
Pa pa de do da-de do
Pa de-de oh
Pa de-de oh
Pow pow pow pow
[Chorus: All, Beyoncé]
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (I don't think)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (You're ready)
I don't think you're ready for this (Hee)
'Cause my body too bootylicious for ya, babe
