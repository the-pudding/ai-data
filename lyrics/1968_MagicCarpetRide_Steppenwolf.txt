24 ContributorsMagic Carpet Ride Lyrics{Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:29}

[Verse 1]
I like to dream
Yes, yes, right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sound, I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near to the stars away from here

[Chorus]
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl
On a magic carpet ride?
You don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?
Fantasy will set you free

[Post-Chorus]
Close your eyes, girl
Look inside, girl
Let the sound take you away
[Verse 2]
Last night I held Aladdin's lamp
And so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Well, someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around, a lousy candle's all I found
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl
On a magic carpet ride?
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?
Fantasy will set you free

[Post-Chorus]
Close your eyes, girl
Look inside girl
Let the sound take you away

[Chorus]
You don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl
On a magic carpet ride?
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?
Fantasy will set you free9Embed
