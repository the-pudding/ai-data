16 ContributorsSuicide Blonde Lyrics[Intro]
Don't you know what you're doing? (Oh)
You've got a death wish
Yeah?
Suicide blonde, suicide blonde
Suicide blonde, suicide blonde

[Verse 1]
Suicide blonde was the colour of her hair
Like a cheap distraction
For a new affair
She knew it would finish
Before it began
Woah, baby, you lost the plan

[Chorus]
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde

[Verse 2]
She stripped to the beat
But her clothes stay on
White light everywhere
But you can't see a thing
Such a squeeze, a mad, sad moment
Glory to you, glory to you, take me there
Ooh, take me there (Ow)

You got some revelation put into your hands
Save you from your misery
Like rain across the land
Don't you see the colour of deception?
Turning your world around again

[Chorus]
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde, say it

[Post-Chorus]
(You wanna make—)
(You wanna make—)
You wanna make her suicide blonde
You wanna make— (Hahaha)
Ow

[Bridge]
That's the story
Everything you wanna be
Everything you are, are
Mm-mm, yeah
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde (Oh)
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde, yeah

[Outro]
Love devastation
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You wanna make her suicide blonde2Embed
