(Now didn't I do it, baby, didn't I do it, baby?)
Gave you the love you never knew, girl, oh
(Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?)
I've cried so many times and that's no lie
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry

Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I, this time?

I thought that heart of yours was true, girl
(Now, didn't I think it, baby, didn't I think it, baby?)
But this time I'm really leaving you girl, oh
(Hope you know it, baby, hope you know it, baby)

Ten times or more, yes, I walked out that door
Get this into your head, there'll be no more

Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I, this time?

(Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?)
(Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?)

Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time

Girl, can we talk for a second?
(Baby can we talk)
I know it's been a long time
Since someone blew your mind, like I did
(Ooh, baby)
But there'll be other times
(Didn't I blow your mind it happens all the time)
For me and you
(All the time)(Ooh, baby)
And I can see the tears fallin' from your eyes
(I can see the tears falling from your eyes)
Tell me girl did I blow your mind?

Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I, this time?Embed
