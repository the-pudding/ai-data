I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'

[Verse 1]
Everytime you're near
Everytime I see you smile
Hear your "hello"
Saying you can only stay a while

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hey, I know that it's hard for you
To say the things that we both know are true
But tell me how come (I)

[Chorus]
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'

[Verse 2]
Everytime I hear
How you never want to live a lie
How it's gone too far
And you don't have to tell me why
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why you're gone and why the game is through
If this is what's real, if this is what's true
Tell me how come (I)

[Chorus]
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore (Baby)
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear (Yeah)
I keep forgettin'

[Bridge]
Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that
I know you're not mine anymore-anyway-anytime
But tell me how come (I)

[Chorus]
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin' (Every time you're near)
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'5Embed
