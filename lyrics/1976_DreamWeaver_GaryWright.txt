17 ContributorsDream Weaver Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've just closed my eyes again
Climbed aboard the Dream Weaver train
Driver, take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

[Chorus]
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

[Verse 2]
Fly me high through the starry skies
Or maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

[Chorus]
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light
You might also like[Verse 3]
Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side

[Chorus]
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

[Outro]
Dream Weaver
Dream Weaver
