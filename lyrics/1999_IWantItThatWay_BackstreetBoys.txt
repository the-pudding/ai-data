Yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 1: Brian]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

[Verse 2: Nick]
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

[Chorus: Nick & All]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Verse 3: AJ, AJ & Brian]
Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way
You might also like[Chorus: AJ, All & Brian]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Bridge: Kevin, Kevin & AJ]
Now I can see that we're fallin' apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

[Verse 4: Howie, Nick & All]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are (You are, you are, you are)
Don't wanna hear you

[Break: All & Nick]
Ain't nothin' but a heartache (Say, hey, yeah)
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (Don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (Oh, yeah)
I want it that way
[Chorus: Brian, All, Nick & AJ]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (Don't wanna hear you say)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (Never wanna hear you say, yeah)
I want it that way
