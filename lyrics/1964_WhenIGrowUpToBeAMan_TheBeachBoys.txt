When I grow up to be a man

[Verse 1: Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds

[Chorus: Group]
When I grow up to be a man?

[Verse 2: Mike Love, Group, Brian Wilson]
Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
(fourteen, fifteen)
Will I settle down fast or will I first wanna travel the world?
(sixteen, seventeen)
Now I'm young and free, but how will it be

[Chorus: Group]
When I grow up to be a man?

[Bridge: Group]
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh

Will my kids be proud or think their old man is really a square?
(eighteen, nineteen)
When they're out having fun, yeah
Will I still want to have my share?
(twenty, twenty-one)
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life (rest of my life)

[Chorus: Group]
When I grow up to be a man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a man?

[Outro: Group, Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
(twenty-two, twenty-three)
Won't last forever
(twenty-four, twenty-five)
It's kind of sad
(twenty-six, twenty-seven)
Won't last forever
(twenty-eight, twenty-nine)
It's kind of sad
(thirty thirty-one)
Won't last forever
(thirty-two)1Embed
