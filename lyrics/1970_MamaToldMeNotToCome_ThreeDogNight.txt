19 ContributorsMama Told Me (Not to Come) Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Want some whiskey in your water?
Sugar in your tea?
What's all these crazy questions
They're askin' me?
This is the craziest party
That could ever be
Don't turn on the lights
'Cause I don't wanna see

[Chorus]
Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
"That ain't the way to have fun, no" (Uh-uh!)
[Keyboard Hook]

[Verse 2]
Open up the window
Let some air into this room
I think I'm almost chokin'
From the smell of stale perfume
And that cigarette you're smokin'
'Bout scared me half to death
Open up the window, sucker!
Let me catch my breath

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son" (She said, oh yeah!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
The radio is blastin'
Someone's knockin' at the door
I'm lookin' at my girlfriend
She's passed out on the floor
I've seen so many things
I ain't never seen before
Don't know what it is
I don't wanna see no more

[Chorus]
Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
(She said) "That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"

[Bridge]
Mama told me, mama told me
Mama told me, told me, told me
Mama told me, told me, whoa, yeah, yeah
Mama told me not to go, no, no, no
Mama, mama told me, mama told me
Surrender now
[Chorus]
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"

[Chorus]
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
