Teen Angel
Teen Angel
Teen Angel

[Verse 1]
That fateful night
The car was stalled
Upon the railroad track
I pulled you out and we were safe
But you went running back

[Chorus]
Teen Angel
Can you hear me?
Teen Angel
Can you see me?
Are you somewhere up above?
And am I still your own true love?

[Verse 2]
What was it you
Were looking for?
That took your life that night
They said they found my high school ring
Clutched in your fingers tight
You might also like[Chorus]
Teen Angel
Can you hear me?
Teen Angel
Can you see me?
Are you somewhere up above?
And am I still your own true love?

[Verse 3]
Just sweet sixteen
And now you're gone
They've taken you away
I'll never kiss your lips again
They buried you today

[Chorus]
Teen Angel
Can you hear me?
Teen Angel
Can you see me?
Are you somewhere up above?
And am I still your own true love?

[Outro]
Teen Angel
Teen Angel
Answer me? Please!Embed
