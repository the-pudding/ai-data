18 ContributorsTalk Dirty to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know I never
I never seen you look so good
You never act the way you should
But I like it
And I know you like it too
The way that I want you
I gotta have you
Oh yes, I do

[Verse 2]
I never
I never ever stay out late
You know that I can hardly wait
Just to see you
And I know you cannot wait
A-wait to see me too
I gotta touch you

[Chorus]
'Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
'Til I'm screaming for more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me

You know I call you
I call you on the telephone
I'm only hoping that you're home
So I can hear you
When you say those words to me
And whisper so softly
I gotta hear you

[Chorus]
'Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
'Til I'm screaming for more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me

[Bridge]
C.C. pick up that guitar and a-talk to me
Whoo, whoo, whoo

[Chorus]
'Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind them bushes
'Til I'm screaming for more, more, more
Down the basement
And lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me, yeah
[Outro]
And baby
Talk dirty to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And baby
Talk dirty to me
Whoo
That's the way I like it, baby
Ooh, yeah5Embed
