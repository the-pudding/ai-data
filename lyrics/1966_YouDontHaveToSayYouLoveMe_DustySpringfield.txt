22 ContributorsYou Donâ€™t Have to Say You Love Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you
And now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you
And beg you to come home?

[Chorus]
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe me
I'll never tie you down

[Verse 2]
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel
You might also like[Chorus]
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

[Outro]
Believe me, believe me, believe me2Embed
