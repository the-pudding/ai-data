17 ContributorsThen He Kissed Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, he walked up to me
And he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice
And so, I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me

[Verse 2]
Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know
That he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered, "I love you"
And he said that he loved me, too
And then he kissed me

[Bridge]
He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
He kissed me In a way that I want to be kissed forever more

[Verse 3]
I knew that he was mine
So, I gave him all the love that I had
And one day, he took me home
To meet his mom and his dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me

[Outro]
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me3Embed
