Uh, it's another one, yeah, another one
Dre and Vidal
Ciara, showin' up

[Verse 1: Ciara]
This is where they stay crunk, throw it up, dubs on the Cadillac
White tees, Nikes, gangstas don't know how to act
Adamsville, Bankhead, College Park, Carver Homes
Hummers floatin' on chrome, chokin' on that home-grown

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
They got that southern cookin', they got them fellas lookin'
Thinkin' I was easy, I can see it
That's when I say, "No, what for?"
Shawty can't handle this, Ciara got that fire like

[Chorus: Ciara]
Oh (Oh), 'round here we ridin' slow (Slow)
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in the club, we gets low, oh
Oh (Oh), all my ladies to the floor (Floor)
Handle it, ladies back it up
Gettin' crunk up in the club, we gets low, oh

[Verse 2: Ciara]
Buddy take a new whip, paint strip, into a bowlin' ball
Still smoke, hundred spoke, wood-grain on the wall
Light-skinned thick chicks, fellas call 'em redbone
Close cuts, braids long, gangstas love 'em all
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
They got that southern cookin', they got them fellas lookin'
Wishin' I was easy, I can see it
That's when I say, "No, what for?"
Shawty can't handle this
Ciara got that fire like

[Chorus: Ciara]
Oh (Oh), 'round here we ridin' slow (Yeah, we ride slow, oh, oh)
We keep it gutta, you should know (You should know)
Gettin' crunk off in the club, we gets low (Get low) oh (Oh, whoa)
Oh (Oh), all my ladies (Get down) to the floor
Handle it ladies, back it up
Gettin' crunk up in the club, we gets low, oh

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, Luda, okay
Southern-style, get wild, old skools comin' down
In a different color whip, whip, whip
Picture perfect, you might wanna take a flick, flick, flick, flick, flick
Call up Jazze, tell him pop up the bottles
'Cause we got another hit, hit, hit
Wanna go platinum? I'm who you should get, get, get, get, get
Ludacris on the track, get back, trick
Switch on the 'Lac, I'm flexin' still
Same price every time, hot song
Jumped on 'cause Ciara got sex appeal
And I keep the meanest, cleanest, baddest
Spinnin' on stainless wheels
Could care less about your genius
I bump ya status, I keep the stainless steel
Trunk-rattlin', what's happenin', huh?
I don't even think I need the speed
Bass-travelin', face-cracklin', huh?
Turn it up and make the speakers bleed
Dirty south, we ballin', dawg
And never think about fallin', dawg
Ghetto harmonizin', surprisin'
Run it back 'cause the song is called
[Chorus: Ciara]
Oh (Oh), 'round here we ridin' slow (Ridin' slow)
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in the club, we gets low, oh
Oh (Oh), all my ladies to the floor
Handle it ladies back it up
Gettin' crunk up in the club we gets low, oh
Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in the club, we gets low, oh
Oh (Oh), all my ladies to the floor
Handle it ladies back it up
Gettin' crunk up in the club, we gets low, oh4Embed
