There must be some word today
From my boyfriend, so far away
Please, mister Postman, look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me

I've been standin' here waitin', mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Sayin' he's returning' home to me

See the tears standin' in my eyes
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leavin' me a card or a letter
