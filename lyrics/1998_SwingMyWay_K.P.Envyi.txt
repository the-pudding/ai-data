Oh, yeah, oh, hmm
Oh

[Chorus: Envyi]
Shawty, swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please swing my way
Shawty, swing my way

[Verse 1: K.P.]
I stepped off in the club on a Friday night
Lookin' for a man that'll do me right
First move that I made was on the dance floor
Broke it down one time then I went for mo'
Physical action, was having that
Saw this young playa dip through the crowd
Looked over to my left and told my girl, "Hey
If I see him again, I'ma have to say"

[Chorus: Envyi, K.P.]
Shawty, swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please swing my way
Shawty, swing my way
(Swing it over here, shawty)
Shawty, swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please swing my way
Shawty, swing my way

I got off the floor tryna find this man
Lookin' all around, doing all I can, damn
He sure look (Fine)
By the end of the night he's gonna be (Mine)
I thought to myself, he couldn't've gone far
Then I saw him again standing by the bar
So far everything is going my way
Now that I found him, I'ma have to say

[Chorus: Envyi]
Shawty, swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please swing my way
Shawty, swing my way

[Verse 3: K.P. | K.P. & Envyi]
Gotta get up the nerve to get my swerve on
Gotta do it fast or he'll be gone
'Cause of the beat, just my luck
That somebody else'll scoop him up
Can't have that, wanna be that girl that
Find herself a perfect match
Didn't wanna come off as bein' too fly
Got contact eye-to-eye
Then I walked over to him slowly
Said, "I know you don't know me
But this might be my only shot at a tenderoni"
He told me that, "We can do this
'Cause a girl like you I can't resist"
Got straight to the point, no time to play
Didn't need no game, just had to say
[Chorus: Envyi, K.P.]
Shawty, swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please swing my way
Shawty, swing my way
(Swing it over here, shawty)
Shawty, swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please swing my way
Shawty, swing my way

[Bridge: Envyi]
I'll hold you tight all through the night
Anything that you want, I'll keep it crunk
Boy, you're gonna see how good it can be
Just come to me, ah
I'll hold you tight all through the night
Anything that you want, I'll keep it crunk
Boy, you're gonna see how good it can be
Just come to me, ah

[Chorus: Envyi, K.P.]
Shawty, swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please swing my way
Shawty, swing my way
(Swing it over here, shawty)
[Refrain: K.P.]
You're lookin' good, shawty, good
Sho'nuff good enough for me
You're lookin' good, shawty, good
Sho'nuff good enough for me
You're lookin' good, shawty, good
Sho'nuff good enough for me
You're lookin' good, shawty
So swing it over to me

[Outro: Envyi]
I've been watching you from across the room
I wanna know your name
Would you swing my way
Shawty, come my way
Swing my way, oh
Swing my way, swing my way
Swing my way, shawty, oh, yeah2Embed
