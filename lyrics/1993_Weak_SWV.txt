I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I want to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

[Verse 2]
Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone

With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you, ohh

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

[Bridge]
I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love's so sweet
Knocks me off my feet

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
[Verse 3]
(I get so weak)
Blood starts racing through my veins
(I get so weak)
Boy, it's something I can't explain
(I get so weak)
Something 'bout the way you do
The things you do, it
(Knocks me right off of my feet)
Ohh, off my feet, I
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amazing)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (I want you to stay)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet (Ohh, I)
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak46Embed
