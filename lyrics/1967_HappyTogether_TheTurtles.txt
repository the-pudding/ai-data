[Verse 1]
Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love and hold her tight
So happy together

[Verse 2]
If I should call you up, invest a dime (Call you up)
And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind (Ease my mind)
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine (Very fine)
So happy together

[Chorus]
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life

[Verse 3]
Me and you, and you and me (You and me)
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be (It had to be)
The only one for me is you, and you for me (You for me)
So happy together
