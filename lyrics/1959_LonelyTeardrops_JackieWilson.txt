Shooby Doo Wop ba baa (Hey hey)
Shooby Doo Wop ba baa (Hey hey)

My heart Is cryin', cryin'
Lonely teardrops
My pillows never dry of
Lonely teardrops

Come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will (Say you will)
Say you will (Say you will)
Hey, Hey (Say you will)
My heart Is cryin', cryin'
Lonely teardrops
My pillows never dry of
Lonely teardrops

Come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will (Say you will)
Say you will (Say you will)
Hey, Hey (Say you will)

Just give me another chance
For our romance
Come on and tell me
That one day you'll return
'Cause everyday that you've been gone away
You'll know my heart does nothing but burn
