4 ContributorsDay Nâ€™ Nite Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Day and night (What, what)
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind (What, what)
I look for peace but see I don't attain (What, what)
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, game we play
Now look at this (What, what)
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me (What, what)
I try to run but see I'm not that fast (What, what)
I think I'm first but surely finish last, finish last

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
At, at, at, at, at, at night
At, at, at, at, at, at night

[Verse 2]
Hold the phone (What, what)
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Doe Low (What, what)
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade (What, what)
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep (What, what)
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep (What, what)
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too (What, what)
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
At, at, at, at, at, at night
At, at, at, at, at, at night
At, at, at, at, at, at night
At, at, at, at, at, at nightEmbed
