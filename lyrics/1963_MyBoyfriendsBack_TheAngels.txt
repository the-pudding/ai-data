He went away, and you hung around
And bothered me every night
And when I wouldn't go out with you
You said things that weren't very nice

[Verse 1]
My boyfriend's back, and you're gonna be in trouble
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)
When you see him comin' better cut out on the double
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)

[Verse 2]
You been spreading lies that I was untrue
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)
So, look out now cause he's comin' after you
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)

[Chorus]
(Hey, he knows that you been tryin'
And he knows that you been lyin')

[Verse 3]
He's been gone for such a long time
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)
Now, he's back and things'll be fine
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)

You're gonna be sorry you were ever born
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)
'Cause he's kinda big, and he's awful strong
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)

[Chorus]
(Hey, he knows I wasn't cheatin'
Now, you're gonna get a beatin')

[Bridge]
(What made you think he'd believe all your lies?
Wah-ooh, wah-ooh
You're a big man now but he'll cut you down to size
Wah-ooh, wait and see)

[Verse 5]
My boyfriend's back, he's gonna save my reputation
(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend's back)
If I were you I'd take a permanent vacation
(Hey-la-day-la, my boyfriend's back)

[Outro]
Yeah, my boyfriend's back
(La-day-la, my boyfriend's back)
Well, look out now, my boyfriend's back
(La-day-la, my boyfriend's back)
Well, I can see him comin'
(La-day-la, my boyfriend's back)
So, you better get a-runnin'
(La-day-la, my boyfriend's back)
Alright now
(La-day-la, my boyfriend's back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(La-day-la, my boyfriends's back)
My boyfriend's back, now
(La-day-la, my boyfriend's back)
