27 ContributorsRunaround Sue Lyrics[Intro]
Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love, then ran around
With every single guy in town

[Chorus]
(Hape-hape, bum-da-hey-di-hey-di)
(Hape-hape, bum-da-hey-di-hey-di)
(Hape-hape, bum-da-hey-di-hey-di, hape)
(Hape-hape, bum-da-hey-di-hey-di)
(Hape-hape, bum-da-hey-di-hey-di)
(Hape-hape, bum-da-hey-di-hey-di, hape)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now, listen people what I'm tellin' you
I'd keep away from a Runaround Sue, yeah

[Verse 2]
I might miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So, if you don't wanna cry like I do
I'd keep away from a Runaround Sue
