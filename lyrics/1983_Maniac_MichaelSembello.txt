Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[Chorus 1]
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Verse 2]
On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

[Chorus 2]
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Bridge]
Ooh, oh
Oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[Chorus 2]
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before21Embed
