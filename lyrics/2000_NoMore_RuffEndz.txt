Ooh, girl, oh, girl
No more, no more
Bounce, baby, bounce, baby
You can move, uh
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Baby, relax, sit back and chill (Yeah)
Just give me a second and let me tell you how I feel
'Cause all around town you've been steppin' out
Runnin' your mouth about
What made you think I wouldn't find out?
Wasn't I there for you? Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good, now the love is gone
And went back to your hood with the 5411's on

[Pre-Chorus]
Does he lace you with the finer things? (Does he?)
Does he make you wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone (Should've told me, baby)
Never thought that you'd do me wrong (Mmm)
Girl, I thought that your love was strong
'Til I saw you in another man's arms
You might also like[Chorus]
No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps (No, no more)
No more VIP, no more dough
We can't even kick it no more (Kick it, no)
No more shopping sprees (Sprees)
No more late night creeps (Creeps)
No more VIP, no more dough
We can't even kick it no more

[Verse 2]
I saw you on the ave' and I laughed
In the backseat, be spilling Henney in his lap
Thought it was me that you was all about
But I'm havin' doubts 'cause I see you tryna play me out
But when the brother called the crib with beef
Didn't I represent you when I caught him in the streets?
So let me get the keys to Lex and no more checks
And no more hangin' baguettes around your neck, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Does he lace you with the finer things? (Mmm)
Does he make you wanna scream his name? (Yeah)
Does he hit it from the front to back? (Oh)
Did you let him break it down like that? (Ooh)
Should've told me the love was gone
Never thought that you'd do me wrong
Girl, I thought that your love was strong (Baby)
'Til I saw you in another man's arms (No more)
[Chorus]
No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps
No more VIP, no more dough
We can't even kick it no more (Can't even kick it no more, baby)
No more shopping sprees (Sprees) (Mmm)
No more late night creeps (Creeps) (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No more VIP, no more dough
We can't even kick it no more (We can't, mmm-mmm, woo)

[Chorus]
No more shopping sprees (No more, no more, no more)
No more late night creeps (No more, no more)
No more VIP, no more dough (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We can't even kick it no more (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No more shopping sprees (Sprees)
No more late night creeps (Creeps)
No more VIP, no more dough
We can't even kick it no more (We can't even kick it no more)
