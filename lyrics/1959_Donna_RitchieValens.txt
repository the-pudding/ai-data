14 ContributorsDonna Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna

[Verse 1]
I had a girl
Donna was her name
Since she left me
I've never been the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be?
Where can you be?

[Verse 2]
Now, that you're gone
I'm left all alone
All by myself
To wander and roam

[Chorus]
'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be?
Where can you be?
You might also like[Bridge]
Well, darlin', now that you're gone
I don't know what I'll do
All time and all my love
For you

[Verse 1]
I had a girl
Donna was her name
Since she left me
I've never been the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be?
Where can you be?

[Outro]
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
Oh, Donna
