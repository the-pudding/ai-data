Freeze-frame

[Verse 1]
I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound

[Verse 2]
Thursday morning was a hot flash factor
Her face still focused in my mind (Deedle-deedle-dee)
Test-strip proof-sheet love is hard to find (Deedle-deedle-dee)
Friday night, we'll dance the spotlight grind (Deedle-deedle-dee)
Stop-time heart for me if she's not mine

[Chorus]
(Freeze-frame) Freeze-frame
(Freeze-frame) Freeze-frame
(Freeze-frame) Freeze-frame
(Freeze-frame, woo) Now freeze

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lookin' at a flashback Sunday
Zoom-lens feelings just won't disappear (Deedle-deedle-dee)
Close-up darkroom sweet talk in my ear (Deedle-deedle-dee)
Her hotspot love for me is strong (Deedle-deedle-dee)
This freeze-frame moment can't be wrong
You might also like[Chorus]
(Freeze-frame) Freeze-frame
(Freeze-frame) Freeze-frame
(Freeze-frame) Freeze-frame
(Freeze-frame, woo) Now freeze

[Bridge]
Shoot, shoot, deedle-deedle-dee
Shoot, shoot, deedle-deedle-dee
Shoot, shoot, deedle-deedle-dee

[Chorus]
(Freeze-frame) Freeze-frame
(Freeze-frame) Freeze-frame
(Freeze-frame) Freeze-frame
(Freeze-frame, woo) Now freeze, ah

[Outro]
Yeah
Freeze-frame (Yeah, yeah)
Freeze-frame
It's like a freeze-frame (Freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame
It's like a freeze, freeze, freeze, woo (Shoot, shoot, deedle-deedle-dee)
Freeze-frame
It's like a freeze, freeze, ow (Shoot, shoot, deedle-deedle-dee)
Freeze-frame
Shoot, shoot, deedle-deedle-dee
Freeze-frame
Shoot, shoot, deedle-deedle-dee
