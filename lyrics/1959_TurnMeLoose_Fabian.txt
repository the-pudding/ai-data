This is the first time I have felt this way
Gonna get a thousand kicks or kiss a thousand chicks
So turn me loose

Turn me loose, turn me loose I say
Gonna rock'n'roll long as the band's gonna play
Gonna holler, gonna shout, gonna knock myself right out
So turn me loose (turn me loose, ooh-ahh)

I've got some change in my pocket and I'm rarin' to go
Takin' some chick-a to the picture show
And when I see her home and we kiss goodnight
Well, turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose

Turn me loose, turn me loose I say
Yes, today is gonna, is gonna be the day
I want you all to understand, now I am a man
So turn me loose (turn me loose, ooh-ahh)

I've got some change in my pocket and I'm rarin' to go
Takin' some chick-a to the picture show
And when I see her home and we kiss goodnight
Well, turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose

Turn me loose, turn me loose I say
Yes, today is gonna, is gonna be the day
I want you all to understand, now I am a man
So turn me loose (turn me loose, ooh-ahh)You might also likeEmbed
