6 ContributorsOn The Dark Side Lyrics[Verse 1]
The dark side's callin' now
Nothin' is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows
She walks like a dream
Makes me feel crazy
Makes me feel so mean

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't nothin' gonna save you
From a love that's blind
You slip to the dark side
Across that line

[Chorus]
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
