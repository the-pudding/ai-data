5 ContributorsTwo Faces Have I LyricsI don't want the world to know
I don't want my heart to show
Two faces have I
I pretend that I'm happy
But I'm Mr. blue
I pretend that I'm happy
Since I lost you
Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cry
Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cry
Will I ever laugh again
She'll never see me cry
Will I walk with a smile on my face
Kniowing I live a lie
I pretend that I'm carefree
But what am I
I pretend that I'm carefree
But I'm living a lie
Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cry
Two faces have I
One to laugh and one to cryYou might also likeEmbed
