14 ContributorsIâ€™d Love You To Want Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I saw you standing there
I 'bout fell out my chair
And when you moved your mouth to speak
I felt the blood go to my feet
Now, it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cried
I see the want in your blue eyes

[Chorus]
Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be

[Verse 2]
You told yourself years ago
You'd never let your feelings show
The obligation that you've made
For the title that they gave

[Chorus]
Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be
You might also like[Verse 3]
Now, it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cried
I see the want in your blue eyes

[Chorus]
Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be (Oh)
Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be1Embed
