11 ContributorsOn the Radio Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered too
If, by chance, you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

[Chorus]
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Now, now, don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, it kinda made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air
You might also like[Chorus]
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio

[Verse 3]
If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud, they said it really loud

[Chorus]
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
