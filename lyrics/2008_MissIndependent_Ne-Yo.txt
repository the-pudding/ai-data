Ooh, it's something about
Just something about the way she move
I can't figure it out
It's something about her
Said, ooh, it's something about
Kind of woman that want you, but don't need you
Hey, I can't figure it out
It's something about her

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she walk like a boss, talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss, do what a boss do
She got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need, oh

Car and a crib, she 'bout to pay 'em both off
And her bills are paid on time, yeah
