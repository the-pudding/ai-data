When you left me all alone at the record hop
Told me you were going out for a soda pop
You were gone for quite a while, half an hour or more
You came back and man, oh man, this is what I saw

[Chorus]
Lipstick on your collar told a tale on you
Lipstick on your collar said you were untrue
Bet your bottom dollar, you and I are through
'Cause lipstick on your collar told a tale on you, yeah

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
You said it belonged to me, made me stop and think
And then I noticed yours was red, mine was baby pink
Who walked in but Mary Jane, lipstick all a mess
Were you smoochin' my best friend? Guess the answer's yes

[Chorus]
Lipstick on your collar told a tale on you
Lipstick on your collar said you were untrue
Bet your bottom dollar, you and I are through
Cause lipstick on your collar told a tale on you, boy
Told a tale on you, man
Told a tale on you, yeah
Told a tale on youYou might also likeEmbed
