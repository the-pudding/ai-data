Let me know
Let me know
Haah, haaaah, let me know, let me know
Let me know

[Verse 1]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know
There are times when I'll find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see, yeah

[Chorus]
But at your best, you are love, yes
You're a positive, motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why?
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me, yeah

[Verse 2]
When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
I'm all about, all about
You might also like[Chorus]
But at your best, you are love, yes
You're a positive, motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why?
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Bridge]
Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
Make believe, no need to make believe
Look beyond your own (Look beyond your own)
Try to find a place for me (Try and find, find a place for me)
'Cause

[Chorus]
At your best, you are love
You're a positive, motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why?
Let me know, let me know

[Outro]
Let me know
Let me know, let me know
Oh
See, stay at your best, baby39Embed
