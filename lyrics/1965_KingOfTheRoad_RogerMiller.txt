Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushing broom
Buys a eight by twelve four-bit room

[Refrain]
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road

[Verse 2]
Third boxcar, midnight train
Destination: Bangor, Maine
Old worn-out suit and shoes
I don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found
Short but not too big around

[Refrain]
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road

[Bridge]
I know every engineer on every train
All of the children and all of their names
And every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no one's around

I sing, trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushing broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room

[Refrain]
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road

[Outro]
Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushing broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room8Embed
