7 ContributorsWhat The World Needs Now Is Love/Abraham, Martin And John Lyrics[Intro: Adult & Child]
What is segregation?
I don't know what seggeration is
What is bigotry?
I don't know what biggery is
What does hatred mean?
I don't know what that is
What is prejudice?
Hmm, I think its when someones sick

Rise and shine, boys!
One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four!

Get your head up
Two
Lower your shoulders down
Three
Get your heads up
Four
Lower your shoulders down
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four

I don't know what I believe
I don't know what I believe
I'll be on my Christmas leave
I'll be on my Christmas leave
Sound off
One, two
Sound off
Three, four
South off
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four

Anybody here, seen my old friend John
Can you tell me where he's gone?

[Radio Exert: 1]
Were at the Trademark, the motorcade is coming by here, I can see many many motorcycles coming by now, police motorcycles. Just heard a call on the radio for all units along Industrial, to pick up the
Motorcade. Somethings happened here, we understand there has been a shooting. The Presidential car coming up now, we know it's the presidential car. We can see Mrs. Kennedy's pink suit, there's a Secret Service man spread eagle over the top of the car. We understand governor and Mrs. Connolly are in the car with President and Mrs. Kennedy. We can't see who has been hit if anybody's been hit, but apparently something is wrong here. Something is terribly wrong. I am behind the motorcade now, and as you probably notice they're going to Parkland Hospital

[Radio Exert 2]
We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin: Dallas Texas, the flash, apparently official:
President John F. Kennedy died, at 1 p.m., central standard time

[Verse 2]
Anybody here, seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me where he's gone?

[Radio Exert 3]
We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't really matter
With me now. Because I've been to the Mountain top, and I mind. Like anybody I would like to live

[Radio Exert 4]
No one can be certain who next will suffer from senseless act of bloodshed

[Verse 3]
Anybody here seen my old Bobby
Can you tell me where he's gone?
[Radio Exert 5]
Mayor [?] has just send me a message that we've been here too long already. So uh, my thanks to all of you and now it's onto Chicago and lets win this. Thank you

[Radio Exert 6]
Senator Kennedy has been, Senator Kennedy has been shot. Is that possible? Oh my God Senator Kennedy has been shot. [?] Johnson has a hold of the man who apparently has fired the shot. Get the gun, get the gun, get the gun, stay away from the gun. His hand is frozen. Take a hold of his thumb and break it if you have to. Get his thumb alright. That's right rapper, get the gun rapper. Hold him, hold him. We don't want another Oswald

[Radio Exert 7]
Like it or not we live in ties of uncertainty. That is the way he lived, that is what he leaves us. My brother need not be idolized, or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life. Be remember simply as a good and decent man. Saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it. This whole war he tried to stop. Those of us who loved him, and who take him to his rest today. Pray that what he was to us, what he wished for others, will someday come to pass for all the world. As he said many times, in many parts of this nation. Those he touched and who saw to touch him. Some men see things as they are and say why, I dream things that never were and say why not

[Verse 4]
What the world needs now
Is love sweet love
No not just for some but for everyone
