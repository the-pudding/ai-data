He rocks in the treetop all the day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' his song
All the little birds on Jay Bird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin (tweet tweet tweet)
Rock, rock, rockin' robin (Tweet, tweedle-lee-dee)
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight, yeah

Every little swallow, every chickadee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flap-a their wings singin' "go bird go"

Rockin' robin (tweet tweet tweet)
Rock, rock, rockin' robin (Tweet, tweedle-lee-dee)
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Blow!

Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started goin' steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

He rocks in the treetop all the day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' his song
All the little birds on Jay Bird Street

Well, the pretty little raven at the bird bandstand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started goin' steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

He rocks in the treetop all the day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' his song
