I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Though, oh, oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly

[Chorus]
You've really got a hold on me
(You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

[Verse 2]
I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Though, oh, oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

[Chorus]
You've really got a hold on me
(You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby
You might also like[Bridge]
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter
Tighter

[Verse 3]
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Though, oh, oh, I want to split now
I can't quit now

[Chorus]
You've really got a hold on me
(You've really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

[Bridge]
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, please (Hold me)
Squeeze, hold me
(Hold me, hold me)

[Outro]
You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
I said you've really got a hold on me
(I said you've really got a hold on me)
Ya know, you've really got hold on me
(Oh, really got a hold on me)
You know, you've really got hold on me
(Oh, really got a hold on me)
I said you've really got a hold on me
(I said you've really hold on me)2Embed
