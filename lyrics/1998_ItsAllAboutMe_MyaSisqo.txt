12 ContributorsIt’s All About Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Mýa]
I cook your dinner
I wash your clothes
Baby hell no that's not the way it goes
It's all about me tonight
I ain't stop loving you
Cause you still my boo
You still my boo
But you gotta see tonight it's all about me, me, me, me, me

[Chorus]
Tonight it's 'bout me, me, me, me, me
Forget about you, you, you, you ,you
So what you gonna do, do, do, do, do?
Are you gonna get it up?, get it up?

[Verse 2: Mýa]
Up jumps my butt, nigga what?
Look at your eyes looking at my thighs
Now swing my body right to left
You know that shit is tight

Now just look at my body (body)
Uh-huh
And just hold me like a man should
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Sisqó]
Like a nigga should
'Cause baby you gotta see
Tonight, baby
It's all about me

[Chorus: Mya & Sisqó]
Tonight it's 'bout me, me, me, me, me
Forget about you, you, you, you ,you

My arms are open wide
So let me come inside

[Chorus: Mya & Sisqó]
Tonight it's 'bout me, me, me, me, me
Forget about you, you, you, you ,you
So what you gonna do, do, do, do, do?
