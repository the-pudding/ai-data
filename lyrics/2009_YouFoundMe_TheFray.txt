53 ContributorsYou Found Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
We're all alone
Smokin' his last cigarette
I said, "Where you been?"
He said, "Ask anything"
Where were you
When everything was fallin' apart?
Where all my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Well, in the end
Everyone ends up alone
But losin' her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Bridge]
Early mornin'
The city breaks
But I've been callin'
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kinda nerve
Takin' all I want
[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Outro]
Why'd you have to wait
To find me? To find me?45Embed
