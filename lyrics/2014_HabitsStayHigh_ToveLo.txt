100 ContributorsHabits (Stay High) Lyrics[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, dazed and kinda lonely

[Chorus]
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missin' you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my day time
Loosen up their frown, make 'em feel alive
I make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy
You might also like[Chorus]
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missin' you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end, oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain, oh
Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain

[Chorus]
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life, to forget I'm missin' you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Outro]
