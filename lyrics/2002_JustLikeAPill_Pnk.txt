I'm lyin' here on the floor where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm cryin' here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's bein' a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here

[Chorus]
Where I can run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

[Verse 2]
I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills
They were different
Maybe I should get some help

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's bein' a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here

[Chorus]
Where I can run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch (Just like a pill)
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch (Just like a pill)
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's bein' a little bitch (Just like a pill)
I think I'll get outta here
[Chorus]
Where I can run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears (Frustrated fears, I swear)
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me...
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill (You're makin' me, makin me ill)
You keep making me...
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere (Ah)
To the middle of my frustrated fears (Yeah)
And I swear, you're just like a pill (Yeah)
Instead of making me better (Oh-oh)
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill (Oh, you're making me run)
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear12Embed
