38 ContributorsButtons (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
What it do, baby boo?

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, lil' mama, you lookin' good
I see you wanna play with a player from the hood
Come holla at me, you got it like that
Big Snoop Dogg with the lead Pussycat
I show you how it go down, yeah, I wanna throw down
Me and you one-on-one, treat it like a showdown
You look at me and I look at you
I'm reachin' for your shirt, whatchu want me to do?

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm tellin' you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep frontin', uh
Sayin' what you're gon' do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothin'
I'm tellin' you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep frontin', uh
Sayin' what you're gon' do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothin'

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
Typical ain't hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical
Don't leave me askin' for more
I'm a sexy mama (Mama)
Who knows just how to get what I wanna (Wanna)
What I wanna do is spring this on ya (On ya)
Back up all of the things that I told ya (Told ya, told ya, told ya)
You been sayin' all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off

[Verse 3: Nicole Scherzinger]
You say you're a big boy, but I can't agree
'Cause the love you said you had ain't been put on me
I wonder (Wonder) if I'm just too much for you
Wonder (Wonder) if my kiss don't make you just
Wonder (Wonder), what I got next for you
What you wanna do? (Do)
Take the chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see just like most guys that your game don't, please
