When people keep repeatin'
That you'll never fall in love
When everybody keeps retreatin'
But you can't seem to get enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
To your heart

[Chorus]
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door

[Verse 2]
When everything feels all over
Everybody seems unkind
I'll give you a four-leaf clover
Take all worry out of your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
To your heart
You might also like[Chorus]
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door

[Bridge]
I have the only key to your heart
I can stop you fallin' apart
Try today, you'll find this way
Come on and give me a chance to say

Let my love open the door, it's all I'm livin' for
Release yourself from misery
There's only one thing
Gonna set you free
That's my love, that's my love

[Pre-Chorus]
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door

[Verse 3]
When tragedy befalls you
Don't let it drag you down
Love can cure your problems
You're so lucky I'm around
[Pre-Chorus]
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
To your heart
