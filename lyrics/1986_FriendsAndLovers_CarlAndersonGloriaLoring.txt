5 ContributorsFriends & Lovers LyricsWhat would you think if I told you
I've always wanted to hold you?
I don't know what we're afraid of
Nothing would change if we made love

[Chorus]
So I'll be your friend
And I'll be your lover
'Cause, I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other
Oh no, we could be both to each other

Yes, it's a chance that we're taking
And somebody's heart may be breaking
But we can't stop what's inside us
Our love for each other will guide us

[Chorus]
So I'll be your friend
And I'll be your lover
'Cause, I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other

I've been through you
And you've been through me
Sometimes a friend is the hardest to see
We always know when it's laid on the line
Nobody else is as easy to find
You might also like[Chorus]
So I'll be your friend
And I'll be your lover
Well, I know in our heart we agree
We don't have to be one or the other
