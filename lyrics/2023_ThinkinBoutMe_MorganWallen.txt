12 ContributorsThinkinâ€™ Bout Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't know where you at, don't know where you've been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

[Chorus]
When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

[Verse 2]
Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't

When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

[Bridge]
Don't know where you at
But girl, I know where you oughta be

[Chorus]
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Yeah, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout me?Embed
