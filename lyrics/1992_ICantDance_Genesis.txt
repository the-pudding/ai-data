Hot sun beating down
Burning my feet just walking around
Hot sun making me sweat
Gator's getting close, hasn't got me yet

[Chorus]
I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

[Verse 2]
Blue jeans sitting on the beach
Her dog's talking to me, but she's out of reach
She's got a body under that shirt
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standin' here selling

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on
You might also like[Verse 3]
Young punk spilling beer on my shoes
Fat guys talking to me try to steal my blues
Thick smoke, see her smiling through
I never thought so much could happen just shootin' pool

[Chorus]
But I can't dance, I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on
A perfect body with a perfect face, mhm

[Chorus]
No, I can't dance, I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way I walk
No, I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

[Outro]
But I can walk
No, I can't dance
No-no-no, I can't dance
No, I said I can't sing
But I can walk5Embed
