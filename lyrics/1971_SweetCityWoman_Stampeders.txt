Well, I'm on my way to the city lights
To the pretty face that shines her light on the city nights
And I gotta catch a noon train, I gotta be there on time
Oh, it feels so good to know she waits at the end of the line

[Chorus]
Sweet, sweet city woman
I can see your face, I can hear your voice, I can almost touch you
Sweet, sweet city woman
Oh, my banjo and me, we got a feel for singin', yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Bon, c'est bon, bon, bon, c'est bon, bon
Bon, c'est bon, bon, bon, bon, bon
Bon, c'est bon, bon, bon, c'est bon, bon
Bon, c'est bon, bon, bon, bon, bon
So long, ma, so long, pa
So long, neighbors and friends

[Verse 2]
Like a country mornin' all smothered in dew
Ah, she's got a way to make a man feel shiny and new
And she'll sing in the evenin' old familiar tunes
And she feeds me love and tenderness and macaroons
You might also like[Chorus]
Sweet, sweet city woman
I can see your face, I can hear your voice, I can almost touch you
Sweet, sweet city woman
Oh, my banjo and me, we got a feel for singin'
