Huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]
If it wasn't for the money, cars, and movie stars, and jewels
And all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me? (Want you)
Would you still be calling me? (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Wanna keep you fly with no dough
Pimpin ain't easy, trust me, I know
But gangstas and hoes
Go, go, go, go, go together
Like chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, cheddar and glamorous things
Copped a few cars, a crib with a east and west wing
'Cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on our weakness
It's the power of P-U-S-S-Y, got a lotta niggas wonderin', it ain't just I
Gotta keep the cash comin' and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got, shit
She probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy
Sip Seraphim, who doesn't like me?
And the murderous I-N-C
See Ja Rule LiveGet tickets as low as $328You might also like[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]
If it wasn't for the money, cars, and movie stars, and jewels
And all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me? (Want you)
Would you still be calling me? (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
But how many girls does it take to get to
Mack status? Player status?
Pimps that get
Ya boy half rich 'fore we hit show biz
But show biz brought next level chicks
Pull up in them hot cars, go and buy the whole bar, nigga
I came from the dirt, what you want me to say?
I'm at the top of the world and life's a pussy buffet (hey)
And that's why I get M-I-A (Oh)
Shut the game down so the bustas can't play (Oh)
Hell yeah, I splurge money
Hell yeah, I act funny
Look at you like, "Fuck you"
All the shit I been through
It's a wonder why I'm still here ('Cause)
Said I was gone but I'm still here ('Cause)
And all you bitches that left me here (Oh)
It's mighty strange how you right back here (Oh, oh, oh)
[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]
If it wasn't for the money, cars, and movie stars, and jewels
And all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me? (Want you)
Would you still be calling me? (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Ja Rule & R. Kelly]
I wonder why love is about money
And why you wanna take it all from me, honey
My life is dark but it's lovely
Crimes, cars, cribs, ain't that right, Kelly? (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Y'all bitches don't know
Money ain't a thang
Mami need a lil' change, girl, I'm pitchin' quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New Benzes, new Porsches
New cases, new lawyers
I'm becoming the infamous notorious Rule
Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggas don't possess the heart that I do
And it's a wonder that I'm still here ('Cause)
Thought I was gone but I'm still here ('Cause)
And all you bitches that left me here (Oh)
It's kinda funny how you right back there (Oh, oh, oh)
[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]
If it wasn't for the money, cars, and movie stars, and jewels
And all these things I've got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me? (Want you)
Would you still be calling me? (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: R. Kelly]

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
