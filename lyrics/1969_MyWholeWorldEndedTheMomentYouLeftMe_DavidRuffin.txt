10 ContributorsMy Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me) Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm-hmm

[Verse 1]
Last week my life had meaning
It was beautiful and so sweet
But now it's nothing, nothing without you, baby
My whole world is incomplete

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause honey, I can't see you no more
That was all that you said, baby
But you just might as well have
Placed a gun to my head
Baby, baby, oh, why did you do it?

[Chorus]
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Oh, yes it did, honey (Yeah, baby)
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground, baby (Yeah, baby)
Ooh, baby

[Verse 2]
Did you ever mean those sweet things
Ah, that you used to say, did you mean 'em baby?
Of a house with a lovely, a lovely garden
And a little baby someday
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, tell me, baby
Where did I go wrong, honey
Whatever changed your mind, baby (What changed your mind?)
I've asked myself these questions (Asked these questions)
Over a million times
Baby, baby, oh, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

[Chorus]
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Oh, yes it did, baby, baby (Yeah, baby)
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground, baby (Yeah, baby)

[Bridge]
Baby, baby
Ooh, babe

[Verse 3]
Oh baby, now my body is numb (Now my body is numb)
I feel, feel so senseless to the touch (Ooh, baby)
My life is so wasted, so wasted without you (My life is so wasted)
I guess I loved you much too much (Ooh, baby)
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, how can I face tomorrow (How can I face it?)
When yesterday is all I see? (That's all I see)
I just don't want to face tomorrow, honey (Don't wanna face it)
If you're not sharing it with me
Baby, baby, oh, tell me why (Baby, baby, baby)

[Chorus]
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Oh, yes it did, baby, baby (Yeah, baby)
My whole world ended
The moment you left me, it tumbled down to the ground, baby (Yeah, baby)

I keep holding on, keep holding on
Although your love is gone, babyEmbed
