31 ContributorsLove In This Club Lyrics[Intro: Usher]
Gotta do it for the ladies
And I gotta keep it hood
Where we at, Polow? (Hey)
I see you, Ryan
Yo, Keith, you was right
But we just getting started
Yeah, man

[Verse 1: Usher]
You say you're searchin' for somebody that'll take you out and do you right
Well, come here, baby and let Daddy show you what it feel like
You know all you gotta do is tell me what you're sippin' on
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it comin' all night long

[Pre-Chorus 1: Usher]
Lookin' in your eyes while you on the other side
And I think that, shawty, I got a thing for you
Doin' it on purpose, windin' and workin' it
I can tell by the way you're lookin' at me, girl

[Chorus: Usher]
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)

You got some friends rollin' with you, baby, then that's cool
You can leave them with my homies, let them know that I got you
If you didn't know, you're the only thing that's on my mind
'Cause the way I'm starin' at you got me wanna give it to you all night

[Pre-Chorus 2: Usher]
Looking in your eyes while you on the other side
I can't take it no more, baby, I'm comin' for you
You keep doin' it on purpose, windin' and workin'
If we close our eyes, it could just be me and you

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I'm what you want, I'm what you need
He got you trapped, I'll set you free
Sexually, mentally, physically, emotionally
I'll be like your medicine, you'll take every dose of me
It's goin' down on aisle three, I'll bag you like some groceries
And every time you think about it, you gon' want some more of me
'Bout to hit the club, make a movie, yeah, rated R
Pulled up like a trap star, that's if you had your regular car
You ever made love to a thug in the club with his ice on?
87 Jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes on
On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom
Yeah, you know I'm trained to go

[Bridge: Usher]
Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touchin' like this
I know you're scared, baby, they don't know what we doin'
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop
And I don't care who's watchin'
Watchin', watchin'
In this club, on the floor
Baby, let's make love
[Chorus: Usher]
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)18Embed
