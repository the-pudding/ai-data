65 ContributorsDonâ€™t You (Forget About Me) Lyrics[Refrain]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh, woah

[Verse 1]
Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out and
Love's strange, so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

[Chorus]
Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

[Post-Chorus]
Will you stand above me?
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down
Will you recognize me?
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down, down

Ooh, whoa

[Verse 2]
Don't you try and pretend
It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses
Vanity and security, ah
Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Goin' to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

[Chorus]
Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

[Bridge]
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
When you walk away
Or will you walk away?
Will you walk on by?
Come on, call my name
Will you call my name?
[Outro]
I say, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
When you walk on by
And you call my name
When you walk on by36Embed
