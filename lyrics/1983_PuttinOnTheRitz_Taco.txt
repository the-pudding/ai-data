If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz
Different types who wear a day-coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway-coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the Ritz

[Chorus]
Dressed up like a million-dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (Super-duper)
Come, let's mix where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts
Puttin' on the Ritz

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the well-to-do
Up and down Park Avenue?
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air
High hats and Arrow collars
White spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime for a wonderful time

[Verse 3]
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz
Different types who wear a day-coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway-coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the Ritz

Dressed up like a million-dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (Super-duper)
Come, let's mix where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts
Puttin' on the Ritz

[Chorus]
Dressed up like a million-dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (Super-duper)
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz

[Post-Chorus]
Downtown, uptown
Get your kicks at the Ritz

[Bridge]
Dine and wine, but not 'til nine
The time is right for us tonight
We can move, move to the rhythm
We can move, dance to the rhytm
Nice and easy, I want you to move
Put it on, puttin' it on, puttin' it on, puttin' it on
The R-I-T-Z, how about you and me says—
[Interlude]
Gotta dance
Gotta dance

[Outro]
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz9Embed
