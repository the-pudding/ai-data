(Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
(Doo-lang-doo-lang)

[Verse 1]
He's so fine (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
Wish he were mine (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
That handsome boy over there (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
The one with the wavy hair (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
I don't know how I'm gonna do it (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
But, I'm gonna make him mine (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
He's the envy of all the girls (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
It's just a matter of time (Doo-lang-doo-lang)

[Verse 2]
He's a soft-spoken guy (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
Also, seems kinda shy (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
Makes me wonder if I (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
Should even give him a try (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
But then I know he can't shy (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
He can't shy away forever (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
And, I'm gonna make him mine (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
If it takes me forever (Doo-lang-doo-lang)

[Bridge]
He's so fine (Oh, yeah)
Gotta be mine (Oh, yeah)
Sooner or later (Oh, yeah)
I hope it's not later (Oh, yeah)
We got to get together (Oh, yeah)
The sooner, the better (Oh, yeah)
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
To be held in his arms

If I were a queen (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
And,he asked me to leave my throne (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
I'd do anything that he asked (Doo-lang-doo-lang-doo-lang)
Anything to make him my own (Do-lang-do-lang-do-lang)

[Outro]
For he's so fine (So fine)
So fine (So fine)
So fine (So fine)
So fine (So fine)
So fine (So fine)
Oh, yeah (So fine)
So fine (So fine)
