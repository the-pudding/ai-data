5 ContributorsWalking Away LyricsIt is useless to resist us

Cold winds blow around me
And I can't help but think of you
All the things we wanted
All the things we had to do

Wrap yourself around me
We can steal away sometime
Your whispers surround me
But it's only in my mind

'Cause I'm walking away from
Walking away from things in my own past
Walking away from
Walking away from things that just won't last

You got what you wanted
But you can't help but think of me
All the things you wanted
All the things you got for free

One thing to remember
Is that I have feelings too
I surely would have closed my eyes
If I had known the real you
You might also like'Cause I'm walking away from
Walking away from things in my own past
Walking away from
Walking away from things that just won't last
And I'm walking away from
Walking away from things that move too fast

Let's go see
Let's go see
Let's go see
Let's, let's, let's, let's go see

Let's go see
Let's go see
Let's go see
Let's, let's, let's, let's go see

'Cause I'm walking away from
Walking away from things in my own past
Walking away from
Walking away from things that just won't last

And I'm walking away from
Walking away from things that move too fast
Walking away from
Walking away from things in my own past
Walking away from
Walking away from things in my own past
Walking away from
Walking away from things that just won't lastEmbed
