5 ContributorsBe Near Me Lyrics[Intro]
The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear
No, don't disappear

[Verse 1]
Ever had the feeling
Almost broke in two
Said that you were leaving
Like you do, you do

[Pre-Chorus]
All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears, in tears

[Chorus]
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near

[Verse 2]
Never had that feeling
Until I first met you
Never felt like kneeling
Now I do, yes, I do
Yes, I do, ooh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears, in tears

[Chorus]
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Oh, be near me, be near
Be near

[Refrain]
The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear
No, don't disappear

[Chorus]
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near

[Outro]
What's your reputation?
Ecstasy
What's your destination?
