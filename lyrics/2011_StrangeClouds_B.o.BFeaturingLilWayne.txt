95 ContributorsStrange Clouds Lyrics[Intro: B.o.B]
Yeah, eh-hahaha
Oh, you already know what we gon' do
Eh-hahaha
Hey

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well, if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly
I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian
And um, I'ma hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat, man, I beat every street
It's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me
There's no Inception in this

[Refrain: B.o.B]
Bitch, I'm top chef, you top ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call to the bartender, "What you got left?"
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate 'cause we everywhere and you not there, ha

[Chorus: B.o.B, Lil Wayne]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds (Yeah)
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do) (Haha!)
And all we do is light it up all night (Yeah, yeah)
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds

Uh, blue jeans, I'm faded, mining my own data
Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger
It's Tunechi Li, you bitch, you, you hot as a igloo
Kick back on that Glock, call that Jiu Jitsu
Hello world, I'm with a yellow girl, number two pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half-pipe
I dive in that pussy, ya, I belly flop, I jack knife

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
And shit, tell my homies that I say it's a party
Yeah, got that TEC for technical difficulties
I'm top dog, you top ramen, I'm top dog
Piru, gangsters, outlaws!

[Chorus: B.o.B & Lil Wayne]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out (Yeah!)
(That's all we do, that's all we do) (Young Mula, baby!)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
(Hahahaha) Strange clouds
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out (B.o.B. fuck with me!)
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds, strange clouds, strange clouds
[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Well, ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B, yes, definitely
Up in the studio, I got all my necessities
If you want that real shit, you made the right selection (Haha)
I'm Decatur 'til I die (Yeah), yes, I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin'
To a nigga from the hood, tryin' to aim for the top
I didn't even need no directions

[Refrain: B.o.B]
I just wake up and then I roll up the purp
But these niggas wake up on my dick
At least have some breakfast first (Hey)
Nigga, keep your nourishment first
And your mind on my lyrics
'Cause what you hopin' to accomplish
I already did it, bitch!

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we, that's all we do, hey)
And all we do is light it up (Hey) all night
All you see is strange clouds (Hey)
(Strange clouds) Strange clouds, bitch!
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (All you see is, all you see)
(Strange clouds, strange clouds, hey)35Embed
