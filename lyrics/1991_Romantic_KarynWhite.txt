5 ContributorsRomantic Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh
Baby, baby, baby
I wanna get romantic
Oh

[Chorus]
Turn the lights down
It's time to get romantic
Light a candle
It's time to get romantic
Let's be romantic

[Verse 1]
Take me in your arms, caress me gently
Oh, I can't get enough, ooh
Thrill me, say the word, I will surrender
To your poetic charm, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the night falls
I hear seductive voices sing
Romantic songs of love
Let's get intimate

[Chorus]
Turn the lights down
It's time to get romantic
Do everything romantic now
Light a candle
It's time to get romantic
The night has just begun, so baby, let's be romantic

Under the moonlight
With the stars shining so bright
Baby, my mind is on love
When we get home tonight, ooh

[Chorus]
Turn the lights down
It's time to get romantic
Do everything romantically
Light a candle
It's time to get romantic
I wanna get, I wanna get, ooh, romantic

Just you and me romantically, yeah
