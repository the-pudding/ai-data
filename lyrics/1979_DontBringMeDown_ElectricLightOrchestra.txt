One, two
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
You got me running, going out of my mind
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

[Verse 2]
You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm telling you, it's gotta be the end

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

[Post-Chorus]
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

[Verse 4]
You're always talking 'bout your crazy nights
One of these days, you're gonna get it right

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, ooh-ooh-hoo

Don't bring me down

[Post-Chorus]

Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down

You're looking good, just like a snake in the grass
One of these days, you're gonna break your glass

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor

You got me shaking, got me running away
You got me crawling up to you every day

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down, down, down, down, down, down
