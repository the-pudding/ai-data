Tell him no-oh-oh-oh
When he asks for a date
Tell him no-oh-oh-oh
Tell him no

Tell him no-oh-oh-oh
Tell him no-oh-oh-oh
When he asks for a kiss
Tell him no-oh-oh-oh
Tell him no

It's alright to go to a party
It’s alright to have some fun
It's alright to take in a movie
But don't let him be the one

Tell him no-oh-oh-oh
Tell him no-oh-oh-oh
If he offers his ring
Tell him no-oh-oh-oh
Tell him no

Did he tell you that he loved you
And did you thrill to his charms
And did you feel much more better
When he held you in his arms
