Everybody's gone away
I believe they're gone to stay
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town

[Verse 2]
Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Find the sunshine, leave the rain
They said this town will waste your time
I guess they're right, it's wastin' mine

[Chorus]
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues

[Verse 3]
Ya know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at thirty-three
Ya play around ya lose your wife
Ya play too long you lose your life

[Verse 4]
I got my pills to ease the pain
Can't find a thing to ease the rain
I'd love to try and settle down
But everybody's leavin' town
You might also like[Chorus]
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the bluesEmbed
