Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way, dig this

[Verse 1]
I got in town a month ago, I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em, but as yet I haven't met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in

[Chorus]
Here another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

[Verse 2]
Now, another fella told me he had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein

[Chorus]
Here another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful way
You might also like[Bridge]
Yeah
(Here it is, another weekend and I ain't got nobody
Man if I was back home I'd be swinging
Two chicks on my arm
Aww yeah
Listen to me, huh)

[Verse 3]
It's hard on a fella, when he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town

[Chorus]
Here it's another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful - everybody sing

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful - one more time

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful - sounding mighty good
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody1Embed
