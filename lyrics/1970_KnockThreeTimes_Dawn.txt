Dancing alone every night while I live right above you
I can hear your music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me, you don't even know me
I love you

Oh my darlin'
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Mmm, twice on the pipe if the answer is no
Oh my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Whoa, twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show

If you look out your window tonight
Pulling the string with the note that's attached to my heart
Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
And only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart

Oh my darlin'
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Mmm, twice on the pipe if the answer is no
Whoa my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Whoa, twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show
You might also likeWhoa, I can hear the music playing
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me you don't even know me
I love you

Oh my darlin'
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Whoa, twice on the pipe if the answer is no (I love you, I love you, I love you)
Oh my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Mmm, twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna showEmbed
