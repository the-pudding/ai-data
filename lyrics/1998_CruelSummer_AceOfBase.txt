10 ContributorsCruel Summer Lyrics[Intro]
Mm-mm
Ah-ah
Mm-mm
Ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning
I sit around
Trying to smile, but the air is so heavy and dry

[Verse 2]
Strange voices are saying
(Ah, what did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand

[Chorus]
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one, it's a cruel
You might also like[Verse 3]
The city is crowded
My friends are away
And I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I gotta get up and go (And go)

[Chorus]
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one, it's a cruel
Cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one, it's a cruel
(Mm-mm)

[Bridge]
Now don't you leave me
Mmm, now don't you leave me
Now don't you leave me
Come on, come on
Mmm, now don't you leave me
Mmm, now don't you leave me
Now don't you leave me
Come on, come on
[Chorus]
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer (Cruel summer)
Leaving me here on my own (Leaving me here all alone)
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer (Cruel summer)
You're not the only one, it's a cruel (The only one)
Cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one, it's a cruel
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
It's a cruel summer
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
It's a cruel summer3Embed
