1 ContributorCollaborate Lyrics"Hey whats up?
I actually been uh meaning to talk to you
I think you're really talented and...you’ve got something special!
So I wanted to know if you'd like to get together sometime and uh...try to make something happen...you down?"

"Aight word lets do it!"

Baby let's collaborate
Let’s go half on a masterpiece
I can be the Nelly to yo Kelly
Marvin to your Tammi
Ain't no mountain high enough, my darling

Baby let's collaborate
Co-create
Combinate
Co-operate, baby let's collaborate
Let's collaborate

This ain't no Bonnie and Clyde
Ride or die, girl we staying alive
Like 2 years after '75
Word to the Bee Gees
You ain't no BGV, this duet and you know that
Front and center this our Kodak Moment
You might also likePicture perfect, pitch is flawless hitting high notes
I bring the bass you compliment with that soprano
Mano e mano, I don’t even know what that mean
But it sound like a team
And we something like a dream

I could name some famous couples, but they all got they issues
But
We got harmony the closer I get to you
La di da di i’ll be Donny Hathaway, you Roberta Flack
Uh
Finna burn this track and make it timeless, timeless

Now we in sync, no baby bye bye, bye bye
"Hello" like Adele or Lionel, Lionel
Perfect couple like the guitar and piano, piano
You know what I'm sayin’ tho

Baby let's collaborate
Let's go half on a masterpiece
I can be the Nelly to yo Kelly
Marvin to your Tammi
Ain't no mountain high enough, my darling

Baby let’s collaborate

Co-operate, baby let's collaborate

Do you wanna feature
Co-star in my motion picture
True story its a documentary
From Hollywood to Broadway
Red carpet all day

Our loves deserves a Grammy, Tony and an Emmy
Billboard and an MTV
We sweep every category
Top of the charts
#1 in my heart
Smash hit a classic
What we got is magic

Something so refined
A genre can't define it
Life is but a stage
This one stellar performance

Standing ovation
The crowd goes wild
Heavy rotation
Perfect notation

I'm the orchestra
You conduct the symphony
My heart beat like a timpani
Philharmonic chemistry
I know it ain't just me
I know you feel this energy
So baby
