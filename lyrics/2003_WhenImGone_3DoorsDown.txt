There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind

[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

When your education x-ray
Cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing
That I could not tell my friends
Roaming through this darkness
I'm alive, but I'm alone
And part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone
[Refrain]
Or maybe I'm just blind

[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

[Outro]
Love me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm gone17Embed
