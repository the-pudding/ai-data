7 ContributorsThe Old Man Down the Road Lyrics[Verse 1]
He take a thunder from the mountain
He take a lightnin' from the sky
He bring a strong man to his beggin' knee
He make the young girl's mama cry

[Chorus]
You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump and run
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road

[Verse 2]
He got the voices speakin' riddle
He got the eye as black as coal
He got a suitcase covered with rattlesnake hide
And he stands right in the road

[Chorus]
You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump up, run away
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road

He make a river call your lover
He make the barkin' of the hound
Put a shadow 'cross the window
When the old man comes around

[Chorus]
You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump and run again
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road
The old man is down the road

[Outro]
Ah
You got to, you got to, you got to
Hidey-hidey-hideEmbed
