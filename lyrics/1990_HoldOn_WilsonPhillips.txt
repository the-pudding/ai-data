19 ContributorsHold On Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know this pain (I know this pain)
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains? (These chains)
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind
Is it really fair to feel this way inside?
Oh

[Chorus]
Someday, somebody's gonna make you wanna
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you gonna let them
Hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day

[Verse 2]
You could sustain (Sustain)
Or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness (No, baby)
You got yourself into your own mess (Oh)
Lettin' your worries pass you by (Lettin' your worries pass you by)
Don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind?
Ooh, no

Hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way (Things'll go your way)
Hold on for one more day

[Bridge]
I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and
Break free from the chains
Yeah, I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and you
Break free, break from the chains

[Chorus]
Someday, somebody's gonna make you wanna
Turn around and say goodbye (Say goodbye)
Until then, baby, are you gonna let them
Hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day, yeah
If you hold on
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
If you hold on
Can you hold on?
Hold on, baby
Won't you tell me now?
Hold on for one more day 'cause
It's gonna go your way
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day, yeah
Can't you change it this time?
[Outro]
Make up your mind
Hold on
Hold on
Baby, hold on
Hold on, hold on, baby6Embed
