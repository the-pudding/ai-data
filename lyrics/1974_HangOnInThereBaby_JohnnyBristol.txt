7 ContributorsHang On In There Baby Lyrics[Intro]
Hmmm
Hmmm, hmmm, yeah
Oh baby
Mhmmm
Hang in there, baby
(Oh, we make love tonight, mmmh)
Don't be afraid
(That'll make it alright, mmmh
I'm gonna just hide in fear
Gonna hold you tight)
But we've almost got it made

[Verse 1]
Now that we've caressed
A kiss so warm and tender
I can't wait 'till we reach
That sweet moment of surrender
Mmmh, we'll hear the thunder roar
Feel the lightning strike
At a point we both decided to meet the same time tonight

[Chorus 1]
Hang on in there baby, hang on in there darling
I'm gonna give you more than you ever dreamed possible
You might also like[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid baby, oooh no
Oh, sweet virgin of the world
Mmmh, we can't help but make it
'Cos there's true love between us girl
Mmmh, so let us touch that cloud
That every girl dreams of
Oh, we're almost there darling, we're truly making love

[Chorus 2]
Hang on in there baby, please don't let me down
Please don't destroy this new joy we found

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Interlude]
(Gonna make love tonight
We'll be alright)

Mmmh, what's that now baby?
What's that you say?
Something's eating at cha
And it's hard to get away
Oh, don't fight it baby
Open up the door
'Cos that's the key to the freedom
That we've both been working for
Let it go baby
Let it go honey, oh
Right there, right there
Baby, don't you move it anywhere
Go baby, let it go honey, oh right there
Baby, don't you move it, don't you dare
[Outro]
(Hang on in there, baby)
Oh, hang on babe
(Hang on in there, darling)
Oh, hang on darling
(I'm gonna give you more)
Ah, ah
(Than you ever dreamed possible
Hang on in there, baby)
Hang on sweet baby
(Please don't let me down)
Don't let me down
(Please don't destroy)
No!
(This new joy we've found
Go baby, let it go honey, oh right there)Embed
