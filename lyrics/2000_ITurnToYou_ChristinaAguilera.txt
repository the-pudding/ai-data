20 ContributorsI Turn to You Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find the light
To light my way
When I'm scared
Losing ground
When my world is goin' crazy
You can turn it all around, yes
And when I'm down, you're there
Pushin' me to the top
You're always there giving me all you've got

[Chorus]
For a shield from the storm
For a friend
For a love to keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
I turn to you, yes

[Verse 2]
When I lose the will to win
I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again
I can do anything
'Cause your love is so amazing
'Cause your love inspires me
And when I need a friend, you're always on my side
Giving me faith, taking me through the night, yeah

[Bridge]
For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain
For truth that will never change
For someone to lean on
For a heart I can rely on through anything
For the one (For the one) who I can run to, oh

For a shield from the storm (Yeah)
For a friend
For a love to keep me safe and warm (To keep me safe and warm, yeah, yeah)
