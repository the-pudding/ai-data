5 ContributorsIt’s Not Over (’Til It’s Over) LyricsListen
We don't call the shots here
We don't make the rules
We take what we get
Get what we can

That's learning the hard way
Here on the streets
You can't build a dream
Without a plan

(Passion speaks)
Let them hear you speak
(Play for keeps)
They play to win
We play for keeps

It's not over 'til it's over
It's not over 'til we get it right

The odds are against us
They say we don't stand a chance
Well, there's no givin' up
No givin' in

When push comes to shove
You got to fight
For what you love
You do what you must
Do what you can
You might also like(Passion speaks)
Let them hear you speak
(Play for keeps)
They play to win
We play for keeps

It's not over 'til it's over
(It's not over)
It's not over 'til we get it right

It's not over 'til it's over
(Don't go givin' in)
It's not over 'til we get it right
Get it

The odds are against us
To know we still stand a chance
There's no givin' up
No givin' in

It's not over
It's not over 'til it's over
It's not over 'til we get it right

It's not over 'til it's over
It's not over 'til we get it rightEmbed
