4 ContributorsPatches LyricsDown by the river that flows by the coal yards
Stand wooden houses with shutters torn down
There lives a girl everybody calls Patches
Patches, my darling, of Old Shanty town

We planned to marry when June brought the summer
I couldn't wait to make Patches my bride
Now I don't see how that ever can happen
My folks say "No" and my heart breaks inside

Patches, oh what can I do
I swear I'll always love you
But a girl from that place
Would just bring me disgrace
So my folks won't let me love you

Each night I cry as I think of that shanty
And pretty Patches there watching the door
She dosn't know that I can't come to see her
Patches must think that I love her no more

I hear a neighbour telling my father
He says a girl name of Patches was found
Floating face down in that dirty old river
That flows by the coal yards in Old Shanty Town
You might also likePatches, oh what can I do
I swear I'll always love you
It may not be right
But I'll join you tonight
Patches I'm coming to youEmbed
