There was a man
A lonely man
Who lost his love
Through his indifference

A heart that cared
That went unshared
Until it died
In his silence

Chorus
And solitaire it the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day
A lonely day
So much to say
That goes unspoken
You might also likeAnd through the night
His sleepless nights
His eyes are closed
His heart is broken

Chorus
And solitaire it the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope
Goes up in smoke
Just how it goes
Goes without saying

Solitaire......

And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
Oh, and keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always end the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire
