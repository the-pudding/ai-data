[Verse 1]
Have you heard about the new dance craze?
Listen to us, I'm sure you'll be amazed
Big fun to be had by everyone
It's up to you, it surely can be done
Young and old are doing it, I'm told
Just one try, and you too will be sold
It's called Le Freak, they're doing it night and day
Allow us, we'll show you the way

[Verse 2]
All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, chant the rhyme
Come on along and have a real good time
Like the days of "Stompin' at the Savoy"
Now we freak, oh what a joy
Just come on down to the 54
And find a spot out on the floor

[Chorus]
Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic

Now freak
I said freak

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, chant the rhyme
Come on along and have a real good time
Like the days of "Stompin' at the Savoy"
Now we freak, oh what a joy
Just come on down to the 54
And find a spot out on the floor
