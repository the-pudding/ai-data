[Verse 1: Robert Palmer]
Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well you're slim and you're weak
You've got the teeth of the hydra upon you
You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl

Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're built like a car, oh yeah
Well you're an untamed youth
That's the truth with your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl
