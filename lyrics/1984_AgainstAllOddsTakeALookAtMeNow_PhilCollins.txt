32 ContributorsAgainst All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now) Lyrics[Verse 1]
How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath
With you? Ooh, ooh

[Refrain]
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Verse 2]
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
‘Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears

[Refrain]
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Chorus]
So, take a look at me now
Well, there's just an empty space
And there's nothin' left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Ooh, take a look at me now
Well, there's just an empty space
And you comin' back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face
You might also like[Verse 3]
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why

[Refrain]
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Chorus]
So, take a look at me now
Well, there's just an empty space
And there's nothin' left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Now, take a look at me now
‘Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now
‘Cause I'll still be standin' here
And you comin' back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take

[Outro]
Take a look at me now10Embed
