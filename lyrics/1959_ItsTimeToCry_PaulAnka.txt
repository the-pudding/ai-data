4 ContributorsItâ€™s Time to Cry Lyrics[Verse 1]
When somebody leaves you
That's the time to cry
When you know you're lonely
You're not the one and only
Who will cry

[Verse 2]
When your heart is broken
That's the time to cry
When you know she's left you
You'll know that she has left you
So, you can cry

[Bridge]
Happiness is what I long for
Loneliness is why I cry
For you have made my heart a slave
And now it's up to you

[Verse 3]
When somebody leaves you
That's the time to cry
When you know she's left you
You'll know that she has left you
So, you can crySee Paul Anka LiveGet tickets as low as $39You might also likeEmbed
