Well, way down yonder in New Orleans
In the land of the dreamy scenes
Ah, there's a Garden of Eden
Ah, you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Creole babies with flashin' eyes
Softly whisper with tender sighs

[Bridge]
And then you stop
Oh, won't you give your lady fair a little smile?
And then you stop
You bet your life you'll linger there a little while

[Verse 3]
Yeah, there is Heaven right here on earth
Ah, with those beautiful queens
Yeah, way down yonder in New Orleans, woah

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Way down yonder in New Orleans, woah
In the land of the dreamy scenes
Ah, there's a Garden of Eden
Ah, you know what I mean
You might also like[Verse 2]
Well, Creole babies with flashin' eyes
Softly whisper with tender sighs

[Bridge]
And then you stop
Oh, won't you give your lady fair a little smile?
And then you stop
You bet your life you'll linger there a little while

[Verse 3]
Yeah, there is Heaven right here on earth
Ah, with those beautiful queens
Well, way down yonder in New Orleans, yeah, woahEmbed
