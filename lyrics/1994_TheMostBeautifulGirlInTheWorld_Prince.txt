Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world?
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl

[Verse 1]
When the day turns into
The last day of all time
I can say I hope you are in
These arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day
I will cry, I will cry
Tears of joy, 'cause after you
All one can do is die, oh

[Chorus]
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world?
Could you be?
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes, you are

[Verse 2]
How can I get through days
When I can't get through hours?
I can try, but when I do
I see you and I'm devoured, oh, yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow
A face to be soft as a flower? Oh
I could bow (Bow down)
And feel proud in the light of this power
Oh, oh, yes, oh

Could you be, could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world?
Could you be?
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes, you are

[Bridge]
And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be, uh, too far behind
'Cause baby, this kind of beauty
Has got no reason to ever be shy
'Cause honey, this kind of beauty
Is the kind that comes from inside

[Chorus]
Could you be (Could you be?)
The most beautiful girl in the world?
So beautiful, beautiful
It's plain to see, plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah! (Oh, yes, you are)

[Outro]
Girl (Could you be?)
You must be, oh, yeah!
(Could you be?)
You're the reason, oh, yeah
(Could, could, could)Embed
