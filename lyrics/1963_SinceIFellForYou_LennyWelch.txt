6 ContributorsSince I Fell For You LyricsWhen you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it so
And yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You
Made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love
Brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you

You love me
Then you snub me
But what can I do
I'm still in love with you
You might also likeWell I
Guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you

Since I fell for you...Embed
