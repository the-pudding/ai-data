16 ContributorsIgnition Lyrics[Intro]
You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is

[Verse 1]
Girl, please
Let me stick my key in your ignition, babe
So I can get this thing started and get rollin', babe
See I'll be doin' about 80 on your freeway
Girl, I won't stop until I drive you crazy
So buckle up cause this can get bumpy, babe
Now hit the lights and check out all my functions, babe
Girl, back that thing up so I can wax it, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

[Chorus]
Cause
We off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a'thuggin it out

Jump up, down once I hit them switches, babe
And I'm about to take it where you want to go, babe
Guarantee you I'm about to get some mileage, babe
And it won't be no runnin' out of gas, babe
It's like woo-ooh-ooh, pull over, babe
And let me put this lovin' off in your trunk, babe
So buckle up this could get bumpy, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

[Chorus]
Cause
We off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a'thuggin it out

[Verse 3]
Now hold on tight cause I'm about to go faster, babe
Girl, you dealing with a pro behind this wheel, babe
So tell me have you ever driven a stick, babe?
You'll be screamin' every time we shift them gears, babe
So brace yourself while I'm hittin' them corners, babe
When it's over put that Kells on your license plates
Now buckle up cause this can get bumpy, babe
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

[Chorus]
Cause
We off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a'thuggin it out

[Bridge]
When I hear you say:
(Green light) I'mma go
(Yellow light) Do it slow
(Red light) I'mma stop
When I hear you say:
(Switch lanes) Hit the signal
(Pit stop) Take a break
Hit the hazards when we park
Because we about to go real far

[Chorus]
Cause
We off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got this shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
We smokin' and we drinkin'
Just a'thuggin it out
