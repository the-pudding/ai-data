I saw him standing there
You were just seventeen
Way beyond compare

Well, he was just seventeen
And you know what I mean
And the way he looked
Was way beyond compare

I never danced with another
Whoo
When I saw him standing there

Well he looked at me
And I
I couldn't see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with him

He never danced with another
Whoo
When I saw him standing there

Well, my heart went boom
As I crossed the room
And I held his hand in mine
You might also likeOh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with him

He never danced with another
Whoo
When I saw him standing there

Well, my heart went boom
As I crossed the room
And I held his hand in mine

Oh
We danced through the night
And we held each other tight and
And before too long
I fell in love with him

He never danced with another
Whoo
When I saw him standing there

I saw him standing there
Well
Since I saw him standing there
Ow!
I saw you standing there
I saw you standing there
You were just seventeen
Way beyond compare
I saw you standing there

I saw you standing there
Don't ever dance
Don't ever dance with another nobody
