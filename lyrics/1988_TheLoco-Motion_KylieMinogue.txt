Everybody's doing a brand-new dance now
(Come on, baby, do the loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(Come on, baby, do the loco-motion)

[Pre-Chorus]
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your ABCs

[Chorus]
So come on, come on, do the loco-motion with me
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on, baby, jump up
Mm, jump back
Well, I think you got the knack, oh

[Verse 2]
Now that you can do it, let's make a chain now
(Come on, baby, do the loco-motion)
Chug-a chug-a motion like a railway train now
(Come on, baby, do the loco-motion)

[Pre-Chorus]
Do it nice and easy now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul

So come on, come on, do the loco-motion with me
The loco-motion
Come on, come on, the loco-motion
Come on, come on, the loco-motion
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 3]
Move around the floor in a loco-motion
(Come on, baby, do the loco-motion)
Yeah, do it holding hands if you got the notion
(Come on, baby, do the loco-motion)

[Pre-Chorus]
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue

[Chorus]
So come on, come on, do the loco-motion with me
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on, baby, jump up
Mm, jump back
Well, I think you got the knack, oh

[Bridge]
Do the loc—, do the loc—, do the loc—, the loco-motion
(Come on, baby, do the loco-motion)
Do the loc—, do the loc—, do the loc—, the loco-motion
(Come on, baby, do the loco-motion)
[Pre-Chorus]
Do it nice and easy now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul

[Chorus]
So come on, come on, do the loco-motion
Come on, come on, do the loco-motion
Come on, come on, do the loco-motion with me
The loco-motion
Come on, come on, the loco-motion
Come on, come on, the loco-motion
Come on, come on, the loco-motion
Come on, come on, the loco-motion
Come on, come on, come on2Embed
