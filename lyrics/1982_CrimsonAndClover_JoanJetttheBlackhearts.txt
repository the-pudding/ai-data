Ah
Now I don't hardly know her
But I think I can love her
Crimson and clover
Ah
When she comes walkin' over
Now I've been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover
Over and over

[Verse 2]
Yeah (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
My, my, such a sweet thing (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
I wanna do everything (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
What a beautiful feelin' (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
Crimson and clover (Ba-da, da-da, da-da)
Over and over

[Outro]
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and overYou might also likeEmbed
