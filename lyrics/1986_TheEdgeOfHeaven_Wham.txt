19 ContributorsThe Edge of Heaven Lyrics[Intro]
Ahhh
La da da da da

Yeah yeah yeah
La da da da da
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(x3)

[Verse 1]
I would lock you up but I could not bear to hear you
Screaming to be set free
I would chain you up if I'd thought you'd swear
The only one that mattered was me, me, me
I would strap you up but don't worry baby
You know I wouldn't hurt you unless you wanted me to
It's too late to stop, won't the heavens save me?
My daddy said, "The devil looks a lot like you"

[Chorus]
Take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can
Take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
When the passion dies
It's just a matter of time before my heart is looking for a home

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(x2)

[Verse 2]
I'm like a maniac at the end of the day
I'm like a doggie barking at your door
So come and take me back to the place you stay
And maybe we can do it once more
I'm dangerous but don't worry, baby
I get excited at the things that you do
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie
'Cause no one does it better than me and you

[Chorus]
Take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can
Take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
Please don't tell me lies
It's just a matter of time before my heart is looking for a home

Yeah yeah yeah
La da da da da
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(x2)
[Bridge]
I ain't got no more worries
I'm gonna spend some time with you
Loving you takes such courage
And don't you think that
I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it (x2)

Filthy

[Chorus]
Take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can
We can, woo
Take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
Don't you tell me lies
Because believe me, baby
One day you'll wake up on your own

Yeah yeah yeah (WOO)
La da da da da
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
La da da da da
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[Outro]
I ain't got no more worries
I ain't got no more time for you
Loving you takes such courage
Everyone's got their eye on you
I ain't got no more worries
I ain't got no more time for you
Loving you takes such courage
And don't you think that
I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it2Embed
