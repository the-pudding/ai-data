You're the girl of my dreams
I'd like to thank you
For waiting patiently

Daddy's home
Daddy's home to stay

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes

Daddy's home
Daddy's home to stay

It wasn't on a Sunday (Monday and Tuesday went by)
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon (all I could do was cry)
But I made a promise that you treasured
I made it back home to you

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes
You might also likeDaddy's home
Daddy's home to stay
Daddy's home to stay
I'm not a thousand miles away2Embed
