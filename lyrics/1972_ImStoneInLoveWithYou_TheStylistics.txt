7 ContributorsI’m Stone in Love with You Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I could, I'd like to be
A great big movie star
Overnight sensation
Drive a big expensive car
I would buy you everything
Your little heart desires
These things I do
‘Cause I'm stone in love with you
(Stone in love with you)

[Verse 2]
If I were a business man
I'd sit behind a desk
I'd be so successful
I would scare Wall Street to death
I would hold a meeting for
The press to let them know
I did it all
‘Cause I'm stone in love with you
(Stone in love with you)

[Verse 3]
I'm just a man, an average man
Doing everything the best I can
But if I could
I'd give the world to you
You might also likeI'd like to someday be the owner of
The first house on the moon.
There would be no neighbors
And no population boom
You might say that all I do
Is dream my life away
I guess it's true
‘Cause I'm stone in love with you

[Outro]
I guess it's true
‘Cause I'm stone in love with you
I guess it's true
‘Cause I'm stone in love with you1Embed
