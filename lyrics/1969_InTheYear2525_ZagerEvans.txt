27 ContributorsIn the Year 2525 Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find

[Verse 2]
In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies
Everything you think, do, and say
Is in the pill you took today

[Verse 3]
In the year 4545
Ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes
You won't find a thing to chew
Nobody's gonna look at you

[Verse 4]
In the year 5555
Your arms are hanging limp at your sides
Your legs got nothing to do
Some machine doin' that for you

[Verse 5]
In the year 6565
Ain't gonna need no husband, won't need no wife
You'll pick your son, pick your daughter, too
From the bottom of a long glass tube
Woah-oh

In the year 7510
If God's a-comin', He ought to make it by then
Maybe He'll look around himself and say
“Guess it's time for the Judgement Day”

[Verse 7]
In the year 8510
God is gonna shake His mighty head
He'll either say, "I'm pleased where man has been"
Or tear it down and start again
Woah-oh

[Verse 8]
In the year 9595
I'm kinda wonderin', if man is gonna be alive
He's taken everything this old earth can give
And he ain't put back nothing
Woah-oh

[Bridge]
Now, it's been ten thousand years
Man has cried a billion tears
For what he never knew
Now, man's reign is through
But through the eternal night
The twinkling of starlight
So very far away
Maybe it's only yesterday
[Verse 1]
In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find

[Outro]
In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies...6Embed
