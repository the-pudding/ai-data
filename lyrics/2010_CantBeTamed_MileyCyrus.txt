Rock Mafia

[Verse 1]
For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep
24 hours a day, 'cause I'm hot like that
Every guy everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that

[Pre-Chorus]
I go through guys like money flying out the hands (Ooh-oh-ooh)
They try to change me, but they realize they can't (Ooh-oh-ooh)
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh)
If you're gonna be my man, understand

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be blamed (Oh)
I can't, can't, I can't
Can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be changed (Oh)
I can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be, be (Yeah, babe)
I can't be tamed

If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya
Or tell you to go to hell (I'm not a brat like that)
I'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this
We can make some magic, I'm wrong like that

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go (Ooh-oh-ooh)
I wanna be a part of something I don't know (Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh)
Baby, by now, you should know

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be tamed (I can't be tamed; Oh)
I can't be blamed (Oh)
I can't, can't, I can't
Can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be changed (Oh)
I can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be, be
I can't be tamed

[Bridge]
Well, I'm not a trick you play
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake
It's set in my DNA
(DNA, yeah) Don't change me
(DNA, yeah) Don't change me (Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
(DNA, yeah) Don't change me (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh)
(DNA, yeah) Don't change me (Yeah)
I can't be tamed
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go (Ooh-oh-ooh)
I wanna be a part of something I don't know (Ooh-oh-ooh-oh)
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh)
So baby, by now you should know

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed (Tamed; Oh)
I can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be blamed (Oh)
I can't, can't, I can't
Can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be changed (Oh)
I can't be tamed (Oh)
I can't be, can't
I can't be tamed15Embed
