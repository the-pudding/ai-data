2 ContributorsStop and Think It Over LyricsWe've got to stop and think it over
Before we say we're in love
Are we right for each other
Can what we feel be lasting love

We've got to stop and think it over
Before we break each other's heart
Will this love last forever
Or someday calls us to part

For many loves
Have gone wrong
Oh so many hearts
Are in pain
Just like us
They were too young
And they played
A losing game

We've got to stop and think it over
Before we break each other's heart
Will this love last forever
Or someday calls us to part
Or someday calls us to partYou might also likeEmbed
