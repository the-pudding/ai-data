8 ContributorsYou Should Hear How She Talks About You Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's so very nice, you should break the ice
Let her know that she's on your mind
Whatcha tryin' to hide when you know inside
She's the best thing you'll ever find?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, can't you see it?
Don't you think she's feeling the same?
Ah, I guarantee it
She's the one who's calling your name

[Chorus]
You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she said
She says she would be lost without you
She's half out of her head (out of her head)

You should hear how she talks about you
She just can't get enough
She says she would be lost without you
She is really in love (she's in love with you, boy!)

[Verse 2]
I ain't tellin' tales
Anybody else could repeat the things that I've heard (heard)
She's been talkin' sweet and it's on the street
How that girl's been spreadin' the word
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, you should hurry
You should let her know how you feel
Ah, now don't you worry
If you're scared her love is for real

[Chorus]
You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she said
She says she would be lost without you
She's half out of her head (out of her head)

You should hear how she talks about you
She is really in love (she is really in love)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, you should hurry
You should let her know how you feel
Ah, now don't you worry
If you're scared her love is for real

[Chorus]
You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she said
She says she would be lost without you
She's half out of her head (Out of her head)
You should hear how she talks about you
She just can't get enough
She says she would be lost without you
She is really in love (She is really in love)

[Bridge]
Talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Can't you see? (can't you see?)
It's me! (ooh!)
(What she said, what she said, ah)

[Chorus]
You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she said (what she said)
She says she would be lost without you
She's half out of her head (out of her head)

You should hear how she talks about you
She just can't get enough (get enough)
She says she would be lost without you
She is really in love (really in love)

You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she said (what she said)
She says she would be lost without you
She's half out of her head (out of her head)
You should hear how she talks about you1Embed
