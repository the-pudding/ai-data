15 ContributorsA Teenager in Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
'Cause I'm so afraid
That we will have to part

[Refrain]
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

[Verse 2]
One day, I feel so happy
The next day, I feel so sad
I guess I'll learn to take
The good with the bad

[Refrain]
'Cause each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

[Chorus]
I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through
You might also like[Verse 3]
Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

[Refrain]
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

[Chorus]
I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through

[Verse 4]
Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
And if you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

[Refrain]
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?
[Outro]
(In love) Why must I be a teenager in love?
(In love) Why must I be a teenager in love?
(In love) Why must I be a teenager in love?5Embed
