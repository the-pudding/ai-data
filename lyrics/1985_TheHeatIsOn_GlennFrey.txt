The heat is on
On the street
Inside your head
On every beat
And the beat's so loud
Deep inside
The pressure's high
Just to stay alive
'Coz the heat is on

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-wo-ho
Oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho
Oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it

[Chorus]
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
Oh! It's on the street
The heat is on
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-wo-ho
Oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho
Oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it

[Chorus]
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
Oh! It's on the street
The heat is on

[Verse 2]
The shadows high
On the darker side
Behind those doors
It's a wilder ride
You can make a break
You can win or lose
That's a chance you take?
And the heat's on you
And the heat is on
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-wo-ho
Oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho
Oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it

[Chorus]
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
Oh! It's on the street
The heat is on

[Outro]
It's on the street
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
Yeah! It's on the street
The heat is onEmbed
