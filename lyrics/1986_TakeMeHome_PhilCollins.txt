Take that look of worry
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing
So I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning
Right outside my door
I can't see, but I feel it
And it helps to keep me warm

[Pre-Chorus: Phil Collins]
So, I, I don't mind
No, I, I don't mind

[Verse 2: Phil Collins]
Seems so long I've been waiting
Still don't know what for
There's no point in escaping
I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can turn off my feelings
Like they're turning off the light

[Pre-Chorus: Phil Collins]
But, I, I don't mind
No, I, I don't mind
Oh, I, I don't mind
No, I, I don't mind
You might also like[Chorus: Phil Collins]
So take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh Lord

[Post-Chorus: Phil Collins]
'Cause I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you

[Verse 3: Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel & Sting]
Take that look of worry (Oh-oh)
Mine's an ordinary life (Oh-oh)
Working when it's daylight (Oh-oh)
And sleeping when it's night (Oh-oh)
I've got no far horizons (Oh-oh)
I don't wish upon a star (Oh-oh)
They don't think that I listen (Oh-oh)
Oh, but I know who they are (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Phil Collins]
And, I, I don't mind
No, I, I don't mind
Oh, I, I don't mind
No, I, I don't mind

[Chorus: Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel & Sting, Phil Collins]
So take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh Lord
[Post-Chorus: Phil Collins]
Well, I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you, but I don't remember

[Chorus: Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel & Sting, Phil Collins]
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, 'cause I don't rememberâ€¦9Embed
