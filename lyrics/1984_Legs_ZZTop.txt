18 ContributorsLegs Lyrics[Verse 1]
She got legs
She knows how to use them
She never begs
She knows how to choose them

[Verse 2]
She holding leg
Wonder how to feel them
Would you get behind them
If you could only find them?

[Chorus]
She's my baby
She's my baby
Yeah, it's alright
Oh, yeah

[Verse 3]
She's got hair
Down to her fanny
She's kinda jet set
Try undo her panties

[Verse 4]
Every time she's dancing
She knows what to do
Everybody wants to see
If she can use it
See ZZ Top LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like[Chorus]
She is so fine
She's all mine
Girl, you got it right
Ooh

[Instrumental Break 1:59-2:36]

[Verse 1]
She got legs
She knows how to use them
She never begs
She knows how to choose them

[Verse 5]
She got a dime
All of the time
Stays out at night
Moving through time

[Chorus]
Oh, I want her
Shit I got to have her
The girl is alright
She's alright, oh
