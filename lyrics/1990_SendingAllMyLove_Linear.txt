Nothing really matters to me
When you're gone, when you're gone
Nothing really matters to me
When you're gone, when you're gone

[Verse 1]
Girl, I close my eyes
And then I start to cry for you
You're the reason why
I have to say goodbye to you

This pain I have inside
Just makes me want to die for you
All these lonely nights
They just don't seem so right for you

I'm sending you all my...

[Chorus]
Sending all my love
I'm sending all my love to you
I'm sending all my love
I'm sending all my love to you

[Verse 2]
Every move you make
Day by day, I pray for you
When I close my eyes
Teardrops start to fall for you
You might also likeI'm sending all my love
Sending all my love to you
This pain I have inside
Just makes me want to die for you

[Chorus]
I'm sending all my love
Sending all my love to you
I'm sending all my love
Sending all my love to you

[Bridge]
I'm sending all my love
Sending all my love to you
(Sending you all my)

Sending all my love
Sending all my love to you

[Verse 3]
Girl, I close my eyes
And then I start to cry for you
You're the reason why
I have to say goodbye to you

This pain I have inside
Just makes me want to cry for you
All these lonely nights
They just don't seem so right for you
[Chorus]
I'm sending all my love
Sending all my love to you
I'm sending all my love
Sending all my love to you

I'm sending all my love
Sending all my love to you
I'm sending all my love
Sending all my love to you
