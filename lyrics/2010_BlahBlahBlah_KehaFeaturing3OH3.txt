Ah

[Verse 1: Kesha]
Blah, blah, blah, blah, bl-bl-blah, blah, blah
Coming out'cha mouth with'cha blah, blah, blah
Zip your lip like a padlock (Yeah)
And meet me in the back with the Jack at the jukebox (back, back)
I don't really care where you live at (Aw)
Just turn around, boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at

[Pre-Chorus: Kesha]
Mu-mu-mu-music's up (Up)
Listen hot stuff (Stuff), I'm in love (Love) with this song
So just hush (Hush)
Baby, shut up (Uh)
Heard enough

[Chorus: Kesha]
Stop ta-ta-talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car-ar-ar
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Boy, c'mon and get my rocks off
Come put a little love in my glove box
Wanna dance, with no pants on? (Holla!)
Meet me in the back with the Jack at the jukebox
(Aw) So cut to the chase, kid
'Cause I know you don't care what my middle name is
I wanna be naked and you're wasted

[Pre-Chorus: Kesha]
Mu-mu-mu-music's up (Up)
Listen hot stuff (Stuff), I'm in love (Love) with this song
So just hush (Hush)
Baby, shut up (Uh)
Heard enough

[Chorus: Kesha]
Stop ta-ta-talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car-ar-ar
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[Bridge: 3OH!3]
You be delaying, you always saying some ​shit (So?)
You say I'm playin', I'm never layin' the dick (Layin')
Saying, "Blah, blah, blah"
'Cause I don't care who you are in this bar
It only matters who I is
Is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is
[Chorus: Kesha]
Stop ta-ta-talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car-ar-ar
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah (Oh)
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car-ar-ar
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[Outro: Kesha]
Oh
Blah, blah, blah
Stop talking!
Stop ta-ta-talking that—17Embed
