When I was just Otis Williams
A young punk getting into mischief
And the only temptation I knew, was the streets
[OTIS, singing]
You played hooky from school
So you can't go out to play, yeah
[TEMPS, singing]
Bum bum bum bum bum
[OTIS, singing]
Ooooh
[TEMPS, singing]
Bum bum bum bum
[OTIS, singing]
Mama said for the rest of the week
In your room, you gotta stay, yeah
[TEMPS, singing]
Child
[OTIS, spoken]
We were five young bloods growing up in Detriot
All of us came up from the south with our folks
Who were looking for jobs in the auto industry
Country boys, had to change their game quick up North

[OTIS, singing]
Now you feel like the whole world's pickin' on you
[TEMPS, singing]
Now you feel like the whole world's pickin' on you
[OTIS, singing]
But deep down inside you know it ain't true
[TEMPS, singing]
It ain't true, it ain't true
You might also like[OTIS, singing]
Hey you've been punished 'cause your mother
Wants to raise you the right way, yeah
[TEMPS, singing]
Bum bum bum bum bum
[OTIS, singing]
Ooooh
[TEMPS, singing]
Bum bum bum bum
[OTIS, singing]
You don't care!
[TEMPS, singing]
Oh child
[OTIS, singing]
'Cause you already made up your mind
You want to run away

[MAN, spoken]
Where you from country bumpkin?
[OTIS, spoken]
Who you callin' country bumpkin?
[MAN 2, spoken]
You from Texas, ain't you son?
[MAN, spoken]
That's country bumpkin!
[MAN 2, spoken]
Don't come here actin' better than us city boys. You either sang or you join a gang
[MAN 2, spoken]
If you can't do neither than you better learn to run
[MAN, spoken]
You a cheat country bumpkin!
[OTIS, spoken]
I ain't no cheat!
[MAN 2, spoken]
You gonna give me another turn or what?
[OTIS, singing]
You're on your way
[TEMPS, singing]
Oh runaway child, running wild
[OTIS, singing]
Oh runaway child, running wild

[OTIS, spoken]
Now I was raised by my two Gramama's in Texarkana
They are where I got my sense of order and obedience
But when I got to Detroit to live with my Mama, Hazel
That obedience stuff went right out the window

[DAVID, singing]
Roaming through the city going nowhere fast
You're on your own at last
[PAUL, singing]
Hey, it's getting late, where will you sleep
[TEMPS, singing]
Running, oh running
[MELVIN, singing]
Gettin' kinda hungry
[TEMPS, singing]
You forgot to bring something to eat
[EDDIE, singing]
Oh, lost with no money, you start to cry
[DAVID, singing]
But remember you left home
Wanting to be grown
So dry your weepin' eyes
[JUDGE, spoken]
Otis Williams, you've been sided for being involved in gang activity and robbery
You are hereby sentenced to six months in juvenile detention center
[OTIS, spoken]
I was only sixteen, it figured this couldn't be the path for the rest of my life
There had to be another way

[OTIS, singing]
Siren screamin' down, neon light is flickin'
You want your
[TEMPS, singing]
Mama
[DAVID, singing]
But she's much too far away
[PAUL, singing]
She can't hear a word you say
[OTIS, singing]
You heard some frightening news on the radio
About little boys running away from home
And their parents don't see them no more
[EDDIE, singing]
You want to hitch a ride and go home
[DAVID, singing]
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go

[DAVID, singing]
Streets are dark and deserted
Not a sound nor sign of life
How you long to hear your mother's voice, oh
[TEMPS, singing]
Run

[JUDGE, spoken]
Otis Williams, you've served six months in juvenile detention
Am I going to see you in my courtroom again?
[OTIS, spoken]
Judge, I swear to you and God, if you give me another chance
I ain't never going do nothing to make me lose my freedom again

[TEMPS, singing]
Runaway child, running wild
[OTIS, singing]
Runaway child, running wild
[TEMPS, singing]
You better go back home, where you belong

[OTIS, spoken]
I was free, never looking back
That was all she wrote for the gang storyEmbed
