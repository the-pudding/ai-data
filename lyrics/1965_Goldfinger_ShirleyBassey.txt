19 ContributorsGoldfinger Lyrics[Verse 1]
Goldfinger
He's the man
The man with the Midas touch
A spider's touch
Such a cold finger
Beckons you to enter his web of sin
But don't go in

[Chorus]
Golden words he will pour in your ear
But his lies can't disguise what you fear
For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her
It's the kiss of death from Mr. Goldfinger

[Verse 2]
Pretty girl, beware of his heart of gold
This heart is cold

[Chorus]
Golden words he will pour in your ear
But his lies can't disguise what you fear
For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her
It's the kiss of death from Mr. Goldfinger

[Verse 2]
Pretty girl, beware of his heart of gold
This heart is cold
