2 ContributorsNext Door To An Angel Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm living right next door to an angel
And I just found out today
I'm living right next door to an angel
And she only lives a house away

[Chorus]
She used to be such a skinny little girl
But all of a sudden she's out of this world
I'm living right next door to an angel
And I'm gonna make that angel mine

[Verse 2]
Since I saw her this morning
I'm on cloud number nine
Found a Garden of Eden
At the house next door to mine

[Chorus]
I took a look
And, oh, what a shock
To find a little bit of heaven right
On the block
I'm living right next door to an angel
And I'm gonna make that angel mine

I can't believe that this is the girl next door
Her funny little face isn't funny no more
Sixteen and, oh, what a dream
Ain't it strange how she changed into such a lovely angel

[Verse 3]
Saw her walking down main street
And I couldn't believe my eyes
It used to be such a plain street
But now it's paradise

[Chorus]
I feel so happy
I'm feeling so good
I'm the luckiest devil in the neighborhood
I'm living right next door to an angel
And I'm gonna make that angel mineEmbed
