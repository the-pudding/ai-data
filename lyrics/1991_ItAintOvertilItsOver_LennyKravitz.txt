25 ContributorsIt Ain’t Over ’Til It’s Over Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here we are still together
We are one
So much time wasted
Playing games with love

[Chorus]
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over

[Verse 2]
How many times
Did we give up?
But we always worked things out
And all my doubts and fears
Kept me wondering, yeah
If I'd always, always be in love

[Chorus]
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
And kept our love alive
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over

So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over 'til  it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
'Cause, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
(Over, over, over)
So many tears we've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
'Cause, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
(Over, over, over, over)

So many tears we've cried
So much pain inside
Baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
