6 ContributorsWhen I Look Into Your Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see forever
When I look in your eyes
You're all I ever wanted
I always want you to be mine
Let's make a promise
Till the end of time
We'll always be together
And our love will never die

[Pre-Chorus]
So, here we are face to face and heart to heart
I want you to know we will never be apart
Now, I believe that wishes can come true
'Cause I see my whole world
I see only you

[Chorus]
When I look
Into your eyes
I can see how much I love you and it makes me realize
When I look
Into your eyes
I see all my dreams come true
When I look
Into your eyes

I've looked for you
All of my life
Now that I've found you
We will never say goodbye
I can't stop this feeling and there's nothing I can do
'Cause I see everything
And I look at you

[Chorus]
When I look
Into your eyes
I can see how much I love you and it makes me realize
When I look
Into your eyes
I see all my dreams come true
When I look
Into your eyes

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
When I look
Into your eyes
I can see how much I love you and it makes me realize
When I look
Into your eyes
We will always be together and our love will never die
[Outro]
When I look
Into your eyes
I see that only dreams come true
When I look
Into your eyes
When I look
Into your eyesEmbed
