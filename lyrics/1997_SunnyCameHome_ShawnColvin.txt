25 ContributorsSunny Came Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

[Chorus]
She says, "Days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire"

[Verse 2]
Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
"And it's time for a few small repairs," she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

[Chorus]
She says, "Days go by, I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire"

[Bridge]
Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it

Oh, days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire
Oh, light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own and she's alright
Sunny came home

[Outro]
Sunny came home
Came home
