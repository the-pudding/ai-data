9 ContributorsYou Are the Woman Lyrics[Chorus]
You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

[Verse 1]
It's not so much the things you say to me
It's not the things you do
It's how I feel each time you're close to me
That keeps me close to you
Whoa oh

[Chorus]
You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

[Verse 2]
It's not so much your pretty face I see
It's not the clothes you wear
It's more that special way you look at me
That always keeps me there
Whoa oh whoa

[Chorus]
You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart
You might also like[Bridge]
It's hard to tell you all the love I'm feeling
That's just not my style
You've got a way to send my senses reeling
Every time you smile
Whoa

[Chorus]
You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

[Outro]
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart
Of my heart
Ooh, of my heart1Embed
