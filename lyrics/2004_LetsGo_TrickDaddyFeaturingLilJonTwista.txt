Hahahahahahahaaaa

There's a lot of fuck niggas in the club tonight (fuck 'em! fuck 'em! fuck 'em!)
Ay (ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
But its gonna be aight (yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah!)

Cause me and my clique we don't give a fuck nigga
Ay (ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
Trick Daddy, Jim Johnson, Big D, Lil Jon

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it, let me know (let me know)

Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go! (Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Trick Daddy]
If you want some - come get some
Cause where I'm from we tote big guns
And everybody know somebody
That know somebody that know somethin' 'bout it
And I want answers now
Who, what, where, when and why?
See, a lot of dudes like to act a fool
And on get all loud but that ain't my style (what?!)
Now who he gon' get? And what he gon' do?
Run up on me if he want to
Out there impressin' his homies
But he stood up in front of his momma
I mop up the flo' with him
And I kick in the door and let the fo-fo hit him
I got fools that'll go get him
This for him, his crew and the dudes that run with him

Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it, let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go! (Let's go!)

[Verse 2: Twista]
Gotta spit it for the murderers and the killers and the thugsters
That be fuckin' up the ballers and the dealers and the hustlers
Got me comin' at you bogus in the V.I
While they bumpin' Lil Jon, I'mma rush ya
It's the psycho nigga Twista from Chicago
Rollin' with the Miami nigga, that'll crush ya
We already been lookin' for drama
If a nigga try to get into it, but what if, we still gotta get him
Feelin' fury from my tough shit that can't never be cute and no penicillin
I'm telling you Trick I'm finna steal 'em
Got me swingin' Crissy and Hennessey bottles in the club
And my homies goin' for ya scrilla
Don't get it twisted with that "Overnight Celebrity"
You better be scared of me, and my city I'm a killer

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it, let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go! (Let's go!)
[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
I ain't that rapper type, alright?
And I that actor type, alright?
Bein' soft ain't in my script
I'm a playa, you, you just a square
See, once that Hennessy into me
The whole industry is my enemy (My enemy)
If you ain't no kin to me or friend to me
Bitch! Don't pretend to be
Yeah, I'm strictly for the thugs
I'm part of the streets and straight out the hood
M.O is ghetto (Ghetto)
And I don't even need the gat for you bougie cats
I'm straight out the county of Dade
3-0-5, nigga M-I-A
Never gone south of the border
America's most wanted, you gon' get slaughtered

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it, let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go! (Let's go!)
Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it, let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go! (Let's go!)
If you want it you can get it let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go! (Let's go!)
