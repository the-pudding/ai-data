13 ContributorsWhat About Love? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well on your way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

[Chorus]
What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only wanna share it with you
You might need it someday

[Verse 2]
I can't tell you what you're feeling inside
And I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing, you gotta look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

[Chorus]
What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only wanna share it with you

[Chorus]
What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
But what about love?
I only wanna share it with you, oh

[Outro]
No
Oh, oh, what about love?
Love
Ooh
What about love?
Love, love, love
What about, what about love?
