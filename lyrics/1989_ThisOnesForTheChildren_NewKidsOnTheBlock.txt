4 ContributorsThis One’s for the Children Lyrics[Intro]
This is a very serious message
So all of you please listen

[Verse 1]
There are some people living in this world
They have no food to eat
They have no place to go
But we all are God’s children
We’ve got to learn to love one another
Just remember, they could be us
Remember, we all are brothers

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m not trying to darken up your day
But help others in need
And show them there’s a better way

[Chorus]
This one’s for the children
The children of the world
This one’s for the children
May God keep them in His throne

[Verse 2]
Many people are happy
And many people are sad
Some people have many things
That others can only wish they had
So for the sake of the children
Show them love’s the only way to go
‘Cause they are tomorrow
And people, they’ve got to know

Many people are sad)
This one’s, for the children
