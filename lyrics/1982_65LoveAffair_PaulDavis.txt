8 Contributorsâ€™65 Love Affair LyricsI was a car hop
You were into be-bop
You sang "do wop diddy wop diddy wop doo"
All of them changes you put me through

If I could go back again
Well I know I'd never let you go
Back with some of my friends
To that wonderful

'65 Love Affair, We wasn't gettin' nowhere
But we didn't care, it was a crazy
'65 Love Affair
Rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear
I can hear it baby

Yeah!

Well I acted like a dumb-dumb
You were bad with your pom-poms
You said "ooh wah go team ooh wah go"
Ooh-ee baby I want you to know

If I could go back in time
Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind
To that wonderful
You might also like'65 Love Affair
When rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear
I can hear it baby

Well, I tried to make you give in
One night at the drive-in
You said "oh no baby, oh no woo"
All of them changes you put me through

If I could go back in time
Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind
To that wonderful

'65 Love Affair
We weren't going nowhere
But we didn't care, it was crazy
'65 Love Affair
Rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear
I can hear it baby

We sang "doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo"...
"Go, go, go team go!"...
If I could go back again
Well I know our love would never end
Back with all my friends
To that wonderful

'65 Love Affair
Rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear
I can hear it baby
'65 Love Affair
We wasn't going nowhere
But we didn't care, it was crazyEmbed
