10 ContributorsLonely Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

[Verse 2]
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant

[Chorus]
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

[Interlude]
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

[Verse 3]
Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
You might also like[Outro]

Lonely days, lonely nights
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights) Yeah, yeah
Lonely days, lonely nights
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Lonely days, lonely nights
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights) Yeah, yeah
Lonely days, lonely nights...3Embed
