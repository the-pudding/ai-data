Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day, but tonight I drink

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I gotta get over you and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options and take your pick

[Chorus]
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

[Verse 2]
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forgеt
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get

If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey, some Grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop lovin' you?
Hey, what you want me to do?

[Chorus]
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

[Post-Chorus]
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you

[Bridge]
I ain't no Superman, I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on, then I need me somethin' in my hand
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
And if you ain't comin' back
[Chorus]
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

[Post-Chorus]
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you1Embed
