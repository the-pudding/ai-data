Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you (Oh yeah)
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Oh, baby, baby (Oh)
Oh, baby, baby (Yeah, yeah)
