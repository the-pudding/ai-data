[Chorus]
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind-a girl who gives up just like that, oh no

[Verse 1]
It's not the things you do that tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kind-a girl who gives up just like that, oh no

[Chorus]
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one, number one

[Pre-Chorus]
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear till it's my turn
I'm not the kind-a girl who gives up just like that, oh no

[Chorus]
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one, number one, number one
