8 ContributorsOne in a Million You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love had played its games on me so long
I started to believe I'd never find anyone
Doubt had tried to convince me to give in
Said, "You can't win"
But one day the sun came a-shinin' through
The rain had stopped and the skies were blue
And oh, what a revelation to see
Someone was sayin', "I love you," to me

[Chorus]
A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called "You"
A one in a million you

[Verse 2]
I was a lonely man with empty arms to fill
Then I found a piece of happiness to call my own
And life is worth livin' again
For to love you, to me, is to live

[Chorus]
A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called "You"
A one in a million you
A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called "You"
One in a million you

A one in a million youEmbed
