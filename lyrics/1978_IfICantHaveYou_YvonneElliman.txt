25 ContributorsIf I Canâ€™t Have You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't know why I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end
And it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time
If I turn away

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do

[Chorus]
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Can't let go, and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily to you, my love
To dreams that never will come true

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do
You might also like[Chorus]
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh, if I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh (Don't want nobody)
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh (I don't want nobody)
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh (Nobody)
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, oh, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby3Embed
