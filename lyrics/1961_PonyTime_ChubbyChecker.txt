It's Pony time, get up

Hey now, everybody (Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo)
In the union hall (Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo)
It's Pony time (Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo)
When you hear this call (Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo)

Do the Pony with your partner (Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo)
Or in a big boss line (Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo)
Well, any way you do it (Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo)
You're gonna look real fine (Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo)

[Refrain]
So, get with it, hoo
(Don't quit it), Get up
(Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo)
