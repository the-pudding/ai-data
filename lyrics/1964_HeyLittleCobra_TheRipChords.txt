Hey, Little Cobra, don't you know you're gonna shut 'em down

[Verse 1]
I took my Cobra down to the track
Hitched to the back of my Cadillac
Everyone was there just a-waiting for me
There were plenty of Stingrays and XKEs

[Chorus]
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra, getting ready to strike
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra with all of your might
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra, getting ready to strike
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra with all of your might
Hey, little Cobra, don't you know you're gonna shut 'em down

[Verse 2]
When the flag went down you could hear rubber burn
The Stingray had me going into the turn
I hung a big shift and I got into high
And when I flew by the Stingray I waved bye-bye

[Chorus]
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra, getting ready to strike
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra with all of your might
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra, getting ready to strike
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra with all of your might
Hey, little Cobra, don't you know you're gonna shut 'em down
You might also like[Verse 3]
Around the far turn in a straight-away
I was blowing off everything that got in my way
The Stingrays and Jags were so far behind
I took my Cobra out of gear and let it coast to the line

[Chorus]
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra, getting ready to strike
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra with all of your might
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra, getting ready to strike
(Shut 'em down) Spring little Cobra with all of your might
Hey, little Cobra, don't you know you're gonna shut 'em down

[Outro]
Shut 'em down
Shut 'em down
Shut 'em down
Shut 'em down
Shut 'em down
Shut 'em downEmbed
