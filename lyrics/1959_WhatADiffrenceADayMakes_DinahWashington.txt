4 ContributorsWhat A Diffâ€™rence A Day Makes LyricsWhat a difference a day made
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine

Lord, what a difference a day made
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss
That thrilling kiss

It's heaven when you
Find romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is youYou might also likeEmbed
