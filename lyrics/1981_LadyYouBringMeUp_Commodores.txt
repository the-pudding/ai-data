7 ContributorsLady (You Bring Me Up) Lyrics[Intro]
Lady
You bring me up when I'm down
Maybe
You're gonna change my life around

[Verse 1: Lionel Richie]
You came to me when I was lonely
And no one cared
You made me see that I was only
Just running scared
I saw your face and something told me
You were the one
You smiled at me and now I see
My life's begun

[Chorus]
Lady
You bring me up when I'm down
Maybe
You're gonna change my life around
Lady
You brought me in from out the rain (Yeah)
Maybe
My life will never be the same

Once I was filled with desperation
A solitary man
You gave me hope and inspiration
Like only true love can
Now I believe in what you're saying
I'm ten feet tall
This love don't need no explaining
We've got it all

[Chorus]
Lady
You bring me up when I'm down (Up when I'm down)
Maybe (Maybe)
You're gonna change my life around

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Whoa lady
You bring me up when I'm down (Up when I'm down)
Maybe (Yeah)
You're gonna change my life around (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh lady
Ooh lady
You bring me up when I'm down
Maybe
You're gonna change my life around
Ooh lady

Ooh lady
You bring me up when I'm downEmbed
