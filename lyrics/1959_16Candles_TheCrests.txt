8 Contributors16 Candles LyricsHappy birthday, happy birthday, baby
Oh, I love you so

[Verse 1]
16 candles
Make a lovely light
But not as bright
As your eyes tonight

[Verse 2]
Blow out the candles
Make your wish come true
For I'll be wishing
That you love me, too (That you love me, too)

[Bridge]
You're only sixteen (sixteen)
But you're my teenage queen (oh, my queen)
You're the prettiest, loveliest girl
I've ever seen (I've ever seen)

[Verse 3]
16 candles
In my heart will glow
For ever and ever
For I love you so (For I love you so)

You're only sixteen (sixteen)
But you're my teenage queen (oh, my queen)
You're the prettiest, the loveliest girl
I've ever seen (I've ever seen)

[Verse 4]
16 candles
In my heart will glow
For ever and ever
For I love you so
For I love you soEmbed
