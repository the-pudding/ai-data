You send cold chills up and down my spine
We kiss for thrills, then you draw the line
Oh baby (Oh baby)
'Cause your mama told you that love ain't right
But don't you know good lovin' is the spice of life, yeah

[Chorus 1]
Mama's pearl, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin'
(What you been missin') Ooh ooh, now baby

Goody girl, let down those curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Don't keep me wishing
(Don't keep me wishing)

[Verse 2]
(Bum, bum, bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum)

You want my lovin' yes you do, do, do
You know my lovin' is true, true, true, now baby
But your conscience tells you that love is wrong
But just a little lovin' never hurt no one, oh
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Mama's pearl, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin'
(What you been missin') Ooh ooh, now baby

Goody girl, let down those curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Don't keep me wishing
(Don't keep me wishing)

[Bridge]
Let all it hang (Girl, don't be afraid)
(Oh, we've got the first step made)
(Ooh, the rest is up to you)
(Here is what to do, let yourself go)
Let yourself just oh now, now no
Let your lovin' go now, now
Just give it to me
('Cause I got what you need)
I got what you need
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love

[Chorus 2]
Find out what you're missin'
Goody girl, lay down your curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Why don't you give my love a whirl
(Girl, don't be afraid)
(Ooh, we've got the first step made)
(Ooh, just give it, just give it to me)
('Cause I got what you need)
Got what you need
(Let's fall in love, let's fall in love)
(Let's yourself go)

Let yourself just oh now, now no
Let your lovin' go now, now
Just give it to me
('Cause I got what you need)
Oh, mama's pearl
(Girl, don't be afraid)
(Let's fall in love, let's fall in love)
(Daddy's girl we've got it made)
I know what you been missin', sugar!
Goody, goody, goody girl, ooh1Embed
