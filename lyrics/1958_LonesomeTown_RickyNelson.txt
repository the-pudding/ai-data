There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And they call it Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay

[Verse 2]
You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears

[Bridge]
Goin' down to Lonesome town
Where the broken hearts stay
Goin' down to Lonesome town
To cry my troubles away

[Verse 3]
In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget (To forget)

[Outro]
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget
