9 ContributorsA World Without Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Please lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside
Where I hide
With my loneliness

[Chorus]
I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

[Verse 2]
Birds sing out of tune
And rain clouds hide the moon
I'm okay
Here I'll stay
With my loneliness

[Chorus]
I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

[Bridge]
So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love smile
She may come, I know not when
When she does, I'll know, so baby, until then
You might also like[Verse 1]
Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside
Where I hide
With my loneliness

[Chorus]
I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love smile
She may come, I know not when
When she does, I'll know, so baby, until then

[Verse 1]
Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside
Where I hide
With my loneliness
[Chorus]
I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without love
I don't care what they say
I won't stay in a world without loveEmbed
