Hello, it's me again
Don't you know
It's hard to keep a good woman down?
But then again, maybe that could be fun
Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Samantha Fox

[Verse 1]
Ain't it funny how when I say let's go out
You're always saying someone else will get me?
What's a girl to do? I like to have fun too
But you're so jealous, you never let me leave

[Verse 2]
So how come you can leave
But when it comes to me
Always something I must prove? (I must prove to you)
You know I love you, always thinking of you
But tonight, I've got to make that move

[Chorus]
I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
Move my body all night long (move my body all night long)
I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
Move my body all night long (move my body all night long)

Hey, we got here a part to go to tonight
Well, alright!
I've been saving up all day just for this
I am ready and I am out the door

[Verse 3]
Working 9 to 5 each and every day
(What your momma used to say?)
(All work, no play)
I know what to do, I think I'll call my crew
Of course I love you
But naughty girls need fun too

[Verse 4]
Could it be that I make you feel guilty, why?
Is there something I can't see? (no)
I just don't buy it (so)
Don't even try it
I've got to go in the place to be

[Chorus]
I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
Move my body all night long (move my body all night long)
Working hard every day (working hard every day)
I ain't staying home, no way (I ain't staying home, no way)
I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
Move my body all night long (move my body all night long)
I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
Work my body all night long (work my body all night long)

[Bridge]
I need it (I need it)
I want it (I want it)
I need it (I need it), I want it (I want it)
I've got to (got to)
Flaunt it (flaunt it)

I'm not a prisoner, can't you see?
Unlock the door so I can breathe
Whenever it comes to you, my dear
I say stay with me, but you still go
So now I learn, It's my turn

[Chorus]
I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
I wanna have some fun
I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
I wanna have some fun

[Spoken Interlude]
Listen, I want you to stay right here with me
You can have fun with me
With you?
Yeah, with me!
Come on, I can have loads of fun without you
Without me?
Yeah!
[Bridge]
Just let me slip away (just let me slip away)
So I can play in the place to be
Get busy one time
Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Samantha Fox

[Chorus]
I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
Move my body all night long (move my body all night long)
I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
Move my body all night long (move my body all night long)

I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)

I wanna have some fun (I wanna have some fun)
Move my body all night long (move my body all night long)
Working hard every day (working hard every day)
So I ain't staying home, no way (I ain't staying home, no way)Embed
