Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)

[Verse 1]
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count them, one, two, three

[Pre-Chorus]
First you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine)

I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction, it doesn't leave a track
I've got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

[Pre-Chorus]
When you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
Now this boy is addicted and your kiss is the drug

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I want
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I need

[Verse 3]
I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine is what I want
Bad, bad medicine (I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta)

[Breakdown]
I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hold on
I'm not done
One more time
With feeling
Come on
Help me out now

[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up just like bad medicine
You got the potion that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Your kiss is what I need
Your love, bad medicine8Embed
