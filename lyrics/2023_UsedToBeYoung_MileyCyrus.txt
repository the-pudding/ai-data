The truth is bulletproof, there's no foolin' you
I don't dress the same
Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
'Cause that's for chasin' cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And goin' way too far

[Chorus]
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'causе I used to be young

[Verse 2]
Take onе, pour it out, it's not worth cryin' 'bout
The things you can't erase
Like tattoos and regrets, words I never meant
And ones that got away
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
And took another road
Turns out crowded rooms empty out as soon
There's somewhere else to go, oh-oh
You might also like[Chorus]
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'cause I used to be young

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh
Yeah
Woah-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh

[Chorus]
I know I used to be crazy
Messed up, but, God, was it fun
I know I used to be wild
That's 'cause I used to be young
Those wasted nights are not wasted
I remember every one
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'cause I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'cause I used to be young5Embed
