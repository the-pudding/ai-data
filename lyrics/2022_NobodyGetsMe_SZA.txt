Took a long vacation
No make-up, just JAY-Z
You were balls-deep, now we beefin'
Had me butt-naked at the MGM
So wasted, screamin', "Fuck that"
Blurry now, but I meant it then
Hurry now, baby, stick it in
'Fore the memories get to kickin' in

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late, I don't wanna lose

[Chorus]
What's left of you
How am I supposed to tell you
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do
You do
Nobody gets me, you do

Took me out to the ballet
You proposеd, I went on the road
You was feelin' empty so you lеft me
Now I'm stuck dealin' with a deadbeat
If I'm real, I deserve less
If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
I pretend when I'm with a man it's you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that it's too late, I don't wanna lose

[Chorus]
What's left of you
How am I supposed to tell you
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)

[Outro]
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
Nobody gets me, you do11Embed
