Are reaching for you
But like a dream
You vanish from view
My lonely lips
Are hungry for your kisses
My empty arms
Can't believe that we're through
No stars are shining up above tonight
'Cause you don't love me as you did before
I'll always love you
So I'll say no stars are shining
Until you fill
My empty arms once more
I'll always love you
So I'll say no stars are shining
Until you fill
My empty arms once againYou might also likeEmbed
