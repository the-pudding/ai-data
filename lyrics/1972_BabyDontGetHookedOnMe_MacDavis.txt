7 ContributorsBaby, Donâ€™t Get Hooked on Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, you're getting that look in your eyes
And it's starting to worry me
I ain't ready for no family ties
Nobody's gonna hurry me

Just keep it friendly, girl
Cause I don't wanna leave
Don't start clinging to me, girl
Cause I can't breathe

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me, oooh
Cause I'll just use you
Then I'll set you free
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me

[Verse 2]
Girl, you're a hot-blooded woman-child
And it's warm where you're touching me
But I can tell by your trembling smile
You're seein' way too much in me

Girl, don't let your life get tangled up with mine
Cause I'll just leave you
I can't take no clinging vine
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Cause I'll just use you
Then I'll set you free
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Cause I'll just use you
Then I'll set you free
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me. oh
Baby, baby2Embed
