Darling, I know
I'm just another head on your pillow
If only just tonight, girl
Let me hear you lie just a little
Tell me I'm the only man
That you ever really loved

[Bridge]
Honey, take me back in my memory
Place when it was all very right
So very nice (So very nice)
So very nice

[Verse 2]
Here, darling
Stands another bandit wanting you
In and out your life
They come and they go, baby
Your days and nights like a wheel that turns
Grindin' down a secret part of you
Deep inside your heart
That nobody knows, baby

[Chorus]
When you say comfort me
To anyone who approaches
Chalking up the hurt
We live and you learn
Well, we've both lived long enough to know
That we'd trade it all right now
For just one minute of real love, darling
Real love, hey baby (Real love)
I need to believe in (Real love)
Real love, baby (Real love)
Real love, darling (Real love)

[Chorus with band]
When you say comfort me
To anyone who approaches
Chalking up the hurt
You live and we learn (Oooh)
Well, we've both lived long enough to know
That we'd trade it all right now
For just one minute of real love, darling

[Outro]
Real love, real love
Real love, real love
(Real love) Whoa, whoa (Real love)
I need to believe in (Real love)
Real love, darling (Real love)
Just one minute of (Real love)
Real love, baby (Real love)
Just one minute of (Real love)
Hey, yeah (Real love)
Real love (Real love)Embed
