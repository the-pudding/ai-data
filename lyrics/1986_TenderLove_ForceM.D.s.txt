14 ContributorsTender Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I lay all alone
Tossin', turning
Longing for some of your tender love
I'm waiting for the right moment to come
So I can thank you for
All the tender love you've given to me

[Chorus]
Tender love, love so tender
Pulling me close to you
Baby, I surrender

[Verse 2]
Candles they light the dark
Now I see how lovely the feelings are
All the tender love you've given to me

[Verse 3]
I want you more and more, can't resist you
Ooh then I feel your touch, tender love
Loving me straight from the heart, hold me nearer
Please let me be a part of the tender love you're giving to me

[Chorus]
Tender love, love so tender
Holding me close to you
Baby, I surrender
You might also likeOoh yeah, surrender baby

La la la

[Outro]
Tender love
Please let me be a part
