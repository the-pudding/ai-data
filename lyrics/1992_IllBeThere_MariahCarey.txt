This next song is made popular
By incredible Jackson 5
And it's always been one of my favorite songs
And I hope it's yours
It's called, "I'll be there"

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name
And I'll be there

[Chorus: Trey Lorenz]
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad I found you
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holding on

Let me fill your heart
With joy and laughter
Togetherness, well it's all I'm after
Just call my name
I'll be there

[Verse 4: Mariah Carey]
I'll be there to protect you, yeah baby
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name
And I'll be there

[Chorus: Trey Lorenz]
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
You know I'm so glad I found you
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holding on

[Verse 5: Mariah Carey]
If you should ever find someone new
I know she'd better be good to you
'Cause if she doesn't
I'll be there
Don't you know baby, yeah, yeah
[Hook: Mariah Carey]
I'll be there
I'll be there
Just call my name
And I'll be there
I'll be there, baby
You know I'll be there
Just call my name
And I'll be there

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Just look over your shoulder
Just call my name
And I'll be there
