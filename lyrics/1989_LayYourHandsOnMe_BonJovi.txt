If you're ready, I'm willing and able
Help me lay my cards out on the table
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking
Right now the rules we made are meant for breaking
What you get ain't always what you see
But satisfaction's guaranteed
They say what you give is always what you need
So if you want me to lay my hands on you

[Chorus]
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me

[Verse 2]
I'm a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a preacher
I've been to school and baby, I've been the teacher
If you show me how to get up off the ground
I can show you how to fly and never ever come back down
Everything you want is what I need
Satisfaction's guaranteed
But the ride don't never ever come for free
If you want me to lay my hands on you
You might also like[Chorus]
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me

[Outro]
Don't you know I only aim to please
If you want me to lay my hands on you
Lay your hands on me1Embed
