5 ContributorsWhen Can I See You Lyrics[Verse 1]
When can my heart beat again?
When does the pain ever end?
When do the tears stop from running over?
When does "you'll get over it" begin?

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear what you're sayin'
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you

[Chorus]
When can I see you again?
And when can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you...

[Verse 2]
When does my someday begin?
When I'll find someone again?
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then, baby, baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
So when can I see you...
You might also like[Chorus]
When can I see you again?
And when can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again, baby?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you again?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah baby
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense, baby
So when can I see you again?

[Chorus]
When can I see you again?
When can my heart beat again? Baby, yeah
When can I see you again, baby?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you again?

[Outro]
Again
I wanna see you again
