[Verse 1: Gabe Saporta]
Girl, I've been all over the world
Looking for you
I'm known for taking what I think I deserve
And you're overdue
And if you listen, you can hear me through the radio
In that bright white noise
What I been missin' in my life, what I been dreamin' of
You'll be that girl, you'll be that girl
You'll be

[Pre-Chorus: Sabi]
Everything you want, so let me get up there
I'm the baddest, baby, in the atmosphere
Tell me what you want so we can do just what you like

[Chorus: Gabe Saporta & Sabi]
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la
You, you make me feel, oh
You might also like[Verse 2: Gabe Saporta]
Get a little closer to me, girl
And you'll understand
'Cause if you want a guy that knows what you need
Well, then I'm your man
And if I listen, I can hear you through my radio
In that bright white noise
What I been missin' in my life, what I been dreamin' of
You'll be that girl, you'll be that girl
You'll be

[Pre-Chorus: Sabi]
Everything you want, so let me get up there
I'm the baddest, baby, in the atmosphere
Tell me what you want so we can do just what you like (Oh-oh-oh)
Everything you know, I flip it upside down
Take you around the world, you know I like it loud
Tell me what you want, 'cause we can do just what you like

[Chorus: Gabe Saporta & Sabi]
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la
You, you make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
[Bridge: Gabe Saporta & Sabi]
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Let the lights drop, let the lights drop
Make my world stop, make my world stop
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

[Chorus: Gabe Saporta & Sabi]
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la-la)
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la (Oh, you make me feel good)
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la (Oh, you make me feel good)
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la (Oh, you make me feel good)
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la (Oh, you make me feel good)
You make me feel that
