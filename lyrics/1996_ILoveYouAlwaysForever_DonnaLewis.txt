22 ContributorsI Love You Always Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
Feels like
I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists
Of pale amber rose
Feels like
I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching
Discovering you

[Verse 2]
Those days
Of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air
Summer night, summer night air
Secret moments
Shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say it, say it again

[Chorus]
I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together
Everywhere
I will be with you
Everything (say it, say it again)
I will do for you
I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together
Everywhere
I will be with you
Everything
I will do for you

You've got
The most unbelievable blue eyes
I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
Say it, say it again

[Chorus]
I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together
Everywhere
I will be with you
Everything (say it, say it again)
I will do for you
I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together
Everywhere
I will be with you
Everything
I will do for you
[Bridge]
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere
And every
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere
And every
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere
And every
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere
And everything

[Outro]
Yeah! Mmmm, yeah!
I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together
Everywhere
I will be with you
Everything
I will do for you
I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together
Everywhere
I will be with you
Everything
I will do for you
I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together3Embed
