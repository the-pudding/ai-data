I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

[Verse 1]
Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
All alone in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you
All of the time, what am I gonna do?

[Chorus]
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

[Verse 2]
Sometime, don't you feel
Like you never really had a love that's real?
Well, here I am and who's to say?
A better love you won't find today
Just one chance and I will show you love
Like no other, two steps above
And on your ladder, I'll be a peg
I want your lovin', please don't make me beg
You might also like[Chorus]
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

[Bridge]
I want your love, I need your love
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds need sky above
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need

[Chorus]
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

I want your love, I want your loveEmbed
