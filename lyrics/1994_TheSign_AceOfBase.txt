Whoa, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
(Ah) I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
(Ah) Why do I bother
When you're not the one for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is enough, enough?

[Chorus]
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong?

[Verse 2]
(Ah) Under the pale moon
For so many years, I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is enough, enough?

[Chorus]
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong?

[Break]
Oh, oh-oh
(Oh no)
(Oh no)
(Oh no)

[Chorus]
I saw the sign
And it opened up my mind, and I am happy now
Living without you, I've left you, oh-oh-oh
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
[Outro]
(I saw the sign, I saw the si-i-ign) I saw the sign
(I saw the sign, I saw the si-i-i-ign)
(I saw the sign, I saw the sign) I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign14Embed
