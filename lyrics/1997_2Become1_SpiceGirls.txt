34 Contributors2 Become 1 Lyrics[Verse 1: Sporty, Scary]
Candle light and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it, say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real, don't be a stranger
We can achieve it, we can achieve it

[Pre-Chorus: Baby]
Come a little bit closer, baby
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night, when two become one

[Chorus: Ginger & Baby, Sporty & Posh, Scary]
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

[Verse 2: Sporty, Ginger]
Silly games that you were playing
Empty words we both were saying
Let's work it out, boy, let's work it out, boy
Any deal that we endeavour
Boys and girls feel good together
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it

Are you as good as I remember, baby?
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night, when two become one

[Chorus: Ginger & Baby, Sporty & Posh, Scary]
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

[Bridge: Baby]
Be a little bit wiser, baby
Put it on, put it on
'Cause tonight is the night, when two become one

[Chorus: Ginger & Baby, Sporty & Posh, Scary]
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
[Outro: Scary]
It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be5Embed
