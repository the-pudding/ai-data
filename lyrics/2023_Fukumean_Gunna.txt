(Ooh, Dunk Rock)

[Chorus]
Fuck you mean?
Young Gunna Wunna back, callin' me splurge
Watch me jump right off the curb
Bentley Spur fly like a bird
Spin on the first and the third
Solid, I'm keepin' my word
Can't be my equal, I don't know what you heard
Crank up the foreign, I swerve
Keep me a stick if they purge
[Bridge]
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha

[Verse]
Fuck you mean?
Young Gunna Wunna, they workin' my nerves
I'm about to pour up some syrup
Fucking this bitch like a perv'
Smack from the back, grab her perm
Ice, the berg, uh, shittin' on all you lil' turds
Can't take that dick, wait your turn
In my own lane, we can't merge
Suck with no hands, you can learn
Let's see how much you can earn
Watch me go big likе the Worm
And I ain't smokin' no sherm
I'm in this bitch with P Liity
QP, QP-ski
All of my bitches is prеtty, they showin' they titties, it's up to the ceilin'
I let her run through a million, I rock with her really, let's fuck on a billion
I'ma get down to the gritty, then fuck up the city, the home of the villains
Ecstasy, wonderful feelin'
Smoke out the pound when I'm chillin'
Trappin', I made me a killin'
Look, I got everybody wishin'
I hope you play your position
I don't want nobody listenin'
I see the ho with precision
Get rich my only decision
See Gunna LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also like[Chorus]
Fuck you mean?
Young Gunna Wunna back, callin' me splurge
Watch me jump right off the curb
Bentley Spur fly like a bird
Spin on the first and the third
Solid, I'm keepin' my word
Can't be my equal, I don't know what you heard
Crank up the foreign, I swerve
Keep me a stick if they purge

[Outro]
Fuck you mean?
Fuck you mean?
