It all came so easy
All the lovin' you gave me
The feelings we shared
And I still can remember
How your touch was so tender
It told me you cared

[Pre-Chorus]
We had a once in a lifetime
But I just couldn't see
Until it was gone
A second once in a lifetime
May be too much to ask
But I swear from now on

[Chorus]
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll hold you forever
This time, we'll never end

[Verse 2]
Now I'm seeing clearly
How I still need you near me
I still love you so
There's something between us
That won't ever leave us
There's no letting go (No letting go)

We had a once in a lifetime
But I just didn't know it
'Till my life fell apart
A second once in a lifetime
Isn't too much to ask
'Cause I swear from the heart

[Chorus]
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll hold you forever
This time, we'll never end, never end

[Bridge]
The best of romances
Deserve second chances
I'll get to you somehow
'Cause I promise now

[Chorus]
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll hold you forever
This time, we'll never end
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll hold you forever
This time, we'll never end
[Outro]
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time, I'll hold you forever
This time, we'll never end1Embed
