12 ContributorsThe One and Only Lyrics[Intro]
I am the one and only, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Call me, call me by my name or call me by number
You put me through it
I'll still be doing it the way I do it
And yet, you try to make me forget
Who I really am, don't tell me I know best
I'm not the same as all the rest

[Chorus]
I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

[Verse 2]
I've been a player in the crowd scene
A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
High hopes and aspirations, and years above my station
Maybe but all this time I've tried to walk with dignity and pride

[Chorus]
I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me
You might also like[Verse 3]
I can't wear this uniform without some compromises
Because you'll find out that we come
In different shapes and sizes
No one can be myself like I can
For this job I'm the best man
And while this may be true
You are the one and only you

[Chorus]
I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from meEmbed
