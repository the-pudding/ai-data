Valleri
I love her, Valleri

[Verse 1]
There's a girl I know who makes me feel so good
And I wouldn't live without her, even if I could

[Chorus]
They call her Valleri
I love her, Valleri

[Spoken]
Oh, yeah
Come on

[Verse 2]
She's the same little girl who used to hang around my door
But she sure looks different than the way she looked before

[Chorus]
I call her Valleri
I love her, Valleri

[Chorus]
Valleri
I love her, Valleri

I love her, Valleri
I need her, ValleriEmbed
