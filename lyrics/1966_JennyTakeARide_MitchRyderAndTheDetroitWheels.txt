I said see, what you have done now
Oh see, C. C. Rider
I said see, what you have done now
Ahh, you made me love you
Now, now, now, now your man has gone

Oh, I'm going with my baby
And I won't be back 'til fall, yeah
Oh, I'm going with my baby
And I won't be back 'til fall, yeah
And if I find me a new girl
I won't be back at all

Ah, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, won't you come along with me
(Jenny, Jenny, woo, Jenny, Jenny)
Jenny Jenny, Jenny, won't you come along with me
