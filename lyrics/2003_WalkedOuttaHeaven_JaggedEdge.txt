17 ContributorsWalked Outta Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1: Brian]
I'm rolling down a lonely highway
Asking God to please forgive me
For messing up the blessing he gave to me
I see everything clearer now
The nights is black as, black as its ever been (Ooh)
Without my girl, I'ma lose it
I pray that he would just shed his grace on me
I need just to be back with my baby, yeah

[Chorus: Jagged Edge]
It feels like I just walked right out of Heaven
And it feels like I have damn near thrown my life away (Oh)
And I'm scared just like a child that's lost at seven (I'm so scared)
Don't know what to do to get back right with you (Yeah, oh, yeah)
It feels like I just walked right out of Heaven
And it feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, yeah (Oh)
Like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do
Feels like I just walked right out of Heaven

[Verse 2: Brandon]
See my mama told me that's if it's meant to be
She'll come back and she'll forgive me
And the best thing I can do is to just let her, let her go
I know, I don't wanna do it
But if I continue to push, she'll just pull away (Don't pull away)
And I know that in my heart, it's a reality
I didn't treat her like she wanted to be treated
And I hope that she's not gone for good, no, no, no

It feels like I just walked right out of Heaven (Oh)
And it feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, yeah (Damn near thrown my life away, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Jagged Edge & Wingo]

Suppose to move on with my life (On with my life)
And, girl, I tried and I tried (I tried and I tried)
