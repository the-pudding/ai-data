15 ContributorsIâ€™ll Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
Stop me and steal my breath
And emeralds from mountains that thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth

[Pre-Chorus]
And tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

[Chorus]
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

[Verse 2]
And rain falls angry on the tin roof
As we lie awake in my bed
And you're my survival, you're my living proof
My love is alive and not dead

[Pre-Chorus]
And tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

[Bridge]
And I've dropped out, I've burned up, I've fought my way back from the dead
I tuned in, I turned on, remembered the thing that you said

[Chorus]
And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life
And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

[Outro]
The greatest fan of your life
