Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness, all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player, you haffi know how fi play
If she say, "A night," convince her, say, "A day"
Never admit to a word weh she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, "Baby, no way!"

But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Mek she know say that she really no have right fi vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else weh favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the likkle evidence, you betta know fi mask
Quick 'pon yuh answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you betta run fast
[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & Shaggy]
But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Uh, it wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
[Bridge: Rikrok]
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin', it makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost
That's why I sing
[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me79Embed
