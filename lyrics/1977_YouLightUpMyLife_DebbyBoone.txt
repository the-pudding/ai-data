11 ContributorsYou Light Up My Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
So many nights
I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone
To sing me his song

So many dreams
I've kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along

[Chorus]
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song

[Verse 2]
Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, "Hey, I love you,"
Never again
To be all alone
You might also like[Chorus] x2

[Outro]
It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my lifeEmbed
