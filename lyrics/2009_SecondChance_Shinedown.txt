44 ContributorsSecond Chance Lyrics[Verse 1]
My eyes are open wide
By the way, I made it through the day
I watched the world outside
By the way, I'm leaving out today

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I just saw Halley's comet, she waved
Said, "Why you always runnin' in place?"
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

[Chorus]
Tell my mother, tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize, this is my life
I hope they understand

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes "Goodbye" is a second chance

[Verse 2]
Please don't cry one tear for me
I'm not afraid of what I have to say
This is my one and only voice
So listen close, it's only for today

Well, I just saw Halley's comet, she waved
Said, "Why you always runnin' in place?"
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

[Chorus]
Tell my mother, tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize, this is my life
I hope they understand

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes "Goodbye" is a second chance

[Bridge]
Here's my chance
This is my chance

[Chorus]
Tell my mother, tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize, this is my life
I hope they understand
[Post-Chorus]
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes "Goodbye" is a second chance

[Outro]
Sometimes "Goodbye" is a second chance
Sometimes "Goodbye" is a second chance29Embed
