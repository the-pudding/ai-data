2 ContributorsPretty Blue Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Thought I was in love before
And then you moved in next door
Pretty blue eyes
Pretty blue eyes

[Verse 2]
All the guys from the neighborhood
Keep sayin' you sure look good
With your blue eyes
Pretty blue eyes

[Bridge]
Saw you from my window
My heart skipped a beat
Gonna sit by your doorstep
So that I can meet

[Verse 3]
Pretty blue eyes, please come out today
So, I can tell you what I have to say
That I love you, love you
Pretty blue eyes

[Bridge]
Saw you from my window
My heart skipped a beat
Gonna sit by your doorstep
So that I can meet
You might also like[Verse 3]
Pretty blue eyes, please come out today
So, I can tell you what I have to say
That I love you, love you
Pretty blue eyes

[Outro]
Pretty blue eyes
Pretty blue eyes
