Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day
Dance with me

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Guy time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, let's give it a whirl
See, I've been watchin' you
And I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass-shakin' thing you do

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you, girl
Make a move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl
See, it appears to me
You like the way I move
I'll tell you what I'm gon' do
Pull you close and share my groove

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]

[Post-Chorus: Vanessa Marquez & Justin Timberlake]
Talk to me, boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me, boy
But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause you're takin' too long
Talk to me, boy
Better have you naked by the end of this song

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake, Vanessa Marquez, Both]
So what did you come for?
I came to dance with you
And you know that you don't wanna hit the floor
Came to romance with you
You're searchin' for love forever more
And I'll take a chance
If love is here on the floor, girl
[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, dance with me
Yeah
Come on, baby

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away (Don't walk away)
Come on and dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay (Let me rock your body)
Come on and dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play (You don't have to admit you wanna play)
Just dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day (Do-do-do-do)
Come on and dance with me

[Post-Chorus: Vanessa Marquez & Justin Timberlake]
Talk to me, boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me, boy
But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause you're takin' too long (Come on, baby)
Talk to me, boy
Better have you naked by the end of this song

[Breakdown: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away (I was just thinkin' of you)
Don't be so quick to walk away (We could do somethin')
Don't be so quick to walk away (I like the way you look right now)
Don't be so quick to walk away (Come over here, baby)

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Are you feelin' me?
Let's do somethin'
Let's make a bet
'Cause I
I better have you naked by the end of this song22Embed
