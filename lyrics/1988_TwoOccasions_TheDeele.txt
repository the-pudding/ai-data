8 ContributorsTwo Occasions Lyrics[Verse 1: Darnell Bristol]
A summer love is beautiful
But it's not enough
To satisfy emotions
That are shared between us
A winter love is cozy
But I need so much more
It just intensifies my wants
To have a love that endures

[Pre-Chorus: Babyface]
'Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season is
I still love you
With all my heart
And I wanna be with you
Wherever you are

[Chorus: The Deele]
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right

[Verse 2: Carlos "Satin" Greene]
An autumn love is special
At this time of the year
But when the leaves are gone
Does that love disappear?
I never underestimate the new love of spring
But I'm glad to say in my heart
I know my love's lasting
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Babyface]
'Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season is
I still love you
With all my heart
And I wanna be with you
Wherever you are

[Chorus: The Deele]
I only think of you on two occasions (What's that?)
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right

[Pre-Chorus: Babyface]
'Cause every time I close my eyes
I think of you
And no matter what the season is
I still love you
With all my heart
And I wanna be with you
Wherever, â€”ever you are
[Chorus: The Deele]
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right3Embed
