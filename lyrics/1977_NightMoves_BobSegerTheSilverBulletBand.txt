46 ContributorsNight Moves Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own, sitting way up high
Way up firm and high
[Verse 2]
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues

[Chorus]
Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime (Mmm)
In the sweet summertime

[Verse 3]
We weren't in love, oh no far from it
We weren't searchinâ€™ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley, or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share
You might also like[Chorus]
Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
Mmm, and it was summertime
Mmm, sweet summertime, summertime
[Bridge]
And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
Yeah, and we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

[Verse 4]
I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in
[Outro]
Mmm, night moves (Mmm)
Night moves (Night moves)
Night moves (Yeah)
Night moves (I remember)
Night moves (Ah, sure remember the night moves)
Night moves (Ain't it funny how you remember?)
Night moves (Funny how you remember)
Night moves (I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember)
Night moves (Oh, oh, oh)
Night moves (We were working, working and practicing)
Night moves (Working and practicing)
Night moves (Oh for the night moves, night moves)
Night moves (Oh)
Night moves (I remember, yeah yeah yeah)
Night moves (I remember, ooh)
Night moves (I remember, Lord I remember)
Night moves (Lord I remember, huh huh)
Ooh
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Uh huh, uh huh
I remember, I remember10Embed
