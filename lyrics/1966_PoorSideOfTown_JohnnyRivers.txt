Doop-doo-doo-wah
Shoo-bee-doo-bee
Doop-doo-doo-wah
Shoo-bee-doo-bee

[Verse 1]
How can you tell me how much you miss me
When the last time I saw you, you wouldn't even kiss me?
That rich guy you've been seein' must have put you down
So, welcome back, baby, to the poor side of town

[Verse 2]
To him you were nothin' but a little plaything (Was a plaything, doo wah)
Not much more than an overnight fling (Overnight fling, doo wah)
To me you were the greatest thing this boy had ever found
And girl, it's hard to find nice things on the poor side of town

[Bridge]
I can't blame you for tryin' (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
I'm tryin' to make it, too (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
I've got one little hang up, baby
I just can't make it without you (Without you, without you)

[Verse 3]
So, tell me are you gonna stay now? (Gonna stay now, doo wah)
Will you stand by me, girl, all the way now? (All the way now, doo wah)
With you by my side they can't keep us down
Together we can make it, baby, from the poor side of town
You might also like[Verse 4]
(Come tell me how much you love me)
(Come be near to me and say you need me, now)
Oh, with you by my side this world can't keep us down
Together we can make it, baby, from the poor side of town

[Outro]
Doop-doo-doo-wah
Shoo-bee-doo-bee
Doop-doo-doo-wah
Shoo-bee-doo-bee
(Doop-doo-doo-wah
Shoo-bee-doo-bee)Embed
