1 Contributor(If You Let Me Make Love To You Then) Why Canâ€™t I Touch You? Lyrics[Chorus]
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?

[Verse 1]
I'm not saying I want to change you
And I don't want to rearrange you

[Chorus]
Oh, if you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?

[Verse 2]
From the very first moment I saw you
It's been a different world
From the very first moment I saw you
It's been such a different world

[Verse 3]
I seem to be a little bit stronger
Each moment seems just a little-little bit longer
The missing links and little kinks
Have never been found and uncurled
But you're still the same
You're like a frozen flame
Well, it sure seems a shame
That you let me make love to you
But you won't let me touch you
You might also like[Verse 4]
When I leave you, I'm going someplace
That I've never been before
When I leave you, I'm going someplace
That I've never been before
Oh, reach out and touch me
Why don't you reach out and touch me?

[Chorus]
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
If you let me make love to you
Then why-why can't I touch you?Embed
