Keep me hanging on
Set me free, why don't you, babe?
Get out my life, why don't you, babe?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging on

[Chorus]
Set me free, why don't you, babe?
Get out my life, why don't you, babe? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
'Cause you don't really need me
But you keep me hanging on

[Verse 1]
Why do you keep on coming around
Playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a brand new start?
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me, yeah

[Chorus]
Set me free, why don't you, babe?
Get out my life, why don't you, babe? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging on
Now you don't really need me
You just keep me hanging on
You might also like[Verse 2]
You say although we broke up
You still just wanna be friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again?
(And there ain't nothing I can do about it)

[Bridge]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me (Hanging on) hanging on

[Verse 3]
You say you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
And now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else
[Chorus]
Set me free, why don't you, babe?
Get out my life, why don't you, babe? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging on
Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
Now you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me, hey, abusing me
Get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night (Ooh-woo, ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging on (Ooh-woo, ooh)2Embed
