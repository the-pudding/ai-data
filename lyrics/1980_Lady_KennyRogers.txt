Lady
I'm your knight in shining armor
And I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love
There's so many ways I want to say
I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

[Chorus]
You have gone
And made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh
We belong together
Won't you believe in my song

[Verse 2]
Lady
For so many years I thought
I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever
Let me wake to see you each
And every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear
You might also like[Chorus]
In my eyes
I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes
Oh yes, I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long

[Verse 3]
Lady
Your love's the only love I need
And beside me
Is where I want you to be
'Cause my love
There's something I want you to know
You're the love of my life
You're my lady3Embed
