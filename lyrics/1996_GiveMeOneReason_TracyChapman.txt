Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't wanna leave you lonely
You gotta make me change my mind

[Verse 1]
Baby, I got your number
Oh, and I know that you got mine
You know that I called you, I called too many times
You can call me baby, you can call me anytime
But you got to call me

[Chorus]
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't wanna leave you lonely
You gotta make me change my mind

[Verse 2]
I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I just want someone to hold me
Oh, and rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you, yes
And give you what you need
I said this youthful heart can love you
Oh, and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy

[Chorus]
Give me one reason to stay here
Yes, now turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
Oh, I'll turn right back around
Said I don't wanna leave you lonely
You gotta make me change my mind

[Outro]
Baby, just give me one reason
Give me just one reason why
Baby, just give me one reason
Oh, give me just one reason why I should stay
Said I told you that I loved you
And there ain't no more to say14Embed
