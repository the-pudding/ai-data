There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me
Like no one else
And behind your dark glasses, you're
You're something else

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad
You might also like[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely

[Bridge: Gwen Stefani]
And so many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better, better, better

[Verse 4: Lady Saw]
For real
'Cause underneat' it all, you are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire, you were always burnin'
Anytime you're around, my body keeps callin'
For your touch, your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side of you, weh this a woman yah adore
Aside from your temper, everything else secure
You're good for me, baby, for that, I'm sure
'Cause over and over again, me want more
[Verse 3: Gwen Stefani]
You've used up all your coupons
And all you got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]
