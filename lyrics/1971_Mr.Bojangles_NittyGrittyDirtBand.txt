In worn out shoes
With silver hair, and ragged shirt, and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumped so high, jumped so high
Then heâ€™d lightly touch down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans I was
Down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As the smoke ran out
He talked of life, talked of life, laughed
Clicked his heels and stepped

He said his name "Bojangles" and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants and feathered stance
Oh he jumped so high and then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke through tears of 15 years how his dog and him
Traveled about
The dog up and died, he up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit"
He shook his head, and as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him please

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance...1Embed
