6 ContributorsDiamonds Lyrics[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
You told me you love me
You told me you care
But when I'm around you
It's like I'm not there
I need a reminder
Something I can see
Something on my finger shines so brightly

[Chorus: Janet Jackson & Lisa Keith]
Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
When you go
They stay with me until the end
Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's best
Best friend
When you go
They stay with me until the end

[Refrain: Janet Jackson]
Don't want your money
Don't want your key
Diamonds
Love don't come for free
Don't want your money
Don't want your key
Diamonds
Love don't come for free

They say you need some roses
But roses do die
You gave me some candy
It melted
Nice try
I'm not that demanding
I have simple taste
I just want a token that can't go to waste
Diamonds

Love don't come for free

When you go
They stay with me until the end
