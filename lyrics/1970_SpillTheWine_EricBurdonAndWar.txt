[Verse 1]
I was once out strolling
One very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun
And felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed

[Verse 2]
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie, yes I did
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me
An overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmm
But there I was, mmm

[Verse 3]
I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain king
I stood high up on a mountaintop
Naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones
Short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones
Big ones, crazy ones

Out of the middle
Came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said

[Chorus]
"Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl"

[Verse 5]
I thought to myself
What could that mean?
Am I going crazy
Or is this just a dream?
Now wait a minute, I know I'm lying
In a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then, I heard her say
One more time

[Chorus]
"Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, and take that pearl
Spill the wine, and take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl"
[Verse 6]
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine
From the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it
She said

[Chorus]
"Take the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Come on, come on
Spill the wine, take that pearl"

[Outro]
Take that pearl, yeah
It's all yours
All you gotta do is
Spill that wine, spill that wine
Let me feel, let me feel funky
Yeah, ow! Come on
Spill the wine, spill the wine
Spill the wine, spill the wine
Spill the wine, spill the wine
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Ooh! It's all yours...4Embed
