Ooh, oh, yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Hey, baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things, you can never choose
Even if you try, yeah
You're bangin' your head again
'Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't go on just runnin' away
If we stay any longer, we will surely never get away
Oh, oh, anything you want, we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around, never let them shoot us down

[Chorus]
Never
Never
Never
Never run away

Now walk those legs right over here
Give me what I'm dying for
One chance, one love
Hold me down, never let me go

Stand up and turn around, never let them shoot us down
