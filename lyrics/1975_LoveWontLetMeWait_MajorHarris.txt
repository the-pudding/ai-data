9 ContributorsLove Wonâ€™t Let Me Wait Lyrics[Verse 1]
The time is right
You hold me tight
And love's got me high
Please tell me, yes (Yes)
And don't say no, honey
Not tonight
I need to have you
Next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave
Till I see the morning sun
Creep through your window pane
'Cause love won't let me wait
Not one more minute, baby

[Verse 2]
The time is right
Turned down the lights
And take my hand
We will take a flight
And spend the night
In a wonderland
Now, move a little
Close to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly
Take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait
No, listen girl
[Verse 3]
I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We will explode in ecstasy
And I won't take the blame
That love won't let me wait

[Outro]
No
Love won't let me wait
My temperature's rising (Love won't let me wait)
'Cause you're so tantalizing
Oh, listen, girl
Love won't let me wait
I'm guaranteed to inspire
Just let me take you higher (Love won't let me wait)
Oh, baby
And love won't let- (Love won't let me wait)
It won't let me wait, no, girl
Ain't it sweet? (Love won't let me wait)
Oh, baby, every time we meet
Oh, yeah
And love won't let- (Love won't let me wait)
It won't let me wait
No, no
Love won't let me wait
Love won't let- (Love won't let me wait)
It won't let me wait, listen, sugar
No, baby
Love won't let- (Love won't let me wait)
It won't let me wait, no, baby
No, no
Can't you feel the fire? (Love won't let me wait)
Of your love, I'm never tired
No, baby
'Cause love won't let me wait
My temperature's rising
'Cause you're so tantalizingEmbed
