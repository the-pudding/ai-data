Oh, come and dance (Oh)
With me, my baby
Let's dance till we
Go crazy (Go)
The night is young (The night's young)
And so are we
Let's make love (Oh, love)
And dance the night away

[Verse 1]
What I really wanna do
Is just dance with you
And feel your body tight
Show you how to do it right
I can show you every move
I know just what to do
Each step will feel so fine
One dance and you'll be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby, when we hit the floor
You'll be asking for more
Let's make love
And dance the night away
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, come and dance
With me, my baby (With me, my baby)
Let's dance till we (Dance)
Go crazy (Crazy)
The night is young (The night is young)
And so are we
Let's make love (Love)
And dance the night away

[Verse 2]
Oh, put your hand in mine
Promise I'll take my time
We'll dance from head to toe
I can dance fast or slow
Baby, look into my eyes
Let the music hypnotize
Let our bodies synchronize
One dance and you'll be mine (You'll be mine)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, when we hit the floor
You'll be asking for more
Let's make love
And dance the night away
[Chorus]
Oh, come and dance
With me, my baby (My baby)
Let's dance till we
Go crazy (Let's go crazy, let's go crazy)
The night is young
And so are we
Let's make love
And dance the night away (Oh)

[Bridge]
When it comes to dancing
I know how to move
When it comes to passion
I know just what to do
I feel the music inside
I feel like I am alive
The tempo is right
Let's make love

[Chorus]
Oh, come and dance (Dance with me)
With me, my baby (Till we go crazy)
Let's dance till we
Go crazy
The night is young (The night is young)
And so are we
Let's make love (Let's dance)
And dance the night away

Oh, come and dance
Let's dance

Let's make love (Love)
And dance the night away

Go crazy (Go crazy)
The night is young
And so are we (And so are we)
Let's make love (Love)
And dance the night away
Oh, come and dance (Baby, dance)
With me, my baby (With me, baby)
