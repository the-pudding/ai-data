Dim all the lights, sweet darling
'Cause tonight it's all the way
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away

[Verse-1]
Love just don't come easy
No, it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up

[Chorus]
Dim all the lights, sweet darling
'Cause tonight it's all the way, hey, baby
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away

Love just don't come easy
No, it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up

Dim all the lights, sweet honey
'Cause tonight it's you and me
No need to worry darlin'
'Cause it's for eternity
You might also like[Hook]
Love don't come easy
This you know I understand
Want to be your woman
If you'll be my man
Let yourself go freely and I'll
Show you things that you've dreamed of
Don't think that you're dreaming
We've found the perfect love
And I'm like a cup, come fill me up

[Chorus]
Dim all the lights, sweet darlin'
'Cause the night is on the way, oh, baby
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away

[Bridge]
Do what you want
You can use me all up
Take me bottom to top
Don't leave even one drop

[Interlude]
No, no, no do it tonight
You know the moment's so right
Turn my brown body white
Come on dim all the lights
[Outro Chorus]
(Dim all the lights) Dim all the lights, sweet darlin'
'Cause the night is on the way, hey, baby
(Dim all the lights) Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna steal your heart away, hey, baby

(Dim all the lights) Dim all the lights, sweet darlin'
(Dim all the lights) Dim it, dim it
(Dim all the lights) Dance the night away
(Dim all the lights) Dim all the lights, sweet honey
(Dim all the lights) Gonna steal your heart away

(Dim all the lights) Keep on dancing
(Dim all the lights) Dim all the lights, sweet darlin'
(Dim all the lights) Nothing, nothing can steal my heart away
(Dim all the lights)...Embed
