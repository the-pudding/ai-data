5 ContributorsTears on My Pillow Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't remember me, but I remember you
'Twas not so long ago, you broke my heart in two
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you, ooh (You)

[Verse 2]
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hand of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you

[Bridge]
Love is not a gadget, love is not a toy
When you find the one you love, she'll fill your heart with joy

[Verse 2]
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hand of fate
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you (You)

[Outro]
Oh wo wo wo you you
Wo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohYou might also like1Embed
