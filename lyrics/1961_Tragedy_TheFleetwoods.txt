Wind and storm
Gone's the sun
From the stars
My dark has come

[Chorus]
You've gone from me, whoa, whoa
Tragedy

[Verse 2]
Oh, come back (Come back)
Have me here (Come here)
Hold me love (My love)
Be sincere

[Chorus]
You've gone from me, whoa, whoa
Tragedy

[Verse 3]
Like smoke (Like smoke)
From a fire (From a fire)
Of love (of love), whoa
Our dreams (our dreams)
Have all gone (all gone)
Above (above), whoa
You might also like[Verse 4]
Blown by wind (blown by wind)
Kissed by the snow
All that's left is the dark
Below (below)

[Chorus]
You've gone from me, whoa, whoa
Tragedy
Whoa, whoa, whoa
