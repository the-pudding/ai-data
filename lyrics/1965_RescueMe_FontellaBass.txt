Or take me in your arms

I need you and your love too
Come on and rescue me

Can't you see that I'm lonely?

Take your love and conquer every part
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm blue
I need you and your love too
Come on and rescue me

Come on, baby, and rescue me
Come on, baby, and rescue me
'Cause I need you by my side
