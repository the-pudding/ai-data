15 ContributorsStill the Same Lyrics[Verse 1]
You always won every time you placed a bet
You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet
Every time they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk

[Verse 2]
You always said the cards would never do you wrong
The trick, you said, was never play the game too long
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

[Chorus]
And you're still the same, I caught up with you yesterday
(Still the same, still the same)
Moving game to game, no one standing in your way
Turning on the charm long enough to get you by
(Still the same, still the same)
You're still the same
You still aim high

[Verse 3]
(Still the same, still the same)
(Still the same, still the same)
There you stood, everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say
You might also like[Outro]
'Cause you're still the same (Still the same)
(Baby, babe, you're still the same)
You're still the same (Still the same)
(Baby, babe, you're still the same)
Moving game to game (Still the same)
(Baby, babe, you're still the same)
Some things never change (Still the same)
(Baby, babe, you're still the same)
Oh, you're still the same (Still the same)
(Baby, babe, you're still the same)
Still the same (Still the same)
(Baby, babe, you're still the same)2Embed
