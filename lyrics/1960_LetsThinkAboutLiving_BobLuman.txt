In every other song that I've heard lately some fellow gets shot
And his baby and his best friend both die with him as likely as not
In half of the other songs some cat's crying or ready to die
We've lost most of our happy people and I'm a-wondering why

[Chorus]
Let's think about living
Let's think about loving
Let's think about the whoopin'
And hoppin and boppin'
And the lovie, lovie dovin'
Let's forget about the whinin' and the cryin'
And the shooting and the dying
And the fellow with a switchblade knife
Let's think about living
Let's think about life

[Verse 2]
We lost old Marty Robbins down in old El Paso a little while back
And now Miss Patti Page or one of them is a-wearing black
Cathy's Clown's got Don and Phil where they feel like they could die
If we keep on a-losin' our singers like that I'll be the only one you can buy

[Chorus]
Think about living
Let's think about loving
Let's think about the whoopin'
And hoppin and boppin'
And the lovie, lovie dovin'
Let's forget about the whinin' and the cryin'
And the shooting and the dying
And the fellow with a switchblade knife
Let's think about living
Let's think about life
(Alright)

Let's think about living
Let's think about loving
Let's think about the whoopin'
And hoppin and boppin'
And the lovie, lovie dovin'
Let's forget about the whinin' and the cryin'
And the shooting and the dying
And the fellow with a switchblade knife
Let's think about living
Let's think about life
Now, let's go for it
Let's think about living
Let's think about loving
Let's think about the whoopin'
And hoppin and boppin'
And the lovie, lovie dovin'
Let's forget about the whinin' and the cryin'
And the shooting and the dying
And the fellow with a switchblade knife
Let's think about living
Let's think about life

[Outro]
Let's think about living
