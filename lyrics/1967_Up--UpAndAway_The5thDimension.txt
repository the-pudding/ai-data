10 ContributorsUp, Up and Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon?
Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I
For we can fly (we can fly)

[Chorus]
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

[Verse 2]
The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky
For we can fly (we can fly)

[Chorus]
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

[Bridge]
Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hide us
We'll keep the moon beside us
You might also like[Verse 3]
Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand we'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly (we can fly)

[Chorus]
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon
Balloon...

[Outro]
Up, up, and away
Up, up, and away
Up, up, and away...
[Fade out]
