[Verse 1]
These eyes
Cry every night
For you
These arms
Long to hold you
Again

[Bridge]
The hurtin's on me, yeah
And I will never be free
No, my baby, no no
You gave the promise to me, yeah
And you broke it
And you broke it, oh no
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
These eyes
Watched you bring my world
To an end
This heart
Could not accept
And pretend
