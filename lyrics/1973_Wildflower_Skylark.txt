8 ContributorsWildflower Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world
Was about to fall in

[Pre-Chorus]
Each time her slender shoulders
Bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence in her ears

[Chorus]
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream
For she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower
Growing wild

[Bridge]
And if by chance I should hold her
If by chance I should hold her
Let me hold her for a time!
Let me hold her for a time!
But, if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden
I would pick her from the garden
To be mine
To be mine

Be careful how you touch her
For she'll awaken
And sleep's the only freedom
That she knows
And when you walk into her eyes
You won't believe

[Pre-Chorus]
The way she's always paying
For a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows
That only she can hear and so she goes

[Chorus]
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream
For she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower
Growing wild
Let her cry for she's lady
Let her dream
For she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower
Growing wild
[Outro]
She's a flower
Growing wild
She's free
Growing wildEmbed
