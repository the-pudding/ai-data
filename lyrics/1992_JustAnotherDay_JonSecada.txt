10 ContributorsJust Another Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mornings alone
When you come home
I breathe a little faster
Every time we're together
It'd never be the same
(It’d never be the same)
If you're not here
How can you stay away, away so long?
Why can't we stay together?
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason

[Chorus]    
'Cause I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
It's just another day

[Verse 2]
Making the time
Find the right lines
To make you stay forever
What do I have to tell you?
I'm just trying to hold on to something
(Trying to hold on to something good)
Give us a chance to make it
No, no, no
Don't wanna hold on to never
I'm not that strong
I'm not that strong
You might also like[Chorus]
I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you, no

[Break]
Why can't you stay forever
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason

[Chorus]
I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Baby no
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you

I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you1Embed
