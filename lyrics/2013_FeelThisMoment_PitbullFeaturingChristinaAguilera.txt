Ask for money and get advice, huh
Ask for advice, get money twice, huh
I'm from the dirty, huh, but that chico nice, ha
Y'all call it a moment, I call it a life

[Pre-Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
One day while my light is glowin'
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I just wanna feel this moment
Woah-oh-oh-oh

Reporting live from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long ways from them hard ways, filled with zoes and oye's
Dade County always, 3-0-5, all day
And, now, baby, we can parlay or, baby, we can party (Heh)
She read books (Hahaha), especially about red rooms and tie-ups (Yeah)
I got her hooked, huh
'Cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up
Meet and greet, nice to meet ya
But time is money, only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dale

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I see the future but live for the moment
Make sense, don't it? Ha
Now make dollars, I mean billions (Yeah)
I'm a genius, I mean brilliant (Brilliant)
The streets is what schooled him (Schooled him)
And made him slicker than Slick Rick the Ruler (Yeah)
I've lost a lot and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated like Shula
I'm far from cheap (Ah-haha)
I break down companies with all my peeps (That's right)
Baby, we can travel the world
And I can give you and all you can see
Time is money, only difference is I own it
Like a stopwatch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dale
