[Verse 1: USHER & Lil Jon]
Up in the club with my homies
Tryna get a little V-I, keep it down on the low-key (Low-key)
'Cause you know how it is (Hey, hey)
I seen shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear, you would think that she know me (Know me)
I decided to chill (Okay)
Conversation got heavy (Hey)
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
Watch out! (Oh)
Watch out!
She was sayin', "Come get me" (Come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go" (Let's go)
When I told her, I said
See USHER LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like[Chorus: USHER, USHER & Lil Jon]

[Verse 2: USHER, Lil Jon & Both]
So she's all up in my head now
Got me thinkin' that it might be a good idea to take her with me (With me)
'Cause she's ready to leave (Ready to leave now; oh, let's go)
Now I gotta keep it real now (Yeah)
'Cause on a one-to-ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (Hey)
'Cause I don't know if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me (Hey, hey, hey)
The way she get low
I'm like, "Yeah, just work that out for me"
She asked for one more dance
And I'm like, "Yeah, how the hell am I supposed to leave?" And I said (Let's go, bring the beat back)

Yeah, yeah
Shawty got down low, she said, "Come and get me"

Yeah, yeah
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screamin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey, hey, Luda)

[Verse 3: Ludacris, Lil Jon & Both]
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club, lookin' so conspicuous
And raow, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in they birthday suit (Yeah)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag' and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin', then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go, ow)
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand?
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah)
Ludacris fill cups like double Ds (Yeah)
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say
[Chorus: USHER, USHER & Lil Jon]
Yeah, yeah
Shawty got down low, she said, "Come and get me"
Yeah, yeah
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah, yeah
Her and my girl used to be the best of homies
Yeah, yeah
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screamin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
