10 ContributorsI Say a Little Prayer Lyrics[Verse 1]
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you

[Chorus]
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

[Verse 2]
I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work, I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time
I say a little prayer for you

[Chorus]
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I say a little prayer for you
I say a little prayer for you

[Chorus]
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

[Outro]
My darling, believe me
For me there is no one but you
Please love me, too
I'm in love with you
Answer my prayer
Say you love me, too
Why don't you answer my prayer, yeah?
You know, every day I say a little prayer
I said I say, I say a little prayer
Why don't you just answer my prayer?Embed
