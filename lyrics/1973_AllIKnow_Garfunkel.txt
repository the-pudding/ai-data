9 ContributorsAll I Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
I bruise you, you bruise me
We both bruise too easily
Too easily to let it show
I love you, and that's all I know

[Verse 2]
All my plans have fallen through
All my plans depend on you
Depend on you to help them grow
I love you, and that's all I know

[Pre-Chorus]
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on...

[Chorus]
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast, but they pass to slow
I love you, and that's all I know

[Pre-Chorus]
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
It's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn
They say the darkest night
There's a light beyond
You might also like[Chorus]
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast, but they pass too slow
I love you, and that's all I know
That's all I know
That's all I know, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
