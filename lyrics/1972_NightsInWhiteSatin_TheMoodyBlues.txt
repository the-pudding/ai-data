Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is I can't say anymore

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you-oh

[Verse 2]
Gazing at people, some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through they can't understand
Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be you will be in the end

[Chorus]
And I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you

[Flute Solo]

[Verse 3]
Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I've always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is I can't say anymore
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you-oh
'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you-oh

[Late Lament: Graeme Edge]
Breathe deep the gathering gloom
Watch lights fade from every room
Bedsitter people look back and lament
Another day's useless energy spent
Impassioned lovers wrestle as one
Lonely man cries for love and has none
New mother picks up and suckles her son
Senior citizens wish they were young
Cold-hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colours from our sight
Red is grey and yellow, white
But we decide which is right
And which is an illusion10Embed
