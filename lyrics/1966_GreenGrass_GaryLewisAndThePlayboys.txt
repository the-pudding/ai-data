3 ContributorsGreen Grass Lyrics[Verse 1]
Green grass 'round my window
Young leaves that the wind blows
Yes, it's springtime
Golden sunshine
And we're glad my little love and I
Now, that summertime is nigh

[Verse 2]
Carefree kissin' couples
Dream away all their troubles
'Cause it's springtime
Golden sunshine
While the bluebirds sing their magic song
We will love the summer long

[Bridge]
All the winter we've been waitin'
Girl and I anticipatin'
What we're gonna do
With summer overdue
Now, it's here we're out together
So, the weatherman had better
Do his best to make it show
And bring the sunshine out to grow

The green grass 'round my window
Young leaves that the wind blows
'Yes, it's springtime
Golden sunshine
While the bluebirds sing their magic song
We will love the summer long

[Outro]
We will love the summer long
We will love the summer long
We will love the summer longEmbed
