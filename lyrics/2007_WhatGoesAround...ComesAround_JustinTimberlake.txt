This world's a fuckin big ben
Where the bullies of time increase your pain
My niggas count the money and pray the god
Pray the god to see tomorrow one more time
Mo hours mo minutes mo distress
Time is a poison which acts so slowly
No caress ,no kisses ,for the realest
Just blow,just cuts and that's it

My back 'gainst the wall
Hours all around me

My reason insensitive
But my heart feeling something

Tic toc tic tic toc
Time is so fast

Tic toc toc tic toc
You already in the past


What goes around comes around  justin timberlake
Time is in the same time my richness and my huge poverty
Minutes gives a rough ra to my pore head to my eyes man to my conscious to my reason
Im feelin the time ,im feelin the punch
I 'm runnin non stop after this kind of sand who's flow into my hand
My calcul control the world, my passion feelin it
My heart beat in the rythm,but my mind tyredYou might also likeEmbed
