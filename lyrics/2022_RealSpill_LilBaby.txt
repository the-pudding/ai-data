Only love could bring us
Bring us to this bitter plane

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm beneficial, I can't show no feelings, Bentley windows tinted
Nowadays ain't no time for me to kick it, business to attend to
They gon' say that I been actin' different, I'm beyond they mental
I moved on from slangin' drugs and pistols, can't be thinkin' simple
Tighten up my circle, someone in the camp been leakin' info
The Maybach triple black, this shit relaxin', feel like I'm in a limo
I pull through the hood to let 'em see, I let down all the windows
I know I'm the motivation, they see me, they see a hero
Lot of niggas rich, but it hit different when you come from zero
They know I bang C's but every day I need a different B roll
Super supertitious, ask my niggas, I still pick up pennies
You can't give attention to these bitches when your name get mentioned
If I don't kill him, he gon' be in critical condition when I'm finished with him
Some shit just can't faze you when you been that nigga
Brodie died, that shit had me all sentimental
Cuz got life in jail, I pray to God they overturn his sentence

[Chorus]
I got too much money for my mom to work a job, I know she proud now
Sensei to these bitches, when they see me, they gon' bow down
I made real niggas win again, we back in style now
And I got that blicky for that rah-rah
I go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop
My new house got slidin' glass doors, don't got no doorknobs
I'm in charge, I'm always gon' go hard, you just do your part
And no matter what, know if you get up, then you lose your spot

You can say whatever but if I change it's for the better
That shit was painful but I ain't let up, I left a stain in the ghetto
Been inside the mix since a lil' jit, got my name from the ghetto
But I'm bigger now I can go to dinner with Corey Gamble and Miss Jenner now
Couple hundred grand up on the 'Gram before it went in style
They'll call me like, "Take it down", I been the one
Bossed up, I don't gotta do it, but I'ma get her done
I man up and handle my problems when I can easily run
Easy come, easy go, sell it all, get some more
We done made it to another year, I'm swappin' out my cars again
Everything is the latest, can't complain 'cause I made it
Who am I gon' judge?
I don't never hold nuts, I don't never hold grudges
Went to Miami for a concert, hit Chanel store for my baby
I spent three hundred on a Mercedes, if I keep goin', I'll be the greatest
I bust out cryin' and I wasn't sad, it's just a little feelin' you get when you make it
I done tried, tried, tried and tried and tried again, I can't even fake it, yeah

[Chorus]
I got too much money for my mom to work a job, I know she proud now
Sensei to these bitches, when they see me, they gon' bow down
I made real niggas win again, we back in style now
And I got that blicky for that rah-rah
I go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop
My new house got slidin' glass doors, don't got no doorknobs
I'm in charge, I'm always gon' go hard, you just do your part
And no matter what, know if you get up, then you lose your spot
[Outro]
Only one of us
Who's gonna walk away?
Here in the deep below
That only darkness really knows2Embed
