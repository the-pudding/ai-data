6 ContributorsHave I the Right Lyrics{Intro}

[Verse 1]
Have I the right to hold you?
You know I've always told you
That we must never ever part
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Have I the right to kiss you?
You know I'll always miss you
I've loved you from the very start

[Chorus]
Come right back, I just can't bear it
I've got some love, and I long to share it
Come right back, I'll show my love is strong
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Have I the right to touch you?
If I could you'd see how much you
Send those shivers running down my spine
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Have I the right to thrill you?
You know I'll wait until you
Give me the right to make you mine
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, come right back, I just can't bear it
I've got some love, and I long to share it
Come right back, I'll show my love is strong
Oh yeah
Alright!
