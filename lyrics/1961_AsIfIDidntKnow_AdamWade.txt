1 ContributorAs If I Didn’t Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
You swore to me
You were my one and only
Though deep inside
I knew it wasn't true
Since you've been gone
My days are cold and lonely
I just can't seem
To want somebody new

[Chorus]
As if I didn't know
That you were lying
And that your game of love
Would cause me woe
In spite of all the times
You left me crying
I played your game
As if I didn't know

[Verse 2]
They warned me that someday
I'd learn a lesson
And that a broken heart
Would be the cause
Believе me when I say
That I'm confessing
I'm glad I lovеd you
Even though I lost
You might also like[Chorus]
As if I didn't know
Someday you'd hurt me
As if I couldn't tell
You'd grieve me so
And even though it's true
You did desert me
I still love you
As if I didn't know

[Outro]
I still love you
As if I didn't knowEmbed
