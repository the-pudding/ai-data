I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined
See Flo Rida LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like[Chorus: Kelli-Leigh with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Champagne bucket still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all, get a meal ticket
Kleenex, get a call, just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the boss staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell them Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck and Lee Prince's parents
Buy my momma chandeliers, I'm in tears, dammit
Thirty years you'd have thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanished
No cheers, I know you woulda panicked
[Chorus: Kelli-Leigh with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
[Post-Chorus: Kelli-Leigh with Flo Rida]
I know
I know
I know
I know
I, I, I, I
I think of letting go, go, go
[Chorus: Kelli-Leigh with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go15Embed
