Ah
Yeah, woo
Hey, yeah, ah
Ooh, yeah, uh-huh
Yeah
I wanna dance

[Verse 1]
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

[Pre-Chorus]
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
The loneliness calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
You might also like[Verse 2]
I've been in love and lost to my senses
Spinnin' through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feelin' down

[Pre-Chorus]
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Bridge]
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me, yeah
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in his arms, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh (Dance)
Come on, baby (Dance)
Woo, yeah (Dance)
Now get with this, woah (Dance)
Don't you wanna dance (Dance) with me, baby?
Don't you wanna dance (Dance) with me, boy?
Hey, don't you wanna dance (Dance) with me, baby?
With somebody who loves me
Don't you wanna dance? Say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance? (Dance)
Don't you wanna dance? Say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance? (Dance)
Don't you wanna dance? Say you wanna dance
Uh-huh (Dance)
With somebody who loves me
Ooh, ooh (Dance)
Ooh, ooh (Dance)
Ooh, ooh (Dance)
Hey, baby
Don't you wanna love, don't you wanna love me?22Embed
