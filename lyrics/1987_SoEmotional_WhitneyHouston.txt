19 ContributorsSo Emotional Lyrics[Intro]
I don't know why I like it, huh
I just do
Woo, ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I've been hearin' your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photo right beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head, uh
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good?
I got a love of my own, babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much
Ah, uh

[Chorus]
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do? Hee

[Verse 2]
I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out, yes, I do
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk, I just watch your mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much
Ooh

[Chorus]
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking, love can do
Hee-hee
[Interlude]
Uh
Ha
Can you work on me? Work on me
Haha

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much
No, no, no

[Chorus]
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

[Outro]
I get so emotional
I get so emotional, baby (Oh, baby)
Shocking what love can do (Do-do-do-do-do)
I get so emotional, baby (Hey, yeah, baby, baby, baby)
Every time I think of you (Baby, baby, baby)
I get so emotional, baby (Oh)
Ain't it shocking what love can do? You know what it does
I get so emotional, baby (Yeah, babe, yeah, baby)
Every time I think of you (You know what I mean, hee, hee, hoo)
I get so emotional, baby (Hey, yeah, baby)
Shocking what love can do, ooh-ooh5Embed
