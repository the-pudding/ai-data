13 ContributorsSorry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I had a lot to say
Was thinking on my time away
I missed you and things weren't the same

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry, it makes me wanna die

[Chorus]
I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know, I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby, the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
This time, I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
You get older and blame turns to shame

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry, it makes me wanna die

[Bridge]
Every single day
I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights and the tears you cried
It's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know, I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby, the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry
