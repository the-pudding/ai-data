2 ContributorsYou Made Me Believe in Magic LyricsI believe that love has gone
I've no strength to carry on
Thought my world was upside down

Then you walked on to my life
Went to work to set things right
What's the secret that you, that you use

You made me believe in magic
You know that I can be true to your love
You made me believe in magic
Your love's put magic into my life

Now I'm filled with new sense to be
You gave my life harmony
Loving you is all I, all I need

You made me believe in magic
You know that I can be true to your love
You made me believe in magic
Your love's put magic into my lifeYou might also likeEmbed
