12 ContributorsPoetry in Motion LyricsWhen I see my baby, what do I see
Poetry, poetry in motion

Poetry in motion, walkin' by my side
Her lovely locomotion keeps my eyes open wide
Poetry in motion, see her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean could never move that way

I love every movement
There’s nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement
She's much too nice to rearrange

Poetry in motion, dancing close to me
A flower of devotion swaying gracefully

Oh, a-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
A-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
A-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
A-whoa
Poetry in motion, see her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean could never move that way

I love every movement
There’s nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement
She's much too nice to rearrange
You might also likePoetry in motion, all that I adore
No number nine love potion could make me love her more

Oh, a-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
A-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
A-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
A-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa1Embed
