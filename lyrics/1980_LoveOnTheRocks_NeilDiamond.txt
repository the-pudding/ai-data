Ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink and I'll tell you some lies
Got nothing to lose
So you just sing the blues all the time

Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here with nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile

First, they say they want you
Indeed, how they really need you
Suddenly, you find you're out there walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do when the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold when your love's on the rocks
You might also likeFirst, they say they want you
Indeed, how they really need you
Suddenly. you find you're out there walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

Love on the rocks
Ain't no big surprise
Just pour me a drink and I'll tell you more lies
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smileEmbed
