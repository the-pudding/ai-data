You caught me fooling around now I'm losing you

'Cause you're a one man woman
You're a one man woman
You're a one man woman
But I'm a two timing man

The nights you left me alone
And you disappeared
The nights your voice on the phone
Said, I'm waiting here

'Cause I'm a one man woman
Yes, you're a one man woman
'Cause I'm a one man woman
But I'm a two timing man

Oh, baby, you know I'm sorry
Oh sure, it's the same old story
I keep coming back and I let you
'Cause I'd rather forgive than forget you

Now I won't need no chains to tie me down
You lost you're way my love, but now you've found

Yes, you're a one man woman
Oh, I'm a one man woman
But I'm a two timing man

I'm a one man woman
I'll be your one woman man
You're a one man woman
I'm a one woman man

Yes, you're a one man woman
You're a one woman man[unverified]Embed
