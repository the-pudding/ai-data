13 ContributorsHurting Each Other Lyrics[Verse 1]
No one in the world
Ever had a love as sweet as my love
For nowhere in the world
Could there be a boy as true as you, love

[Pre-Chorus]
All my love I give gladly to you
All your love you give gladly to me
Tell me why then, oh why should it be that

[Chorus]
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Hurting each other
Without ever knowing why

[Verse 2]
Closer than the leaves
On a weeping willow, baby, we are
Closer, dear, are we
Than the simple letters A and B are

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life I could love only you
All your life you could love only me
Tell me why then, oh why should it be that
You might also like[Chorus]
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Hurting each other
Without ever knowing why

[Bridge]
Can't we stop hurting each other?
Got to stop hurting each other
Making each other cry
Breaking each other's heart
Tearing each other apart
Can't we stop hurting each other?
Got to stop hurting each other
Making each other cry
Breaking each other's heart
Tearing each other apart

[Outro]
Can't we stop hurting each other?... (fade)1Embed
