8 ContributorsThe Most Beautiful Girl Lyrics[Chorus]
Hey, did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did, was she crying, crying
Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

[Verse]
I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun
I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartache that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

[Chorus]
So hey, did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did, was she crying, crying
Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

Did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her...1Embed
