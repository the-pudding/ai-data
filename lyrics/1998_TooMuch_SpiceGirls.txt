18 ContributorsToo Much Lyrics[Verse 1: Scary & Baby]
Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep but meaningless words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end

[Pre-Chorus: Sporty]
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (pleases me)
But short term solution ain't no resolution
That ain't no release for me

[Chorus: All]
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

[Verse 2: Ginger & Posh]
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast

[Pre-Chorus: Sporty]
Yes my dear you know he soothes me (Moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me
You might also like[Chorus: All]
Too much of something is bad enough (Bad enough)
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough (Just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

[Bridge: Sporty]
What part of no don't you understand
(Understand, understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can

[Chorus: All]
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

[Outro: All]
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie3Embed
