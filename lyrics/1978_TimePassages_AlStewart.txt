10 ContributorsTime Passages Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was late in December, the sky turned to snow
All round the day was goin' down slow
Night like a river beginning to flow
I felt the beat of my mind go
Drifting into

[Chorus]
Time passages
Years go falling in the fading light
Time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I'm not the kind to live in the past
The years run too short and the days too fast
The things you lean on, are the things that don't last
Well it's just now and then, my line gets cast into these

[Chorus]
Time passages
There's something back here that you left behind
Oh, time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

[Bridge]
Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

[Verse 3]
Well the picture is changing, now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something, and the music's loud
A girl comes towards you, you once used to know
You reach out your hand, but you're all alone in these

[Chorus]
Time passages
I know you're in there, you're just out of sight
Oh, time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonightEmbed
