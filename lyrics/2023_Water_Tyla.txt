Make me sweat, make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water
Make me sweat, make me hotter
Make me lose my breath, make me water

[Verse 1]
Normally, I can keep my cool
But tonight, I'm wildin'
I'ma be (Yeah) in a dangerous mood
Can you match my timing? (Mm, mm)
Tellin' me (Yeah) that you really 'bout it
Why try hide it? Ooh
Talk is cheap, so show me
That you understand how I like it

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time (Ooh)
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body, whole body

Make me lose my breath, make me water

Hopefully you can last all night
Don't get too excited (Ooh)
Oh, privacy (Mm), you ain't gotta go nowhere
You can stay inside it

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you blow my mind? (Oh)
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time (If I give you my time)
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before (Before)
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body, whole body (Haibo)
