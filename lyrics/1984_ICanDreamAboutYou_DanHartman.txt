21 ContributorsI Can Dream About You Lyrics[Verse 1]
No more timing
Each tear that falls from my eyes
I`m not hiding the remedy
To cure this old heart of mine

[Chorus]
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

[Verse 2]
Moving sidewalks
I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from down here below
Where the streets
See me lonely for you, oh

[Chorus]
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
You might also like[Verse 3]
(I can dream about you)
I'm gonna press
My lips against you
And hold you to me
(I can dream about you)
You know you got me
Spellbound
What else can it be?

Moving sidewalks
I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from the pain in my heart
Cause it's you that I need

I can dream
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh
I can dream
Yes, I can dream
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh

I don't understand it
Can't keep my mind off loving you
(Not even for a minute)
Oooh
Now baby
I'm caught up in the magic
I see in you
There's one thing to do

[Chorus]
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

Oh, I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
Oh, I can dream
I can dream
I can dream about you
I can dream about youEmbed
