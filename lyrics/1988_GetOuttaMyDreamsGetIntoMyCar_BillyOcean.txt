Hey you, get into my car! Who me?
Yes you, get into my car
Woooooooooh. Wah! Hey

[Verse 1]
Who's that lady coming down the road?
Who's that lady?
Who's that woman walking through my door?
What's the score?
I'll be the sun shining on you
Hey Cinderella, step in your shoe
I'll be your nonstop lover
Get it while you can
Your nonstop miracle, I'm your man

[Chorus]
Get outta my dreams
Get into my car
Get outta my dreams
(Get in the back seat, baby)
Get into my car
(Beep beep, yeah)
Get outta my mind
Get into my life
(Ooooooh)
Oh I said hey (Hey) you (You)
Get into my car
Oh baby

Get it while you can
Your nonstop miracle
