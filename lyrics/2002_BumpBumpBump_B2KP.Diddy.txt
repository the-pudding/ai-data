26 ContributorsBump, Bump, Bump Lyrics[Intro: P. Diddy & B2K]
We sending this one out to all the ladies all over the world
All my sexy mamas
Come on, come on, and come on now
As we proceed, to give you what you need
You know I like it when your body go
Bump, bump, bump
Bad Boy, B2K
Yo, O, talk to 'em, playa

[Verse 1: Omarion & (P. Diddy)]
I like your little sexy style
Love it when you getting wild
Girl in the club with me
(Come over here, let me talk to you for a minute)
(I gotta tell you something)
Girl, you need to be in magazines
Wear a crown on your head, 'cause you's a ghetto queen
Like bling bling bling
(Come on, you fine, girl)
The way you're shaking that sexy ass
Body shaped like an hourglass
Baby, we need to spend some time
(Yeah, let's do it, y'all)
I wanna get you to myself
You and me and nobody else
And do the things we do
Maybe there is something that I need from you
(Come on)
You might also like[Chorus: B2K & Omarion & (P. Diddy)]
Baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump
That is all I want to see
Baby, show me, show me
Baby turn around and let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump
The way you're throwing that thing at me
I can't take it, baby
(Second verse, come on)

[Verse 2: Omarion & (P. Diddy)]
You know that you're teasing me
Gonna have to stop pleasing me
While we're on this floor
(Stop teasing, baby, I want you)
You're kicking it round and round
I love the way you put it down
You're making me scream for more
(Give me more, let's go, don't stop, come on)
Put your two way next to mine
Baby, you me anytime
You and me behind closed doors
(Yeah, talk to me now)
You about to be my main squeeze
Take trips, cop shiny things
(Just me and you)
Girl, just come with me, oh-oh
Now, mama, go 'head, do the damn thing
[Chorus: B2K & Omarion & (P. Diddy)]
Baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump
That is all I want to see
Baby, show me, show me
(I like this, come on)
Baby turn around and let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump
The way you're throwing that thing at me
I can't take it, baby
(Yeah, this is Bad Boy, baby, check this out)
(Call me Diddy)

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
Dance for nothing, mommy, plans to take her by me
Get on the floor, make it bump more, shake it, mommy
Let's ride, I'm your Clyde, you can be my Bonnie
See you the type for me, mommy, so right for me
Man, she can move it, love when she dance to the music
Make me wanna stand like a pool stick
Hands is the smoothest, just a simple touch make me lose it
Girl, that's enough, stop movin'
I bump that, I pump that, girl, bring it to me, bump that
I want that, girl, sing it with me like
(Da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da)
(Da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da)
So let's do it again, mommy, you and a friend, mommy
Money ain't a thing, look, what I gotta spend, mommy?
Put up your hands for me, that's how you dance for me
Shake it like you can, honey, take it from your man, mommy
[Outro: B2K & Omarion & (P. Diddy)]
Baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump
That is all I want to see
Baby, show me, show me
Baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go
(B2K, Bad Boy, they call me Diddy, yeah)
Bump, bump, bump
(Dave Mac, you got one now, baby)
(Don't stop, come on, ha)
(I see you, Chris)
(You know I like it when your body goes)
Bump, bump, bump
(Come on, don't stop, let's go)
(Let's go, come on, ha-ha, let's go)
Baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go
(You know what it is)
Bump, bump, bump
(Come on, let's go, come on, let's go)
(And another one)
(You know I like it when your body goes)
Bump, bump, bump
(Come on, it's "Pandemonium", baby)
(Let's go, yeah, come on, let's go)5Embed
