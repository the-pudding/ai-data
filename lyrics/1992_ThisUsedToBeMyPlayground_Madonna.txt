This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 1]
Don't look back, keep your head held high, don't ask them why
Because life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking, don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 2]
No regrets, but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet, I can see your face In our secret place
You're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)
You might also like[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me1Embed
