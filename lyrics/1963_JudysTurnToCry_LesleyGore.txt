'Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me

[Verse 1]
Oh, when Judy left with Johnny at my party (My party)
And came back wearing his ring
I sat down and cried my eyes out
Now that was a foolish thing

[Chorus]
'Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me

[Verse 2]
Well, it hurt me so to see them dance together (Together)
I felt like making a scene
Then my tears just fell like rain drops
'Cause Judy's smile was so mean

[Chorus]
But now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me

[Verse 3]
Oh, one night I saw them kissing at a party (A party)
So I kissed some other guy
Johnny jumped up and he hit him
'Cause he still loves me, that's why

[Chorus]
So now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me

[Chorus (Fade)]
Yay, now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me2Embed
