21 ContributorsCanâ€™t Let Go Lyrics[Intro]
I can't let go, oh baby
Oooh, oh yea
Oh yea

[Verse 1]
There you are, holding her hand
I am lost
Dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right?
Don't you know you were my life?

[Chorus]
Even though I try, I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go

[Verse 2]
Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am, still holding on
I can't accept my world is gone (No, no)
You might also like[Chorus]
Even though I try, I can't let go
'Cause something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go

[Bridge]
Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside
Every day of my life?
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies?
I try and try to deny that I need you
But still, you remain on my mind

[Chorus]
Even though I try, I can't let go
(No, I just can't get you out of my mind)
Something in your eyes captured my soul
(I never can say goodbye)
'Cause every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let you go
Even though I try, I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
(Of something that I need so badly)
Every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go4Embed
