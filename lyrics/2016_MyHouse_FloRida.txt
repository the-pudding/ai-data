Open up the champagne, pop!
It's my house, come on, turn it up

[Verse 1]
Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
'Cause we done this before, so you come on in
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in

[Chorus]
Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out
[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house

[Verse 2]
Morning comes and you know that you wanna stay
Close the blinds, let's pretend that the time has changed
Keep our clothes on the floor, open up champagne
Let's continue tonight, come on, celebrate (That's how we do)

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live (You know where I live)
Yeah, you know what we is (You know what we is)
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in (In, in)

[Chorus]
Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now (Now)
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out (Out, out)
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud (Turn it up, turn it up)
Show me what you do now (Show me now)
We don't have to go out (Go out, go out, uh)
[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to my house (It's my house, come on, bring a friend)
Welcome to my house

[Verse 3]
Welcome to my duck-off, the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home's draining the sad
Soon as these happy faces land you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown pass
Mi casa es tu casa, so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax

[Chorus]
Welcome to my house
Baby (Hey), take control now (Woo, woo)
We can't even slow down (Hit the brakes, hit the brakes, go out)
We don't have to go out (Cheers to this)
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud (Turn it up)
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out (Go out)

[Post-Chorus]
(Ayy, ayy) Welcome to my house
(Ayy, ayy) Welcome to my house (It's my house, my house)
(Ayy, ayy) Welcome to my house (What?)
