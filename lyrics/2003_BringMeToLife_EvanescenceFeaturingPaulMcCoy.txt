How can you see into my eyes
Like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb

[Pre-Chorus: Amy Lee]
Without a soul (Soul)
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

[Chorus: Paul McCoy, Amy Lee]
Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

[Verse 2: Amy Lee]
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me (Ooh, oh)
Breathe into me and make me real (Make me real)
Bring (Bring) me (Me) to life

Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

[Post-Chorus: Amy Lee, Paul McCoy]
Bring me to life
I've been livin' a lie
There's nothing inside
Bring me to life

[Bridge: Amy Lee]
Frozen inside (Frozen inside)
Without your touch (Without your love)
Without your love, darling
Only you (Only you) are the life (Life) among the dead
[Verse 3: Paul McCoy, Amy Lee]
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

[Chorus: Paul McCoy, Amy Lee]
Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

[Post-Chorus: Amy Lee, Paul McCoy]
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie (Bring me to life)
There's nothing inside (There's nothing inside)
Bring me to life124Embed
