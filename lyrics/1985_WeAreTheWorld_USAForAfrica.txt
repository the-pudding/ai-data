There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

[Verse 2: Kenny Rogers, James Ingram, Tina Turner, Billy Joel]
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need

[Chorus: Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Both]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true, we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Verse 3: Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson, Al Jarreau, Dionne Warwick & Willie Nelson]
Well, send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand

[Bridge: Michael Jackson, Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper, Kim Carnes]
When you're down and out, and there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe, there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well
Let us realize, oh, that a change can only come
When we stand together as one (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
