1 ContributorSchool Is Out Lyrics[Intro]
A-one, a-two, a-one two three four

[Verse]
No more books and studies
And I can stay out late with my buddies
I can do the things that I want to do
'Cause all my exams are through
I can root for the Yankees from the bleachers
And don't have to worry 'bout teachers
And I'm so glad that school is out
I could sing and shout!

[Chorus]
(School is out) Everybody gonna have some fun
(School is out) Everybody gonna jump and run
(School is out) Come on people don't you be late
(School is out) I just got time to take my girl out on a date
School is out at last
And I'm so glad I passed
So everybody come and go with me!
We're gonna have a night with Daddy G
Ah-blow Daddy!

[Saxophone Solo]
Ah-that's great!
Let's celebrate!
I'll play it real good now
I'll do the [?]
Oh yeah!
The party's there!

And I'm so glad I passed

We're gonna have a night with Daddy G
Go Daddy!

Blow, blow Daddy
Oh that's great
Ah come on, come on
Yeah, oh yeah

(School is out) Oh yeah, that's really great
