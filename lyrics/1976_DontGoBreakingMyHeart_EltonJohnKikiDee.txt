Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh, honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh, honey, when you knocked on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Elton John, Kiki Dee]
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down, I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start, I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee, Both]
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

[Verse 2: Elton John & Kiki Dee]
Nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us, babe
Oh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Both, Elton John, Kiki Dee]
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down, I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start, I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee, Both]
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Elton John, Kiki Dee]
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down, I was your clown
Right from the start, I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John & Kiki Dee]
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my, don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my, don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart…9Embed
