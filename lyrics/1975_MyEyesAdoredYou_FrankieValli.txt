[Chorus]
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me, you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

[Verse 1]
Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be

[Verse 2]
Walking home every day, over
Barnegat Bridge and Bay
'Til we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

[Chorus]
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far
You might also like[Verse 3]
Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name

[Verse 4]
Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

[Chorus]
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

[Bridge]
All my life I will remember
How warm and tender we were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets
I know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away...)2Embed
