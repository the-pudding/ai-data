6 ContributorsEvery Beat Of My Heart Lyrics[Chorus]
In every beat of my heart
There's a beat for you
In every toast of wine
There's a toast for you

[Verse]
In all my conversation
You're my inspiration
And everything I do
I do for you

[Chorus]
Although we're so far apart
My love is true (True), true, true
In every beat of my heart
There's a beat for you

[Outro]
(In every beat of my heart)
