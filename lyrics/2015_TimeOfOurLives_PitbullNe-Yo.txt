61 ContributorsTime of Our Lives Lyrics[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago (Hey)
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though (Woo)
But I got just enough to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah (Mr. Worldwide), oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life (Ne-yo), hey, hey, hey
Let's get it now

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
This the last twenty dollars I got
But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender, "Line up some shots"
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
And told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk (Hey), dirty dance (Hey)
She a freaky girl (Hey) and I'm a freaky man (Hey)
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, "Wanna ride out?" And she said, "Yes"
We didn't go to church but I got blessed

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah, oh, baby

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Tonight, I'ma lose my mind
Better get yours 'cause I'm gon' get mine
Party every night like my last
Mami know the drill, shake that ass
Go ahead, baby, let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back, to the front, to the top
You know me, I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel lookin' for a nut
This is a fo' sho, I'm not talkin' 'bout luck
I'm not talkin' 'bout love, I'm talkin' 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up
[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah, oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life, hey, hey, hey

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
Everybody goin' through something
(Everybody goin' through something)
I said, everybody goin' through something
(Everybody goin' through something)
So you might as well roll it up
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight
I said, everybody goin' through something
(Everybody goin' through something)
Ayy, said, everybody goin' through something
(Everybody goin' through something)
So you might as well roll it up
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight, oh, yeah, yeah
[Interlude: Pitbull]
This for everybody going through tough times
Believe me, been there, done that
But every day above ground is a great day, remember that
