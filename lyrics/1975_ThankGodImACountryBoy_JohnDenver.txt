Well, life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
I thank God I'm a country boy
Well, a simple kind of life never did me no harm
A-raisin' me a family and working on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me ole fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Verse 2]
When the work's all done and the sun's settin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play "Sally Goodin'" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
I thank God I'm a country boy
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me ole fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy, woo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money-hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy
Yeah, city folk driving in a black limousine
A lot of sad people thinking that's a-mighty keen
Well, son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean
I thank God I'm a country boy
[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me ole fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Fiddle Solo]
[Verse 4]
Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, "Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy"
Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work, to play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy

[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me ole fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Woo, thank God I'm a country boy, yes3Embed
