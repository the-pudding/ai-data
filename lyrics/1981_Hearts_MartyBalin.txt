5 ContributorsHearts Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is everything all right?
I just called to say how lost
I feel without you
Miles away
I really can't believe I'm here and how I still care
About you?

[Chorus]
Hearts can break
And never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way

[Verse 2]
Is everything the same?
Do you ever think of me and how we loved
One another?
Will you change your mind?
Will you want me back again or have you found yourself
A new lover?

[Chorus]
Hearts can break
And never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
You might also like[Verse 3]
Is everything okay?
I just thought I'd write a song to tell the world
How I miss you?
'Cuz each and every day
I think of all the words I never said and all the chances
That I had to

[Chorus]
Hearts can break
And never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be

[Outro]
Is everything all right?1Embed
