Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called "Love"

[Verse 2]
Let me tell ya 'bout the stars in the sky
And a girl and a guy
And the way they could kiss
On a night like this

[Chorus]
When I look into your big brown eyes
It's so very plain to see
That it's time you learned about the facts of life
Starting from A to Z

[Verse 3]
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called "Love" (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
When I look into your big brown eyes
It's so very plain to see
That it's time you learned about the facts of life
Starting from A to Z
You might also like[Verse 4]
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called "Love"

[Verse 5]
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees

[Outro]
'Bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the treesEmbed
