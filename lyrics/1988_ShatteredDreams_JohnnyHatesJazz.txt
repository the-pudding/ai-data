12 ContributorsShattered Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
So much for your promises
They died the day you let me go
Caught up in a web of lies
But it was just too late to know

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought it was you
Who would stand by my side

[Chorus]
And now you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart

[Post-Chorus]
You said you'd die for me

[Verse 2]
Woke up to reality
And found the future not so bright
I dreamt the impossible
That maybe things could work out right

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought it was you
Who would do me no wrong
You might also like[Chorus]
And now you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart
You've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart

[Bridge]
From this empty heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought it was you
Who said they'd die for love

[Chorus]
And now you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart
You've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart
[Outro]
Oh, no, no, no
You said you'd die for me
Oh, oh, die for me
So much for your promises
So much for your promisesEmbed
