I get up, I get down
And I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge
Still, I'm not feeling grown
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)

[Chorus]
So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang (Come hang)
Let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try so whatever
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!

Feel like I'm gonna puke
'Cause my taxes are due
Do my password begin with a one or a two?
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow

Man, I'm up to somethin' (Up to somethin')
Oo-dee-la-dee-doe
Thank you all for comin' (All for comin')
I hope you like the show

So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody

Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (Come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang)
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang, bang)
