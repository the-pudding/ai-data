Does he love me?
I wanna know
How can I tell if he loves me so?

[Chorus]
Is it in his eyes?
Oh, no! You'll be deceived
Is it in his eyes?
Oh, no! He'll make believe
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is? Oh, yeah!
Or is it in his face?
Oh, no! It's just his charm
In his one embrace?
Oh, no! That's just his arm?
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is?
Oh! Oh! It's in his kiss
That's where it is?

[Verse]
Oh! Oh! Oh! Kiss him and squeeze him tight
And find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss
You might also like[Chorus]
How about the way he acts?
Oh, no! That's not the way?
And you're not listening to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is?
Oh, yeah! It's in his kiss
That's where it is?

[Bridge]
Whoa! Oh! Oh! Kiss him and squeeze him tight
And find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss

[Chorus]
How about the way he acts?
Oh, no! That's not the way?
And you're not listening to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is?
Oh, yeah! It's in his kiss
That's where it is?
[Outro]
Oh! Oh! It's in his kiss
That's where it is?Embed
