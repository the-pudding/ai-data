3 ContributorsRockinâ€™ Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna jump but I'm afraid I'll fall
I wanna holler but the joint's too small

[Refrain]
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

[Verse 2]
Want some lovin', babe, and that ain't all
I wanna kiss her but she's way too tall

[Refrain]
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

[Verse 3]
Wanna squeeze her but I'm way too low
I would be runnin' but my feets too slow

[Refrain]
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

[Instrumental Break]

I wanna squeeze her but I'm way too low
I would be runnin' but my feets too slow

[Refrain]
Young man rhythm got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

[Verse 5]
Baby comin', now I'm hurryin' home
I know she's leavin' 'cause I'm takin' too long

[Refrain]
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

[Outro]
Say it again
My rockin' pneumonia, ooh
