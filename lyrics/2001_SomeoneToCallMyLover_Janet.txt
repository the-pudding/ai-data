Back on the road again, feeling kinda lonely
And looking for the right guy who'd be mine
Friends say I'm crazy 'cause easily I fall in love
"You gotta do it different, J, this time"

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the one
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams, maybe

[Chorus]
Alright, maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah, baby, come on
Alright, baby, come and pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah, baby, come on

[Verse 2]
I spoil them when I'm in love
Givin' them what they dream of
Sometimes it's not a good thing but I'm blind
I love hard with everything
Givin' my all more than they
I'll take my friends' advice this time
I'll do it differently

My, my, looking for a guy, guy
I don't want him too shy
But he's gotta have the qualities
That I like in a man
Strong, smart, affectionate
He's gotta be all for me
And I'll be too, you see happily
