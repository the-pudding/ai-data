9 ContributorsYou Decorated My Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changing moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face

[Chorus]
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

[Verse 2]
Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me, until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see, all the things life can be, shining soft in your eyes

[Chorus Outro]
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my lifeYou might also likeEmbed
