6 ContributorsTired of Toein’ the Line Lyrics[Chorus:]
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Don't know why you wanna jump on me
Baby, baby, baby
You're making me cry

[Verse 1:]
Baby, I
I'm gonna find myself someone new
Someone who will be true
And no more toein' the line

I know it's over
Cause I see the signs
Don't let me waste your precious time

Baby
I'm tired of toeing the line
If you want to get rid of me
Baby, baby, baby
You're doing fine

[Verse 2:]
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
I'm gonna put on my walking shoes
And leave you far behind
You might also likeYou're rolling over
And over so divine
But you can't fix this broken heart of mine

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the lineEmbed
