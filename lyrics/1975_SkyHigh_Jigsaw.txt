[Verse 1]
Blown (blown blown blown)
'Round by the wind
Thrown (thrown thrown thrown)
Down in a spin

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you love, I thought that we
Had made it to the top
I gave you all I have to give
Why did it have to stop?

[Chorus]
You've blown it all sky high
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why
You've blown it all sky high
You, you've blown it all sky high
Our love had wings to fly
We could have touched the sky
You've blown it all sky high

[Verse 2]
Up (up up up)
Round I have flown
Then down (down down down)
Down like a stone
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you love, I thought that we
Had made it to the top
I gave you all I have to give
Why did it have to stop?

[Chorus]
You've blown it all sky high
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why
You've blown it all sky high
You, you've blown it all sky high
Our love had wings to fly
We could have touched the sky
You've blown it all sky high

[Outro]
You, you've blown it all sky high
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why
You've blown it all sky high2Embed
