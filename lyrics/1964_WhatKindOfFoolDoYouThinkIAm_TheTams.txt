(What kind of fool, what kind of fool)

[Verse 1]
What kind of fool do you think I am?
You think you can go on seein' him
Darling, after we had made our plans
You said I'd be your number one man

[Hook]
(What kind of fool) Do you think I am?
Do you think I am, now?
Do you think I am?

[Verse 2]
What kind of fool did you think I'd be?
You said you really, really loved me
Darling, you run around all over town
You build me up and then you let me down

[Hook]
(What kind of fool) Do you think I am?
Who do you think I am, now?
Do you think I am?

[Verse 3]
I won't be your second choice
I've got to be your number one
Or I ain't gonna love you at all

Do you think I am?
Darling I'm no fool, now
Do you think I am?
What kind of fool
Do you think I am?
Do you think I am, now?
Do you think I am?
