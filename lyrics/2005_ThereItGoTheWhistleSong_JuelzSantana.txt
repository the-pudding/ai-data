San-tana, aight
It's Dipset, bitch

[Chorus]
There it go, baby, don't stop now
There it go, baby, don't stop now
There it go
Damn, shorty look good and I'm thinkin' 'bout gettin' at her
Okay, time to whistle at her
Ay, girl, you make my whistle blow
There it go, bring it here, baby
There it go, bring it here, baby

[Verse 1]
Top down and I'm at it again
It's hot now and I'm at it to win (You heard me?)
Who want it with me? Nobody want it with me
Oh, I'm so fly, oh, mami, come and get me
Sit it down, back up, bring it on, back up
Move it 'til you feel somethin' hard on your back, huh
There it go, if you want it, come and get it
I ain't kiddin', I'm with it, here it go, go
So girl, let me see you get low
There it go, yeah, just like that
Move the thang like a boomerang and come right back
There it go, I don't need to ask, I proceed to grab her
Chicks love my G'd up swagger
There it go
You might also like[Chorus]
There it go
Damn, shorty look good and I'm thinkin' 'bout gettin' at her
Okay, time to whistle at her
Ay, girl, you make my whistle blow
There it go, bring it here, baby (Come on)
There it go, bring it here, baby (Come on)
Ay, girl, let me see you get low
There it go, set it down, baby
There it go, set it down, baby (Oh)
There it go, it's Dipset (Oh)
There it go, aight, aight, aight
There it go, it's Dipset (Oh)
There it go, aight, aight, ah

[Verse 2]
I got to get it, I'm so hot terrific
So not fair to the other guys that's in it
I know not my limit 'cause no sky's the limit
'Til then I'm doin' my, doin' my, doin' my thing
So baby, keep movin' your, movin' your, movin' your thing
And that'll keep you in the, you in the, you in the ring
Or maybe not
Ay, girl, you make me want to know
You do it like a pro, lil' lady
If so, bring it here, let it show, lil' lady
There it go, let's go, lil' lady
To the crib, to the telly, you know, lil' lady
Yes, girl, um, yes, we can have a cum-fest, girl
'Til the sun sets girl (Girl)
But first I gotta get you undressed, girl
So take off them clothes and get undressed, girl
[Chorus]
Damn, shorty look good and I'm thinkin' 'bout gettin' at her
Okay, time to whistle at her
Ay, girl, you make my whistle blow
There it go, bring it here, baby (Come on)
There it go, bring it here, baby (Come on)
Ay, girl, let me see you get low
There it go, set it down, baby (Go 'head)
There it go, set it down, baby5Embed
