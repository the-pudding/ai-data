2 ContributorsRocky LyricsAlone until my eighteenth year
We met four springs ago
She was shy and had a fear
Of things she did not know
But we got it on together in such a super way
We held each other close at night
And traded dreams each day

And she said
Rocky
I've never been in love before
Don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you
Take my hand
I might get through it (through it)

I said
Baby, oh sweet baby
It's love that sets us free
And God knows if the world should end
Your love is safe with me

We found an old gray house
And you would not believe the way
We worked at night to fix it up
Took classes in the day
Painting walls and sipping wine
Sleeping on the floor
With so much love for just two
Soon we found there'd be one more
You might also likeAnd she said
Rocky
I've never had a baby before
Don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you
Take my hand
I might get through it (through it)

I said
Baby, oh, sweet baby
It's love that sets us free
And God knows if the world should end
Your love is safe with me

We had lots of problems then
But we had lots of fun
Like the crazy party
When our baby girl turned one
I was proud and satisfied

Life had so much to give
'Till the day they told me
That she didn't have long to live
She said
Rocky
I've never had to die before
Don't know if I can do it
Now it's back to two again
The little girl and I
Who looks so much like her sweet mother
Sometimes it makes me cry

I sleep alone at nights again
I walk alone each day
And sometimes when I'm about to give in
I hear her sweet voice say to me

Rocky
You know you've been alone before
You know that you can do it
But if you'd like to lean on me
Take my hand
I'll help you through it (through it)

I said
Baby, oh, sweet baby
It's love that sets us free
And I told you when the world would end
Your love was safe with me

She said
Rocky
You know you've been alone before
You know that you can do it
But if you'd like to lean on me...Embed
