101 ContributorsBlack or White Lyrics[Skit: George Wendt & Macaulay Caulkin]
(Hey!) What?
(Turn it off) But dad, this is the best part!
(Turn it off) No!
(It's too late for this, turn it off)
Dad, this is the best part, come on
(No, turn it off now) No, this is theâ€”, I wanna listen to it, okay?
Right, too late? Sure, eat this

[Intro: Michael Jackson]
Aaow! (Ooh)
Aaow!

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, "I ain't second to none"
You might also like[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, hoo

[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Gone wit' ya, babe
Hee-hee

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Go when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Go when the going gets mean

[Verse 3: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from, it's where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee)
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Alright, alright (Ooh-ooh)
Alright (Yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah, now
Alright, alright (Ooh-ooh)
Shamone, don't (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, now, alright, ah
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to beat, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, (It's white)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to beat, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo!39Embed
