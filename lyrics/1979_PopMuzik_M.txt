(Pop, pop, pop muzik)

Get up, get down

[Verse 1]
Radio, video
Boogie with a suitcase
You're living in a disco
Forget about the rat race
Let's do the Milkshake
Selling like a hotcake
Try some, buy some
Fee-fi-fo-fum
Talk about pop muzik
Talk about pop muzik

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Shoobie-doobie-doo-wop)
I want to dedicate it
(Pop, pop, shoo-wop)
Everybody made it
(Shoobie-doobie-doo-wop)
Infiltrate it
(Pop, pop, shoo-wop)
Activate it

Sing it in the subway
Shuffle with a shoe shine
Mix me a Molotov

Dance in the supermart
Dig it in the fast lane
Listen to the countdown
They're playing our song again
I can't get "Jumping Jack"
I want to hold "Get Back"
Moonlight, muzak
Knick knack, paddy wack

Wrong way around (Pop, pop, pop muzik)
Upside down...3Embed
