Baby, I'm-a want you, baby, I'm-a need you
You're the only one I care enough to hurt about

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm-a crazy, but I just can't live without

[Verse 2]
Your loving and affection, giving me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through my darkest hour

[Bridge]
Lately I'm-a praying, that you'll always be a-staying
Beside me

[Chorus]
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Lately I'm-a praying, that you'll always be a-staying
Beside me

[Chorus]
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
You taught me why

[Outro]
Baby, I'm-a want you, baby, I'm-a need you
Oh, it took so long to find you, baby
Baby, I'm-a want you, baby, I'm-a need you2Embed
