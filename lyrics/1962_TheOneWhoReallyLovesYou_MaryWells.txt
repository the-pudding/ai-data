7 ContributorsThe One Who Really Loves You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some other girls are filling your head with jive
So now you're acting like you don't know that I'm alive

[Chorus]
Love, you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you

[Verse 2]
Suzie only wants you until the day
(Only wants you until the day)
That she'll again have her true love who's far, far away, yeah
(Her true love who's far away)

[Chorus]
(Wake-up) So love, you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Bridge]
Jenny only wants you
'Cause she thinks she has to have everyone
Minnie only wants you
For she think that hurting me would be fun
Oh, oh, oh
Silly Lilly
You know she doesn't really want you with a love that's true
In fact, there's no other girl in this whole wide world
Who can love you like I do
You might also like[Verse 3]
When they get tired of you then they're gonna put you down
(Put you down, put you down)
Then they ain't gonna want you hangin' around
(Hangin' around, hangin' around)

[Chorus]
(Wake up) So love, you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Outro]
I-I-I do (Yeah-yeah)
Really, really, love you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (yeah-yeah)

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(I really love you)
Yeah, I really, really love you
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)1Embed
