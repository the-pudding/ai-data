16 ContributorsDonâ€™t Know Much Lyrics[Verse 1 : Aaron Neville]
Look at this face
I know the years are showing
Look at this life
I still don't know where it's going

[Chorus: Aaron Neville]
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know

[Verse 2: Linda Ronstadt]
Look at these eyes
They never seen what matters
Look at these
Dreams so beaten and so battered

[Chorus: Aaron Neville & Linda Ronstadt]
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know

[Verse 3: Aaron Neville & Linda Ronstadt]
So many questions still left unanswered
So much I've never broken through
And when I feel you near me, sometimes I see so clearly
That only truth I'll never know is me and you

Look at this man
So blessed with inspiration
Look at this soul
Still searching for salvation

[Chorus: Aaron Neville & Linda Ronstadt]
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know

[Musical Interlude]

[Chorus: Aaron Neville & Linda Ronstadt]
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know

[Outro: Aaron Neville & Linda Ronstadt]
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all there is to knowEmbed
