Well, I tried to make it Sunday, but I got so damn depressed
That I set my sights on Monday and I got myself undressed
I ain't ready for the altar, but I do agree there's times
When a woman sure can be a friend of mine

[Verse 2]
Well, I keep on thinking about you, Sister Golden Hair surprise
And I just can't live without you, can't you see it in my eyes?
I been one poor correspondent and I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind

[Chorus]
Will you meet me in the middle
Will you meet me in the air?
Will you love me just a little
Just enough to show you care?
Well I tried to fake it
I don't mind sayin'
I just can't make it

[Verse 2]
Well, I keep on thinking about you, Sister Golden Hair surprise
And I just can't live without you, can't you see it in my eyes?
I been one poor correspondent and I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind
