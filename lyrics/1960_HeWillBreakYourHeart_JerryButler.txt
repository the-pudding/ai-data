4 ContributorsHe Will Break Your Heart LyricsHe don't love you like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's trying to tear us apart

Fare thee well
I know you're leaving
For the new love that you've found
The handsome guy that you've been dating
Whoa, I got a feeling he's gonna put you down, 'cause

He don't love you like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's trying to tear us apart

Now he uses all the great quotations
He says the things I wish I could say
Whoa, but he's had so many rehearsals
Girl, to him that's just another play
But wait

And when the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
Whoa, I'll be there to take you home
You might also like'Cause he don't love you and he never will like I love you
'Cause if he did, he wouldn't break your heart
Whoa. oh, oh, oh
He don't love you...Embed
