9 ContributorsFor All We Know Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
So much to say
And as we go from day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell

[Chorus]
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow
For all we know
(Laa-ahh-ahh-ove)

[Pre-Chorus]
Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways

[Chorus]
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so (Only time will tell and love may grow)
And love may grow
For all we know
