69 ContributorsBeautiful Girls Lyrics[Intro: J.R. Rotem]
J.R., Sean Kingston

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn, all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
See, it started at the park, used to chill after dark
Oh, when you took my heart, that's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought that love last forever (Last forever)
They say we're too young to get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care, we made it very clear
And they also said that we couldn't last together (Last together)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined, you're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind, you haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy
See Sean Kingston LiveGet tickets as low as $99You might also like[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn, all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
It was back in '99, watchin' movies all the time
Oh, when I went away for doin' my first crime
And I never thought that we was gonna see each other (See each other)
And then I came out, Mami moved me down south
Oh, I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
It came out to be that she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined, you're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind, you haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn, all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over
[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]
Now we're fussin', and now we're fighting
Please tell me why I'm feelin' slighted
And I don't know how to make it better (Make it better)
You're dating other guys, you're telling me lies
Oh, I can't believe what I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind and I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal, suicidal57Embed
