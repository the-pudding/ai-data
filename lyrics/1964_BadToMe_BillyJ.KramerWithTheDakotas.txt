5 ContributorsBad to Me Lyrics[Intro]
If you ever leave me
I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me
I'm so in love with you

[Verse 1]
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I'd lost my one and only
They'd be sad
If you're bad to me

[Verse 2]
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin'
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
They'd be sad
Don't be bad to me

[Chorus]
But I know you won't leave me 'cause you told me so
And I've no intention of lettin' you go
Just as long as you let me know
You won't be bad to me

[Verse 3]
So, the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cause they know that I've got my one and only
They'll be glad
You're not bad to me

[Chorus]
But I know you won't leave me 'cause you told me so
And I've no intention of lettin' you go
Just as long as you let me know
You won't be bad to me

[Verse 3]
So, the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cause they know that I've got my one and only
They'll be glad
You're not bad to me

[Outro]
They'll be glad
You're not bad
To me
To me
