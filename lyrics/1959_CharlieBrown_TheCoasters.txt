I smell smoke in the auditorium
Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
He's a clown, that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught
Just you wait and see
(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)
That's him on his knees
I know that's him
Yellin' 7 come 11
Down in the boys' gym

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
He's a clown, that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught
Just you wait and see
(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)

Who's always writing on the wall?
Who's always goofing in the hall?
Who's always throwing spitballs?
Guess who (who, me) yeah, you
Who walks in the classroom, cool and slow?
Who calls the English teacher Daddy-O?
