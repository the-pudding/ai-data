55 ContributorsDie Young Lyrics[Chorus]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
We're gonna die young
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
We're gonna die young
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young

[Drop]
Let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young

[Verse 1]
Young hearts, out our minds
Runnin' 'til we outta time
Wild childs, lookin' good
Livin' hard just like we should
Don't care who's watchin' when we tearin' it up
You know
That magic that we got, nobody can touch
Fo' sho'

Like it's the last night of our lives (Uh-huh)
We'll keep dancin' 'til we die

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone

[Verse 2]
Young punks takin' shots
Strippin' down to dirty socks
Music up, gettin' hot
Kiss me, gimme all you got
It's pretty obvious that you got a crush
You know
That magic in your pants, it's makin' me blush
Fo' sho'
[Pre-Chorus]
Lookin' for some trouble tonight (Yeah)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives (Uh-huh)
We'll keep dancin' 'til we die
