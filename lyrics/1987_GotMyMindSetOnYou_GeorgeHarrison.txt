I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
Got my mind set on you

[Verse 1]
But it's gonna take money
A whole lotta spending money
It's going to take plenty of money
To do it right, child
It's gonna take time
Whole lotta precious time
It's gonna take patience and time
Mmm, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right, child

[Chorus]
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you

[Verse 2]
And this time I know it's for real
The feelin' that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it
