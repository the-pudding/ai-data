10 ContributorsMy Little Secret Lyrics[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
See, baby, you're my little secret
Secret, secret
If you don't tell, I won't tell
And that's how we gotta keep it
See, baby, you're my little secret
Secret, secret
If you don't tell, I won't tell
And that's how we gotta keep it

[Verse 1: Kandi]
Did anybody see ya
Comin' to my house last night?
When I got your message in my beeper
That you wanna do everything I like
Alright, alright

[Pre-Chorus: LaTocha]
I like bein' in the same room with you and your girlfriend
The fact that she don't know (She don't know)
That really turns me on, mmm
She'll never guess in a million years
That we got this thing going on

[Chorus: Xscape, (LaTocha)]
You're my little secret (Secret, babe)
And that's how we should keep it (Nobody has to know)
It's on everybody's mind
('Bout me and you) About you and I
They think so
But they don't really know or wanna know that (They don't really, really know)
You're my little secret (Keep it on the hush, baby)
And that's how we should keep it (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
We should never let 'em know
Never let it show (Oh, no)
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go (Never)

If anybody knew that
It was you and your house that I was creepin' to all the time
I'd probably still do it, ha
'Cause I find it hard to keep you off of my mind, baby

[Pre-Chorus: LaTocha]
I like bein' in the same room with you and your girlfriend
The fact that she don't know (She don't know)
That really turns me on
She'll never guess in a million years
That we've got this thing going on

[Chorus: Xscape, (LaTocha)]
You're my little secret (Yeah)
And that's how we should keep it (Nobody has to know)
It's on everybody's mind
About you and I
They think so
But they don't really know or wanna know that (They don't really, really know)
You're my little secret (Keep it on the hush, baby)
And that's how we should keep it (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
We should never let 'em know
Never let it show (Oh, no)
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go (Never)
[Bridge: Kandi]
Everybody cheats
But you gotta know how, you gotta know when, you gotta know why
My infatuation with you is taking me on an emotional high
I'm caught all up in this love affair, baby
Speculation will bring us stares
All my friends are asking me about it
Still the truth I can't reveal

[Chorus: Xscape, (Kandi)]
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it (And that's how we should keep it, baby)
It's on everybody's mind
About you and I (Uh-huh)
They think so
But they don't really know or wanna know that (They don't really know)
You're my little secret (No, no, no)
And that's how we should keep it (That's how, that's how)
We should never let 'em know
Never let it show (Never, never, never, never)
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go

[Break: LaTocha, Xscape & Jagged Edge]
As long as I'm right here (I'm right here for you, baby)
You ain't never gonna be by yourself (No, no, no)
'Cause the love that we share, it stays on my mind
You're always gonna be a little secret of mine
As long as I'm right here (No)
You ain't never gonna be by yourself (No, you don't have to be alone)
'Cause the love that we share, stays on my mind
Always gonna be a little secret of mine (Yeah)
[Chorus: Xscape]
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
It's on everybody's mind
About you and I
They think so
But they don't really know or wanna know that
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
We should never let 'em know
Never let it show
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go2Embed
