12 ContributorsOh Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, girl
I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
I just don't know how

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be

[Bridge]
All my friends call me a fool
They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now, oh

[Verse 3]
Oh, girl
Tell me, what am I gonna do
I know I've got a guilty face
Girl, I feel so out of place, oh, yeah yeah

[Interlude]
(Du-du, du-du, du-du)
Don't know where to go, who to see, yeah
(Du-du, du-du, du-du)

Oh, girl
I guess I better go
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl, I've gotta get away from here

[Verse 5]
Oh, girl
Pain will double if you leave me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
And I don't, I don't know how

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, mmhmm
Oh, girl
Why do I love you so?
Yeah
(Du-du, du-du, du-du)
Better be on my way, I can't stay, oh yeah
(Du-du, du-du, du-du)
Have you ever seen such a helpless man, oh noEmbed
