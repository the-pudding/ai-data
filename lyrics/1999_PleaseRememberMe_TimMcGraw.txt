7 ContributorsPlease Remember Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
When all our tears have reached the sea
Part of you will live in me
Way down deep inside my heart
The days keep coming without fail
A new wind is gonna find your sail
That's where your journey starts

[Chorus]
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

[Verse 2]
Just like the waves down by the shore
We're gonna keep on coming back for more
'Cause we don't ever wanna stop
Out in this brave new world you seek
Oh, the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

[Chorus]
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Remember me when you're out walking
When the snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor
When I can't hurt you anymore

[Chorus]
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me
