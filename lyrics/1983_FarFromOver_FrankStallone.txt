5 ContributorsFar from Over LyricsThis is the end
You made your choice and now my chance is over
I thought I was in
You put me down and say I'm going nowhere

Save me darling
I am down but I am far from over
Give me something
I need it all 'cause I am running over

Back in the race
I'm moving in 'cause I am getting closer
I'm digging in
I want it more than anything I've wanted

Save me darling
I am down but I am far from over
Give me something
I need it all 'cause I am running over

Save me darling
I am down but I am far from over
Give me something
I need it all 'cause I am running over

Save me darling
I am down but I am far from over
Give me something
I need it all 'cause I am running over
