1 ContributorDiane LyricsSmile for me, my Diane

I'm in heaven when I see you smile (see you smile)
Smile for me, my Diane (my Diane)
And though everything's dark, all the while
I can see you, Diane (bom-bom-bom)

You have lighted the road leading home
Oh, pray for me, when you can (when you can)
But no matter wherever I roam
Smile for me, my Diane

I'm in heaven when I see you smile (see you smile)
Smile for me, my Diane (my Diane)
And though everything's dark, all the while
I can see you, Diane (bom-bom-bom)

You have lighted the road leading home
Oh, pray for me, when you can (when you can)
But no matter wherever I roam
Smile for me, my Diane
