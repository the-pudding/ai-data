5 ContributorsLonely Blue Boy Lyrics[Verse 1]
My name should be trouble, my name should be woe
For trouble and heartache is all that I know
Yes, a lonely, lonely blue boy is my name

[Verse 2]
My life has been empty, my heart has been torn
It must have been raining the night I was born
Yes, a lonely, lonely blue boy is my name

[Bridge]
Well, I'm so, I'm so afraid of tomorrow (Tomorrow)
And so tired, so tired of today (Tired of today)
They say that love is the answer
But love never came my way

[Verse 3]
I'm writing this letter to someone unknown
So if you should find it and if you're alone
Well, a lonely, lonely blue boy is my name

[Outro]
Remember, a lonely, lonely blue boy is my nameYou might also likeEmbed
