6 ContributorsTryinâ€™ to Live My Life Without You (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I used to smoke five packs of cigarettes a day
It was the hardest thing to put them away
I drank four or five bottles of wine
I kept a glass in my hand all the time

[Verse 2]
Breakin' those habits
Was hard to do
But nothin' compared to the changes
That you put me through

[Chorus]
Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared
It was the hardest burden I'll ever bear

[Verse 3]
I had the worst reputation in town
For chasing all the women around
I thought changin' my way of living was hard to do
But it's nothin' compared to the changes that you put me through

[Bridge]
I've done everything I tried to do
But it's gonna take a miracle to get me over you
You might also like[Chorus]
Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bearEmbed
