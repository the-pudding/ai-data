19 ContributorsSomething About You Lyrics[Verse 1: Mark King]
How, how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Lindup]
Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

[Chorus: Mark King]
That there is something about you
Baby, so right
I wouldn't be without you, baby, tonight

[Verse 2: Mark King]
If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh, and you need to hear
The time that told the truth

[Chorus: Mark King]
That there is something about you
Baby, so right
Don't want to be without you
Baby, tonight
Because there's something about you
Baby, so right
I couldn't live without you
Baby, tonight
I know there's something about you
And I couldn't live without you tonight5Embed
