37 ContributorsThatâ€™s All Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Just as I thought, it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me it's black, when I know that it's white
Always the same, it's just a shame, and that's all

[Pre-Chorus]
I could leave, but I won't go, though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

[Chorus]
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

[Verse 2]
Turning me on, turning me off
Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you's just a-putting me through it, all of the time
Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you's just a-putting me through it all of the time
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I could leave, but I won't go, but it'd be easier, I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

[Chorus]
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

[Bridge]
Truth is I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together till the end
[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
But I could leave, but I won't go, it'd be easier, I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

[Chorus]
So, why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
[Bridge]
But I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together till the end

[Verse 1]
But just as I thought it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Well, I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
That's all
