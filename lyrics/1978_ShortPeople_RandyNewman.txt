Short people got no reason
Short people got no reason
Short people got no reason to live

[Verse 1]
They got little hands, little eyes
They walk around tellin' great big lies
They got little noses, tiny little teeth
They wear platform shoes on their nasty little feet

[Chorus]
Well, I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people â€˜round here

[Bridge]
(Short people are just the same as you and I)
A fool such as I
(All men are brothers until the day they die)
It's a wonderful world

[Chorus]
Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody to love
You might also like[Verse 2]
They got little baby legs, they stand so low
You got to pick 'em up just to say hello
They got little cars that go beep, beep, beep
They got little voices goin' peep, peep, peep
They got grubby little fingers and dirty little minds
They're gonna get you every time

[Chorus]
Well, I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people 'round here3Embed
