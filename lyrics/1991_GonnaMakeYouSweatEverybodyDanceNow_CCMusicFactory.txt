47 ContributorsGonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now) Lyrics[Intro: Martha Wash]
Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!
Give me the music
Give me the music
Everybody dance now!
Give me the music
Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah
Everybody dance now!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Everybody

[Verse 1: Freedom Williams, Martha Wash]
Here is the dome, back with the bass
The jam is live in effect and I don't waste time
On the mic with a dope rhyme
Jump to the rhythm, jump, jump to the rhythm, jump
And I'm here to combine
Beats and lyrics to make your shake your pants
Take a chance, come on and dance
Guys grab a girl, don't wait, make her twirl
It's your world and I'm just a squirrel
Tryna get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so yo what's up
Hands in the air, come on, say "Yeah"
Everybody over here, everybody over there
The crowd is live and I pursue this groove
Party people in the house, move
(Make me feel right) Groove
(Work me all night)

Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you

[Verse 2: Freedom Williams, Martha Wash]
Pause, take a breath and go for yours
On my command, now hit the dance floor
It's gonna make you sweat 'til you bleed
Is that dope enough? Indeed
I paid the price to control the dice
I'm more precise, to the point I'm nice
The music takes control, your heart and soul
Unfold, your body is free and a whole
Dance 'til you can't, dance
'Til you can't dance no more
Get on the floor and get raw
Dip, come back then upside down
Easy now, let me see ya move
(Make me feel right) Groove
(Work me all night)
(The music is my life)

[Chorus: Martha Wash]
Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!
Everybody
Come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
