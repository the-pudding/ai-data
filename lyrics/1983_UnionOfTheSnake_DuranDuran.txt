13 ContributorsUnion of the Snake Lyrics[Verse 1]
Telegram force and ready
I knew this was a big mistake
There's a fine line drawing
My senses together
And I think it's about to break

[Pre-Chorus]
If I listen close, I can hear them singers, oh ho ho
Voices in your body coming through on the radio, ho ho

[Chorus]
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up, it’s gonna race, it’s gonna break
Through the borderline

[Verse 2]
Nightshades on a warning
Give me strength, at least give me a light
Give me anything, even sympathy
There's a chance you could be right

[Pre-Chorus]
If I listen close, I can hear them singers, oh ho ho
Voices in your body coming through on the radio, ho ho

The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up, it’s gonna race, it’s gonna break
Through the borderline

[Chorus]
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up, it’s gonna race, it’s gonna break
Through the borderline

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
If I listen close, I can hear them singers, oh ho ho
Voices in your body coming through on the radio, ho ho

[Chorus]
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up, it’s gonna race, it’s gonna break
Through the borderline

The Union of the Snake is on the climb
It’s gonna race, it’s gonna break
Gonna move up to the borderline

The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up, it’s gonna race, it’s gonna break
Through the borderline
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
It’s gonna race, it’s gonna break, it’s gonna move up
To the borderlineEmbed
