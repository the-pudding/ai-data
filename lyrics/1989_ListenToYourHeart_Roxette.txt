I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of Heaven turns too dark

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away, and nothing is what is seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

[Bridge]
And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart before, uhh
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart (Uhh, take a listen to it, ha-ha-aa)
Listen to your heart (Take a, take a listen to it)
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
