What's new pussycat? Woah, Woah

Pussycat, Pussycat
I've got flowers
And lots of hours
To spend with you
So go and powder your cute little pussycat nose!
Pussycat, Pussycat
I love you
Yes, I do!
You and your pussycat nose!

What's new pussycat? Woah, Woah
What's new pussycat? Woah, Woah
Pussycat, Pussycat
You're so thrilling
And I'm so willing
To care for you
So go and make up your big little pussycat eyes!
Pussycat, Pussycat
I love you
Yes, I do!
You and your pussycat eyes!

What's new pussycat? Woah, Woah
What's new pussycat? Woah, Woah
What’s new pussycat? Woah, Woah
Pussycat, Pussycat
You're delicious
And if my wishes
Could all come true
I'll soon be kissing your sweet little pussycat lips!
Pussycat, Pussycat
I love you
Yes, I do!
You and your pussycat lips!
You and your pussycat eyes!
You and your pussycat nose!See Tom Jones LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like3Embed
