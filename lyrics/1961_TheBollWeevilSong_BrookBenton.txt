5 ContributorsThe Boll Weevil Song LyricsLet me tell ya a story about a boll weevil
Now, some of you may not know, but a boll weevil is an insect
And he's found mostly where cotton grows
Now, where he comes from, hmm, nobody really knows
But this is the way the story goes

The farmer said to the boll weevil
"I see you're on the square"
Boll weevil said to the farmer "Say yep!
My whole darn family's here"

We gotta have a home
Gotta have a home

The farmer said to the boll weevil
"Say, why'd you pick my farm?"
The weevil just laughed at the farmer and said
Said, "We ain't gonna do ya much harm"

"We're looking for a home"

And the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug
He said "Hey, I'd like to make a trade with you
But you see, if I was a lightning bug
I'd search the whole night through"
You might also likeJust searchin' for a home
I'd have me plenty of homes

And the boll weevil called the farmer and he said
"You better sell your old machines
'Cause when I'm through with your cotton, heh
You can't even buy gasoline."

I'm gonna stake me a home
Gotta have a home

And the boll weevil said to the farmer
Said, "Farmer, I'd like to wish you well."
Farmer said to the boll weevil
"Yeah, an' I wish that you were in..."

Lookin' for a home
Lookin' for a home
Ahh, you have a home, all right
You'll have a home
A real hot homeEmbed
