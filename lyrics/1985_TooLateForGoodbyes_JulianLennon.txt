16 ContributorsToo Late for Goodbyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ever since you've been leaving me
I've been wanting to cry
Now, I know how it feels for you
I've been wanting to die

[Chorus]
But, it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes! It's much too late for goodbyes

[Verse 2]
Time has gone since I've been with you
And we've been starting to lie
Now, it seems you don't care for me
And I don't understand why

[Chorus]
But, it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes! It's much too late for goodbyes

[Verse 3]
Ever since you've been far away
I've been wanting to fly
Now, I know what you meant to me
I'm the one who should cry

[Chorus]
And it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes! It's much too late for goodbyes

[Verse 4]
Ever since you've been leaving me
I've been wanting to cry
Now, I know how it feels for you
I've been wanting to die

[Chorus]
And it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes! It's much too late for goodbyes

[Outro]
Ooh, ah!
Dit, dit, dit, dit doo
Ba da ba da ba da ba, ba
Ba ba ba ba ba2Embed
