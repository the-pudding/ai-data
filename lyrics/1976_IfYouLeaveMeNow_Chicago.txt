30 ContributorsIf You Leave Me Now Lyrics[Verse 1: Peter Cetera]
If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh, no, baby, please don't go

[Verse 2: Peter Cetera]
And if you leave me now
You'll take away the very heart of me
Ooh, no, baby, please don't go
Ooh, girl, I just want you to stay

[Chorus: Peter Cetera]
A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away?
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Peter Cetera]
A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away?
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

Ooh, no, baby, please don't go
