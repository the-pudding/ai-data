7 ContributorsBaby (Youâ€™ve Got What It Takes) Lyrics[Verse 1: Brook Benton & Dinah Washington]
Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby, you've got what it takes (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Dinah Washington & Brook Benton]
You know it takes a lot of kissin' (Tell me about it)
To make a romance sweet (Uh-huh)
Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
Mmm, and it takes a lot of woman to knock me off my feet
And baby, you've got what it takes

[Bridge: Dinah Washington & Brook Benton, Brook Benton]
I said, mmm, mmm, mmm
Uh-huh, mmm
You know you've got just what it takes

[Verse 3: Brook Benton & Dinah Washington]
Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
It'd take more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do." (Oh yeah)
And baby, you've got what it takes

[Bridge: Dinah Washington & Brook Benton, Brook Benton]
Uh-huh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm
You know you've got just what it takes
You might also like[Verse 4: Brook Benton, Dinah Washington, Both]
Because it takes, yeah, oh yeah
You're in my spot again, honey (I like your spot)
To stay away from you (I can't stay away from you)
It takes more than a lifetime, daddy, to prove that I'll be true
Now it's you
But it takes somebody special (Like me, baby)
To make me say, "I do."
And baby, you've got what it takes

[Outro: Brook Benton, Dinah Washington, Both]
Come on, say it again, honey
Come on, say it one more time, alright
And baby, you've got what it takes
One more time, Brook
Ah-ha, alright, okay, ah-ha
And baby, you've got what it takesEmbed
