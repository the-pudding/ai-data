[Verse 1]
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
We're so sorry if we caused you any pain
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But there's no one left at home
And I believe I'm gonna rain

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
We're so sorry, but we haven't heard a thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But if anything should happen
We'll be sure to give a ring

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But we haven't done a bloody thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But the kettle's on the boil
And we're so easily called away

[Chorus]
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky

[Verse 1]
Admiral Halsey notified me
He had to have a berth or he couldn't get to sea
I had another look and I had a cup of tea
And a butter pie (A butter pie?)
(The butter wouldn't melt, so I put it in the pie, alright?)

[Chorus]
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky

[Bridge]
Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around
Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around
[Flugelhorn Solo]

[Chorus]
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky5Embed
