Well, I'm hot blooded
Check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

[Verse 1]
You don't have to read my mind
To know what I have in mind
Honey you oughta know

[Verse 2]
Now you move so fine
Let me lay it on the line
I wanna know
What you're doin' after the show?

[Bridge 1]
Now it's up to you
We can make a secret rendezvous?
Just me and you
I'll show you loving like you never knew

[Chorus]
That's why I'm hot blooded
Check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, hot blooded

If it feels alright
Maybe you can stay all night
Shall I leave you my key?

[Verse 4]
But you've got to give me a sign
Come on girl, some kind of sign
Tell me, are you hot mama?
You sure look that way to me

[Bridge 2]
Are you old enough?
Will you be ready when I call you bluff?
Is my timing right?
Did you save your love for me tonight?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm hot blooded
Check it and see
I feel a fever burnin' inside of me
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded
I'm hot!

[Bridge 3]
Now it's up to you
Can we make a secret rendezvous?
Oh, before we do
You'll have to get away from you know who
[Chorus]
Well, I'm hot blooded
Check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

[Outro]
Hot blooded, every night
Hot blooded, you're lookin' so tight
Hot blooded, now you're driving me wild
Hot blooded, I'm so hot for you, child
Hot blooded, I'm a little bit high
Hot blooded, you're a little bit shy
Hot blooded, you're makin' me sing
Hot blooded, for you sweet, sweet thing
Did you hear what I said?4Embed
