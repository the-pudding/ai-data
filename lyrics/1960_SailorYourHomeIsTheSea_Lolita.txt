1 ContributorSailor (Your Home is the Sea) LyricsUeber Rio und Shanghai
Ueber Bali und Hawaii
Deine liebe ist dein schiff
Sailor! Sailor!
Your home is the deep blue sea!
[?]
And the stars are your best friends!
And though you find your thrills
In the places far away from me
Just remember
I'm always waiting
When your journey endsYou might also likeEmbed
