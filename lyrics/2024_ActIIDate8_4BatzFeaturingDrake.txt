You want me to pull up?

[Chorus: 4batz]
I'll come and slide by 8 p.m.
And send a text to your DM
Five hunnid for your fuckin’ hair
Two hunnid for your fuckin' nails
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair

[Verse 1: 4batz]
Girl, I got you another dress
So bring yo’ ass up-down them stairs
I buy you shit because you rare
And, plus, because you know I care
Bitch, you know you love it here
That's why you keep on comin' near
Your nigga can't compete, I swear (Nah, for real)
He tried, but now he look too weak, baby

[Chorus: 4batz]
I'll come and slide by 8 p.m.
And send a text to your DM
Five hunnid for your fuckin' hair
Two hunnid for your fuckin' nails
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair
You runnin’ out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair
You might also like[Break: 4batz]
I’ll come and slide by 8 p.m.

[Verse 2: Drake]
What did I do to deserve you?
Don't even know what I did
Been prayin’ on it since a kid
I guess it's just luck if you say so
How you get all of that body and face, though?
What kinda water they servin' in Clayco?
This is me talkin', it’s not the añejo
Ready to pop out, but we gotta lay low
I really gotta calm down
'Fore I end up in jeopardy just like the game show
Broski my twin, that's my bestie
He love me, said I got the blessin'
I swear he's gassin' me up
There's no way in hell I see you passin' me up
Almost said I loved your ass right after we fucked
Don't know why, girl, it was on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, found someone I'm fallin' for
You hit me back, we're talkin' more now
The bodies that you caught before (They don't)
Make me mad or insecure (I'm good)
A thousand on your fuckin' hair
Two hunnid on your fuckin' nails, for real
This shit feel like a fairy tale (I swear)
I'll make them open up Chanel, ch-ch
I'm a stand-up guy like Dave Chappelle
I was cursed, you 'bout to break the spell, for real
Tell that nigga that you done with him
Girl, who cares if he gon' take it well? You're done
[Outro: 4batz]
(Five hunnid for your fuckin' hair)
(Two hunnid for your fuckin' nails)2Embed
