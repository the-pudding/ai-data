16 ContributorsBreakinâ€™ My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes) Lyrics[Intro]
Pretty brown eyes

[Verse 1]
Pretty brown eyes
You know I see you
It's a disguise the way you treat me (The way you treat me, pretty brown eyes)
You keep holding on
To your thoughts of rejection
If you're with me, you're secured
You keep telling me
That your time is always taken
But I keep seeing you out alone (Out alone, pretty brown eyes)
Listen to love
Your heart is pounding with desire
Waiting to be unleashed

[Chorus]
Quit breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart (Pretty brown eyes)
Breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart (Pretty brown eyes)
Sugar, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't tell your friends
That I don't mean nothing to you
Please don't deny the truth (Pretty brown eyes)
Tell me right now
I know your heart is in the right place
You know I won't let you down, yeah, yeah
You can't disguise
All the pounding of your heart, yeah
(I see your eyes)
I see your eyes (Pretty brown eyes) and you can't hide
Start to make sense
And quit playin' these love games
Tell me what you're gonna do, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Quit breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart (Pretty brown eyes)
Breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart (Pretty brown eyes)

[Saxophone solo]
(Pretty brown eyes)
(Pretty brown eyes)

[Break]
I just wanna know one thing
Will you be with me? (Pretty brown eyes)

[Bridge]
Here comes my darling
Here comes romance
Here comes my love
And please, honey, will you dance?

[Chorus]
Quit breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart (Pretty brown eyes)
Breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart (Pretty brown eyes)
[Outro]
Here comes my love
Here comes romance
Here comes my darling
Here comes romance
Oh yeah
(Pretty brown eyes)
Breakin' my heart (Pretty brown eyes)
Breakin' my heart (Pretty brown eyes)19Embed
