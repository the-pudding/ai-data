It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say, "Woe is me" instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me, "You're better off alone"

[Pre-Chorus]
But after midnight
Morning will come
And the day will see
If you will get some

[Chorus]
They say, "That girl, ya know, she act too tough, tough, tough
Well, it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say, "That girl, you know, she act so rough, rough, rough
Well, it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say, "Follow me, follow me, follow me down
Down, down, down
'Til you see all my dreams"
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

[Verse 2]
I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon (By the moon)
If it's high, play it low
If it's harvest, go slow
And if it's full, then go

But after midnight
Morning will come
And the day will see
If you're gonna get some

[Chorus]
They say, "That girl, ya know, she act too tough, tough, tough
Well, it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say, "That girl, you know, she act so rough, rough, rough
Well, it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say, "Follow me, follow me, follow me down
Down, down, down
'Til you see all my dreams"
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

[Bridge]
And I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you, don't you, don't you come and be with me?
I pretend to be cool with me, wanna believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me, life
Where is the love that I'm looking to find?
It's all in me, can't you see? Why can't you, why can't you see?
It's all in me
[Chorus]
All in me, yeah, where is your logic?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
And I said follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
Do you see all my dreams? (Yeah)
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
Follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Follow me down, follow me
Down, down, down
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
And I said follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
(Do you see all my dreams?)
See all my dreams
Follow me follow me follow me
Down down down down
See all my dreams
See all my dreams

[Outro]
All in me yeah, where is your logic?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Where can you turn?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?5Embed
