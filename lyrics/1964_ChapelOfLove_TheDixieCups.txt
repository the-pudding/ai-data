Goin' to the chapel
And we're gonna get married
Goin' to the chapel
And we're gonna get married
Gee, I really love you
And we're gonna get married
Goin' to the chapel of love

[Verse 1]
Spring is here, the sky is blue, whoa
Birds all sing as if they knew
Today's the day we'll say "I do"
And we'll never be lonely anymore

[Chorus]
Because we're goin' to the chapel
And we're gonna get married
Goin' to the chapel
And we're gonna get married
Gee, I really love you
And we're gonna get married
Goin' to the chapel of love

[Verse 2]
Bells will ring, the sun will shine, whoa
I'll be his and he'll be mine
We'll love until the end of time
And we'll never be lonely anymore
