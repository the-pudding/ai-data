20 ContributorsSeparate Lives (Love Theme from ”White Nights”) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

[Chorus]
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me, so kind
I can't go on just holding on to ties
Now that we're living separate lives

[Verse 2]
Well, I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

[Bridge]
Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
And you make it stronger
You might also like[Chorus]
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me, so kind
I can't go on just holding on to ties
Now that we're living separate lives2Embed
