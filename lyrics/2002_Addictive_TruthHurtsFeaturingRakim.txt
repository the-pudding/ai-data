23 ContributorsAddictive Lyrics[Intro: Lata Mangeshkar]
Kaliyon ka chaman tab banta hai
Thoda resham lagta hai
Thoda sheesha lagta hai
Heere moti jadte hain
Thoda sona lagta hai
Thoda resham lagta hai
Thoda sheesha lagta hai
Heere moti jadte hain
Thoda sona lagta hai

[Verse 1: Truth Hurts]
He breaks, me down, he builds, me up
He fills, my cup, I like, it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes, in late, but it's, o.k
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

[Chorus: Truth Hurts, (Lata Mangeshkar)]
(Thoda resham lagta hai)
He's so contagious
(thoda sheesha lagta hai)
He turns my pages
(Heere moti jadte hain)
He's got me anxious
(thoda sona lagta hai)
He's what I waited for
(Thoda resham lagta hai)
He keeps me guessin
(thoda sheesha lagta hai)
Spontaneous
(Heere moti jadte hain)
He's so persuasive
(thoda sona lagta hai)
And I'm his lady

Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

[Chorus: Truth Hurts, (Lata Mangeshkar)]
(Thoda resham lagta hai)
He's so contagious

He turns my pages

He's what I waited for

He keeps me guessin
(thoda sheesha lagta hai)
Spontaneous
(Heere moti jadte hain)
He's so persuasive
(thoda sona lagta hai)
And I'm his lady
[Verse 3: Rakim]
Thinking of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted
You OG'd and you OD: addicted
