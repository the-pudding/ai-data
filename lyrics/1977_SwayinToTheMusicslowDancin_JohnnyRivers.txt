4 ContributorsSwayin’ to the Music (Slow Dancin’) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's late at night and we're all alone
Just the music on the radio
No one's comin', no one's gonna telephone
Just me and you and the lights down low

[Chorus]
And we're slow dancin', swayin' to the music
Slow dancin', just me and my girl
Slow dancin', swayin' to the music
No one else in the whole wide world, just you, girl

[Verse 2]
And we just flow together when the lights are low
Shadows dancin' all across the wall
Music's playin' so soft and slow
Rest of the world so far away and small

[Chorus]
When we're slow dancin', swayin' to the music
Slow dancin', just me and my girl
Slow dancin', swayin' to the music
No one else in the whole wide world

[Bridge]
Hold me, oh-oh-oh, hold me
No, never let me go
You might also like[Verse 3]
As we dance together in the dark
So much love in this heart of mine
You whisper to me, hold you tight
You're the one I thought I'd never find

[Chorus]
Now we're slow dancin', swayin' to the music
Slow dancin', just me and my girl
Slow dancin', swayin' to the music
No one else in the whole wide world
Slow dancin', swayin' to the music
Slow dancin', just me and my, my, my, my girl
Slow dancin', swayin' to the music
No one else in the whole wide world
Whole wide world1Embed
