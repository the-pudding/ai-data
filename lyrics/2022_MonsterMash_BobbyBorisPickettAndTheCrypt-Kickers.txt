[Verse 1]
I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

[Chorus]
(He did the mash) He did the monster mash
(The monster mash) It was a graveyard smash
(He did the mash) It caught on in a flash
(He did the mash) He did the monster mash

[Verse 2]
(Wa-ooh) From my laboratory in the castle east
(Wa-ooh) To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
(Wah-wa-ooh) The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
(Wa-ooh) To get a jolt from my electrodes

[Chorus]
(They did the mash) They did the monster mash
(The monster mash) It was a graveyard smash
(They did the mash) It caught on in a flash
(They did the mash) They did the monster mash

(Wa-ooh) The zombies were having fun (An-a-shoop)
(Ah-ooh) The party had just begun (An-a-shoop)
(Ah-ooh) The guests included Wolfman (An-a-shoop)
(Ah-ooh) Dracula, and his son

[Verse 3]
(Wa-ooh) The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
(Wa-ooh) Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
(Wah-wa-ooh) The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
(Wa-ooh) With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'

[Chorus]
(They played the mash) They played the monster mash
(The monster mash) It was a graveyard smash
(They played the mash) It caught on in a flash
(They played the mash) They played the monster mash

[Verse 4]
(Wa-ooh) Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
(Wa-ooh) Seems he was troubled by just one thing
(Wah-wa-ooh) He opened the lid and shook his fist, and said
(Wa-ooh) "Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?"

[Chorus]
(It's now the mash) It's now the monster mash
(The monster mash) And it's a graveyard smash
(It's now the mash) It's caught on in a flash
(It's now the mash) It's now the monster mash
[Verse 5]
(Wa-ooh) Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
(Wa-ooh) My monster mash is the hit of the land
(Wah-wa-ooh) For you, the living, this mash was meant too
(Wa-ooh) When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

[Chorus]
(Then you can mash) Then you can monster mash
(The monster mash) And do my graveyard smash
(Then you can mash) You'll catch on in a flash
(Then you can mash) Then you can monster mash

[Outro (with Pickett providing Igor vocals)]
(Wa-ooh) Ugh, mash good! (monster mash!)
(Wa-ooh) Easy, Igor, you impetuous young boy (monster mash!)
(Wa-ooh) Argh, mash good! Grrr! (monster mash!)
(Wa-ooh, monster mash!)

(Wa-ooh, monster mash!)
(Wa-ooh, monster mash!)
(Wa-ooh, monster mash!)
(Wa-ooh, monster mash!)5Embed
