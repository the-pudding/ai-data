Too legit, too legit to quit
Too legit, too legit to quit
Too legit, too legit to quit

[Verse 1]
Sweat runnin' all over my chest (Chest)
I don't quit, no, I just press
Harder (Yeah) than I ever did before
Going for the dreams that I have in store
In my mind (Mind), and I know that I'm makin' it
I gotta get mine and nobody's takin' it away (Nah)
'Cause Hammer don't play that
You try to get mine, boy, you better step back
Freeze (Freeze), 'cause you don't want none
I hustle for my muscle and you look weak, son (Real weak)
Yeah, I'm goin' for all that I can get
Kickin' it at the top 'cause I'm too legit to quit, sing

[Chorus]
Too legit, too legit to quit (Hey, hey)
Too legit, too legit to quit (Hey, hey)
Too legit, too legit to quit (Too legit)

When I feel high post, don't you play me close
I dig 'em, smack, I'll get you back, and I'll hit with a dose
Of Oaktown power and charge you by the hour
I'm shakin' like a quake and punks get devoured
I choose to abuse, misuse and confuse
Competitors who think that they're makin' up all the rules
Fools in the game, lame and insane
It's a shame I gotta do this, but I remain the same
Unchanged, gettin' better never known as a sweater
Kickin' it at the top because I got myself together
So roll with a guy who's physical and fit
Knows the time, and too legit to quit, sing

Trained for the mission, so believe the hype
And sweat it (Sweat it), 'cause you're gonna regret it
The day that you dissed us, you'll wish you never met us
