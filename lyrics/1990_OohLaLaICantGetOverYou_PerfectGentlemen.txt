1 ContributorOoh La La (I Canâ€™t Get Over You) LyricsOoh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

I remember the day
It was oh so sad
She was the sweetest dearest friend I ever had
She could talk to me almost anytime
And at the end of my day
I felt fine

Her mother broke the news to my heart
She said theyre leaving
And now I'm torn all apart
I think I'll never forget that day
And for you, girl
This is all I have to say

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

I had a dream
Me, myself and I
You were my girl
And of course I was your guy
We were together forever in love for life
And now it don't seem so very nice
You might also likeForever to me was short but sweet
You never let me down
You kept me on my feet
Now today all I have to say
Take it out, girl
And try to find a way

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

Believe it or not
I can't get over you
You are my everything
What a dream come true
What I feel for you is really hard to explain
I'm in love, girl
I'll never feel the same

You and me can save our love
We'll be together one day
Like hand in glove
All I have to say is
I'll wait forever and a day
Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

Wait a minute, fellas
This has gotta be a dream
You know
I'm so used to seeing her every single day

My life will never be the same
I know it seems like we just met
And now shes leaving
I'll never find another girl like her

You think if we keep singing this song
She'll hear it on the radio and come back?
Hey guys, I definitely think it's worth a try

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over youEmbed
