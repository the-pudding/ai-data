23 ContributorsQueen of Hearts Lyrics[Verse 1]
Midnight, and I'm a-waiting on the twelve-oh-five
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line
Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breaking, if it's only for a very short time?

[Chorus]
Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie, thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you

[Verse 2]
Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done?
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches, you know you got to have you some

[Chorus]
Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie, thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you

You might also like[Verse 3]
Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers and tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm goin' through
And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun

[Chorus]
Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you

[Chorus]
Playing with the queen of hearts, and knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you
I'm laying out another lie, I'm thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you

[Outro]
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of heartsEmbed
