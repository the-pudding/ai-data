29 ContributorsWhat You Want Lyrics[Intro: Total]
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Just tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want

[Chorus: Total]
Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years
Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Now Ma$e be the man wanna see you doing good
I don't wanna get rich, leave you in the hood
Girl, in my eyes you the baddest
The reason why I love you, you don't like me 'cause my status
I don't wanna see you with a carriage, living average
I wanna do my thing so we be established
And I don't want you rockin' them fabrics
Girl, I wanna give you carats 'til you feel you a rabbit
Anything in your path you want, you can have
Walk through the mall; if you like it, you can grab
Total it all up and put it on my tab
And then tell your friends all the fun you had
You might also like[Chorus: Total]
Tell me what you want for me (Oh yeah)
Take a look at what you see (Tell me what you want)
Let me know if this right here (Right here)
Is something you can have for years (Have for years)
Tell me what you want for me (Tell me what you want)
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Hey, mama, won't you come here to papa?
You don't like the way your tatas lookin' at Shada?
In a six-hunnid, ain't no smokin' cigada
Come over here, I think I see your baby father
Here ya go, the number to my casa
If you in a rush, you call me mañana
Whatever you need, girlfriend, I got the whole enchilada
Just the way you like it, Ma$e gon' do you propa
Girl, I can tell you was meant for me
I can tell by the way you was sent to me
While I'm on tour trying to make them centuries
And they ask who your man, you better mention me
If you don't, you know you got a problem
Said you want no beef; girlfriend, don't start none
And it just so happen that I'm seeing cash
'Cause you messed up a lot just trying to be fast
And I ain't gonna ask who smashed the E-Class
Pull up to the crib with the whole front crashed
Now you wanna laugh, good thing that's the past
If you ever lie again, girl, that'll be your last
[Chorus: Total]
Tell me what you want for me (Tell me what you want)
Take a look at what you see (Take a look at me)
Let me know if this right here (Ooh)
Is something you can have for years (I'll let you know)
Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see (Is all you can have)
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years (Ayy, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Ma$e & Total]
Now the more you treat me royal, I adore you (Oh yeah)
That's why I don't mind doing these things for you (Oh yeah)
You did things for me I wouldn't believe you did
That's why I always want to keep you here (With you, hey)
In a year or two, girl, I could see you with my kids
Girl, you make a thug want to get a legal gig
It's only right we spend our lonely nights  (Love, alone with me and you)
Gettin' crazy biz 'til we awake the kids
Don't get too loud, got respect for you honey
To keep it all real, you come second to my money
And can you be my ghetto love prophecy? (Yeah)
Everybody love you, girl, not just me  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I know that you really care a lot for me
Wanna see you happy even if it's not with me (Not with me) (Yeah, yeah, uh)
So even if you're not with me (So what you want?)
[Chorus: Total]
Tell me what you want for me (Mm)
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here (I said)
Is something you can have for years (Something you can have)
Tell me what you want for me (For me)
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here (Oh)
Is something you can have for years (For years)
Tell me what you want for me (Me)
Take a look at what you see (Yeah)
Let me know if this right here (Is this what you want, hey)
Is something you can have for years
Tell me what you want for me (Tell me what you want)
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here (You got me)
Is something you can have for years (And you, for you)
For years
Tell me what you want for me (What you want)
Take a look at what you see (Mm)
