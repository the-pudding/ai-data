Now you want my love, well, that's alright
Well, it will be there for you, morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good, and do me right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well, you wanna be loved, huh, hey, that's okay
'Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down, a nickel gotta be true
Cause otherwise this B ain't got no time for you

[Chorus: T-Boz]
Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
'Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

[Refrain: T-Boz]
Well, you want my heart, huh, and all my time
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
'Cause a girl like me, huh, won't stand for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

[Verse 2: Chilli]
Long as you know that I could have any man I want to, baby
That's actual and factual, but still, I choose you
To be with me, and work on me, so you better not flake it up
Ohhh

I can have any man that I want to
Time or place that I choose to
But I think you know that I would rather be here with you, yeah
That's actual and factual
You're the one I seem to run back to just to get me off
You got to love me, got to love me, got to love me

Baby, baby, baby (Oh baby)
I got so much love in me (So much love, so much love)
Oh baby, baby

You got to love me deep (Got to love me, got to love me, love me deep)
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
I got so much love in me (So much love in me)
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby (Oh yeah)
'Cause if you're gonna get me off ('Cause if you're gonna get me, get me, you got to)
You got to love me deep (Love me deep)
I said baby, baby, baby
I could have any man that I want to
Time or place that I choose to
But I think you know that I would rather be here with you, yeah
That's actual and factual
You're the one I seem to run back to, just to get me off13Embed
