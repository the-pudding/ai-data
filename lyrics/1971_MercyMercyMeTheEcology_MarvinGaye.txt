Woah-oh, oh mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the North and South and East

[Verse 2]
(Father) Woah-oh, mercy, mercy me (Ah, mercy)
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no, no (Have mercy, Father)
Oil wasted on the oceans and upon our seas (Have mercy, please have mercy, Father)
Fish full of mercury (Please have mercy, Father)

[Verse 3]
Oh, oh, oh mercy, mercy me (Help us, Father, have mercy, please help us, Father)
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no, no (Have mercy, you oughta help us, Father)
Radiation underground and in the sky (Please have mercy, ah, help us, Father)
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying (Oh, please help us, Father, Father, help us, Father)

[Verse 4]
Oh, mercy, mercy me (Have mercy, mmm, mercy, Father)
Oh, things ain't what they used to be (Please have mercy, ah, mercy, Father)
What about this overcrowded land? (Have mercy, Father, oh, have mercy, Father)
How much more abuse from man can she stand? (Please have mercy, mmm)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, oh no, no, na, na, na, na
My sweet Lord, na, na, na
My, my Lord, my sweet Lord
