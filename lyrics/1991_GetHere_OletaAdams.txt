17 ContributorsGet Here Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can reach me by railway
You can reach me by trailway
You can reach me on an airplane
You can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man

[Chorus]
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can

[Verse 2]
You can reach me by sailboat
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide downslope
Into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt
Cross the border in a blaze of hope

[Chorus]
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can

[Refrain]
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, surely you would be closer
I need you closer

[Refrain]
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, surely you would be closer
I need you closer

[Verse 3]
You can windsurf into my life
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon
But you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man

[Chorus]
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can

[Outro]
I don't care, I don't care
I need you right here, right now
I need you right here, right now
Right by my side, yeah ,yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can1Embed
