All my friends know the low rider
(Yeah)
The low rider is a little higher
(Yeah)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
The low rider drives a little slower
Low rider, is a real goer

[Interlude]
Hey

[Verse 3]
Low rider knows every street, yeah
Low rider, is the one to meet, yeah

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Low rider don't use no gas now
The low rider don't drive too fast

[Instrumental Interlude]
