I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You're like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm 'bout to explode

[Refrain]
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running 'cause you're taking me there
Don't you know?
You spin me out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Boom me like a bass drum
Sparking up a rhythm
Baby, come on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

My heart beats out of time
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
You strum me like a guitar

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running 'cause you're taking me there
Don't you know?
You spin me out of control

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
