6 ContributorsBilly, Donâ€™t Be a Hero Lyrics[Verse 1:]
The marching band came down along Main Street
The soldier blues fell in behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line

And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was crying
And through her tears I heard her say

[Chorus:]
Billy, don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero
Come back and make me your wife

And as he started to go
She said, "Billy, keep your head low."
Billy, don't be hero
Come back to me

[Verse 2:]
The soldier blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried, "We've got to hang on, boys!
We've got to hold this piece of ground."
You might also likeI need a volunteer to ride up
And bring us back some extra men."
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgetting all the words she said

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I heard his fiancee got a letter
That told how Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She should be proud
He died that way
I heard she threw the letter awayEmbed
