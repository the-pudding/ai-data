The Ray Charles Singers
M. Vaughan
(Aaaah, Aaaah)
Love me with all of your heart, that's all I want dear
Love me with all of your heart or not at all
Just promise me this: that you'll give me all your kisses every
Winter, every summer, every fall
When we are far apart or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart as I love you
Don't give me your love for a moment or an hour
Love me always as you loved me from the start:
With every beat of your heart
(Aaaah, Aaaah)
When we are far apart or when you're near me
Love me with all your heart as I love you
Don't give me your love for a moment or an hour
Love me always as you loved me from the start:
With every beat of your heart
With every beat of your heart
With every beat of your heaaarrrt
