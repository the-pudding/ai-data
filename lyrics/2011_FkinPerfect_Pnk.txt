8 ContributorsF**kin’ Perfect (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss "Knowing it's all good” it didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look, I'm still around

[Chorus]
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me

[Verse 2]
You're so mean (You're so mean) when you talk (When you talk)
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices (Change the voice) in your head (In your head)
Make them like you instead

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So complicated, look how we all make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh-oh

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me

[Bridge]
The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, and it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that? Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?
Yeah, oh, oh
Pretty, pretty, pretty
Yeah-eh

[Chorus]
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me
Yeah, you're perfect, you're perfect to me
Pretty, pretty please, oh, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me4Embed
