11 ContributorsHigh on You Lyrics[Verse 1]
There you stood, that'll teach her
To look so good and feel so right
Let me tell you about the girl I met last night
It's understood, I had to reach her
I let the wheel of fortune spin
I touched your hand before the crowd started crashin' in

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I'm higher than a kite
I know I'm getting hooked on your love
Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat
Beggin' for your touch in the middle of the street, and now

[Chorus 1]
I can't stop thinkin' about you, girl
I must be livin' in a fantasy world
I'm so high on you

[Verse 2]
Smart and coy, a little crazy
The kind of face that starts a fight
Let me tell you about the girl I had last night
Piercing eyes like a raven
You seemed to share my secret sin
We were high before the night started kickin' in
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now I'm screamin' in the night
I know I'm getting hooked on your love
Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat
Beggin' for your touch in the middle of the street, and now

[Chorus 2]
I can't stop thinkin' about you, girl
I must be livin' in a fantasy world
I've searched the whole world over
To find a heart so true
Such complete intoxication
I'm high on you

[Refrain]
There you stood, that'll teach her
To look so good and feel so right
Let me tell you about the girl I met last night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I'm higher than a kite
I know I'm getting hooked on your love
Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat
Beggin' for your touch in the middle of the street, and now

[Chorus 2]
I can't stop thinkin' about you, girl
I must be livin' in a fantasy world
I've searched the whole world over
To find a heart so true
Such complete intoxication
I'm high on you
[Outro]
I'm high on you
I'm high on youEmbed
