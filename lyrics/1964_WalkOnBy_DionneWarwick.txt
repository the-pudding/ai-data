If you see me walkin' down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by
Walk on by

[Pre-Chorus]
Make believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry

[Chorus]
Walk on by (Don't stop)
Walk on by (Don't stop)
Walk on by

[Verse 2]
I just can't get over losin' you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by
Walk on by

[Pre-Chorus]
Foolish pride, that's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye

Walk on by (Don't stop)

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Walk on by, walk on by

[Pre-Chorus]
Foolish pride, that's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye

[Chorus]
Walk on by (Don't stop)
Walk on by (Don't stop)

[Outro]
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (Don't, don't stop)
Baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry (Don't, don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (Don't, don't stop)
Baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry (Don't, don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (Don't, don't stop)
Baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry (Don't, don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (Don't, don't stop)3Embed
