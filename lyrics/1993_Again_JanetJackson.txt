14 ContributorsAgain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my
Mind

[Chorus]
"How can I be strong?" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

[Verse 2]
A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions, you had many
I know you did
I've come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

[Pre-Chorus]
Making love to you
Ooh, it felt so good and
Ooh, so right

"How can I be strong?" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

[Verse 3]
So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
I don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

[Bridge]
Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love me then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

[Outro]
Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you
