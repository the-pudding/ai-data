28 ContributorsRight Here Waiting Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oceans apart, day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever?

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

[Verse 2]
I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

[Bridge]
I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me going crazy

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you9Embed
