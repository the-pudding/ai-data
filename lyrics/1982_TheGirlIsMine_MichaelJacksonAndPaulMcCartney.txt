[Intro]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
I'm Richard Cheese
You know, so many years ago Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney recorded a wonderful duet and I'd like to do it for you with someone very special
[Cheese]
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Ladies and gentlemen
Mr. Stephen Hawking!
[Hawking]
I don´t understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
[Duet]
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
But I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
The girl is mine
[Hawking]
Richard, we´re not going to fight about this, OK?
[Cheese]
Stephen, I think I told you, I´m a lover not a fighter
[Hawking]
I´ve heard it all before, Richard
She told me that I´m her forever lover, you know, don´t you remember?
[Cheese]
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn´t love another
[Hawking]
Is that what she said?
[Cheese]
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming!
[Hawking]
I don´t believe it
[Both]
Mine, mine
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)
[Hawking]
Thank you, Richard
[Cheese]
Thank you, Stephen
[Hawking]
Good night
