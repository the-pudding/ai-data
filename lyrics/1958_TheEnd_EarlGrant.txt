At the end of a rainbow
You'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story
You'll find it's all been told

[Chorus]
But our love has a treasure
Our hearts can always spend
And it has a story
Without any end

[Verse 2]
At the end of a river
The water stops its flow
At the end of a highway
There's no place you can go

[Chorus]
But just tell me you love me
And you are only mine
And our love will go on
'Til the end of time

[Verse 2]
At the end of a river
The water stops its flow
At the end of a highway
There's no place you can go
You might also like[Chorus]
But just tell me you love me
And you are only mine
And our love will go on
'Til the end of time

[Outro]
'Til the end of time1Embed
