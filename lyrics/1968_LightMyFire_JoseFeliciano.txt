6 ContributorsLight My Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you, hey
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

[Verse 2]
Mm, the time for hesitation's through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Darling, we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Well, you know that it would be untrue
And you know that I would be a liar
If I was to go and tell you
Mama, we couldn't get much higher
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire, yeah
Try to set the night on fire, hey

[Outro]
Hey, come on, baby, light, light my fire, yeah
Come on, babe, light my fire
Don't you know it's all right?
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire
Oh, light my fire, light my fire, light my fire, yeah, girl
Girl, you better light my fire, yeah
You better light, you better light, you better light my fire
And we're gonna get much higher
Oh, come on, girl
You know I love you, girl
You know I need you, babe
Come on, light, light, light, light my fire
Light my fire
A-light my fire
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire
Light, light, light, light, light my, light my fireEmbed
