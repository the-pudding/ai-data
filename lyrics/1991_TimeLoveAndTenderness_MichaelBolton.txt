8 ContributorsTime, Love and Tenderness Lyrics[Intro]
Time, love and tenderness

[Verse 1]
So you say that you can't go on
Love left you cryin'
And you say, all your hope is gone
And what's the use in tryin'
What you need is to have some faith
Shake off those sad blues
Get yourself a new view
Oh, nothing is as sad as it seems, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause, some day you'll laugh at the heartache
Some day, you'll laugh at the pain
Somehow you'll get through the heartbreak
Somehow you can get through the rain

[Chorus]
When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness

I understand how you're feeling now
And what you've been through
But your world's gonna turn around
So baby, don't you be blue
All it takes is a little time
To make it better
The hurt won't last forever
Oh, all your tears are all gonna dry, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause some day you'll laugh at the heartache
Some day you'll laugh at the pain
You may be down on your luck
But baby, that old luck's gonna change

[Chorus]
When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
Baby, oh baby
Just need some, just need some
Time, love and tenderness
[Bridge]
The hurt ain't gonna last forever
Time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness

[Chorus] X5
When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Little bit time, love and tenderness

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness

Time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness
