Mirror, mirror on the wall
You said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I'd take a fall
Mirror, mirror on the wall

[Verse 1]
You, you turned my life
Into a paperback novel
Words that come to life
Inside your little melodrama
Chapter one, when I was young
I came to you with my problems
Chapter two, you promised me love
And anything that I desired

[Chorus]
Tell me, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said you had the answer to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall

[Verse 2]
You have nailed my heart
Upon the wall for your pleasure
You have cast a spell
That cannot ever be broken
And now my eyes grow tired
I watch my picture getting older
But I remain the same
Trapped in this mirror forever

Tell me, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall

[Bridge]
I talk to you each night
And I follow your advice
You've been wrong
What's the price I have to pay
For this fairy tale thing called love?
Let me go

[Chorus]
Tell me, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall

[Interlude]
Mirror, mirror
Let me go
Mirror, mirror
Mirror, mirror
Mirror, mirror
Mirror, mirror
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Tell me, mirror, mirror on the wall
I thought you said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me, mirror, mirror on the wall

[Outro]
Tell me, mirror
Tell me, mirror
Tell me, mirror
Tell me, mirrorEmbed
