10 ContributorsItâ€™s Over Lyrics[Intro]
Your baby doesn't love you anymore

[Verse 1]
Golden days before they end
Whisper secrets to the wind
Your baby won't be near you anymore
Tender nights before they fly
Send falling stars that seem to cry
Your baby doesn't want you anymore
It's over

[Bridge]
It breaks your heart in two
To know she's been untrue
But, oh, what will you do?
When she says to you
There's someone new
We're through, we're through
It's over, it's over, it's over

[Verse 2]
All the rainbows in the sky
Start to weep, then say goodbye
You won't be seeing rainbows anymore
Setting suns before they fall
Echo to you, "That's all, that's all"
But you'll see lonely sunsets after all
You might also like[Outro]
It's over, it's over, it's over
It's overEmbed
