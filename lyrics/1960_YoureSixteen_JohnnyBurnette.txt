Ooh, you come on like a dream
Peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine

You're all ribbons and curls
Ooh, what a girl
Eyes that twinkle and shine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
And ooh, when we kissed, we could not stop

[Chorus]
You walked out of my dreams into my arms
Now, you're my angel divine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine
