20 ContributorsBaby Love Lyrics[Intro]
Ooo-ooh

[Chorus]
Baby love, my baby love
I need you, oh how I need you (Baby love, ooh, baby love)

[Verse 1]
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me, what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long

[Chorus]
'Cause baby love, my baby love
Been missing ya, miss kissing ya (Baby love, ooh, baby love)

[Verse 2]
Instead of breaking up (Don't throw our love away)
Let's do some kissing and making up (Don't throw our love away)
Don't throw our love away
In my arms, why don't you stay? (Baby, baby, baby, ooh)

[Chorus]
Need ya, need ya (Baby love, baby love)
(Baby love, ooh, baby love)
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby love, my baby love
Why must we separate, my love? (Baby love, ooh, baby love)

[Verse 3]
All of my whole life through (Don't throw our love away)
I never loved no one but you (Don't throw our love away)
Why you do me like you do?
I get this need (Baby, baby, baby)

Ooh, ooh (Need you, need you)

[Chorus]
Need to hold you once again, my love (Baby love, baby love)
Feel your warm embrace, my love (Baby love, ooh, baby love)

[Verse 4]
Don't throw our love away (Don't throw our love away)
Please don't do me this way (Don't throw our love away)
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me (Baby, baby, baby, ooh)

[Chorus]
My love, my baby love (Baby love, baby love)
I need you, oh how I need you (Baby love, ooh, baby love)
Why you do me like you do? (Don't throw our love away)
After I've been true to you (Don't throw our love away)
So deep in love with you
Baby, baby, ooh (Baby, baby, baby, ooh)
[Outro]
'Til it's hurtin' me, 'til it's hurtin' me (Baby love, baby love)
Ooh, baby love (Baby love, ooh, baby love)
Don't throw our love away (Don't throw our love away)
Don't throw our love away (Don't throw our love away)Embed
