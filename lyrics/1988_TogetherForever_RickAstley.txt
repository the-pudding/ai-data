34 ContributorsTogether Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
If there's anything you need
All you have to do is say
You know you satisfy everything in me
We shouldn't waste a single day

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't stop me falling, it's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing, can't you hear me? I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Together forever and never to part
Together forever, we're two
And don't you know, I would move Heaven and Earth
To be together forever with you?

[Verse 2]
If they ever get you down
There's always something I can do
Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
I'll always do what's best for you

[Bridge]
There ain't no mistaking, it's true love we're making
Something to last for all time
It's never changing, can't you hear me? I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life
