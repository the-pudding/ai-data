2 ContributorsBlock Work Lyrics[Estribillo]
Let ‘em know: this is block work
We was riding dirty when we got searched
Who put me on to game? It was my pops first
Hustler 24 hours like it’s clock work
Let ‘em know: this is block work
We was riding dirty when we got searched
Who put me on to game? It was my pops first
Hustler 24 hours like it’s clock work


[Verso 1]
Nights strolls my sword big, it don’t fold
Niggas hearts is ice cold, watch it for light show
Shoot outs, my Brooklyn niggas selling cracks by the cyclone
Gag you in your crib, shut your pie hole

That’s how the dice roll, the Devil never taking my soul
Antichrist 9-11, seeing flights explode
Styrofoam cups filled with yac in it
Five different phones when you’re trafficking

Niggas is catching 10, me, I’m out here trying to win
Short stays at the Radisson stashing chips
Champagne bottles, gold like my Lazarus
Playing the Caddy, slick in the hood, reckless abandonment
You might also likeYeah… gambling shit and racketeering
My crib was small, so my son I had to bag up near him
Let them know: this is block works
School of hard knocks, I ain’t make it to Yale or Oxford


[Estribillo]
Let ‘em know: this is block work
We was riding dirty when we got searched
Who put me on to game? It was my pops first
Hustler 24 hours like it’s clock work
Let ‘em know: this is block work
We was riding dirty when we got searched
Who put me on to game? It was my pops first
Hustler 24 hours like it’s clock work


[Verso 2]
Yeah, Optimus Prime popular rhymes
Playboy concubines say raw out my mind
The booth now occupied, it’s a manslaughter
Facts that your man thought of black Audi like the Transporter

Crimes in the dark, rifles with lamps on them
To the cops, we Flash Gordon, they’ll shoot out your man’s organs
Stretch the work without aerobics
Back to life, Soul II Soul, shit niggas wondering how it’s on going
Lord knowing we in the Ritz-Carlton
Fish with lemon twist on it, got the files before the glitch started
You got the chip, Mark of the Beast, that shit haunting
Get assaulted coming out of blue jeans on 45th

I talk slick, it’s the fundamentals
Deadly like a bundle of fennel of instrumentals
Let them know: this is block works
School of hard knocks where niggas let off the Mossberg


[Estribillo]
Let ‘em know: this is block work
We was riding dirty when we got searched
Who put me on to game? It was my pops first
Hustler 24 hours like it’s clock work
Let ‘em know: this is block work
We was riding dirty when we got searched
Who put me on to game? It was my pops first
Hustler 24 hours like it’s clock work
