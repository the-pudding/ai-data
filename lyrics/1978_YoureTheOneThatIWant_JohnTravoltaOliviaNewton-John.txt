27 ContributorsYouâ€™re the One That I Want Lyrics[Verse 1: Danny]
I got chills, they're multiplying
And I'm losing control
'Cause the power you're supplying
It's electrifying

[Pre-Chorus: Sandy & Danny]
You better shape up, 'cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you (And my heart is set on you)
You better shape up, you better understand
To my heart, I must be true
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do

[Chorus: Danny & Sandy]
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The one I need (One I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes, indeed)

[Verse 2: Sandy]
If you're filled with affection
You're too shy to convey
Meditate in my direction
Feel your way

I better shape up, 'cause you need a man
I need a man who can keep me satisfied (Who can keep me satisfied)
I better shape up if I'm gonna prove
You better prove that my faith is justified
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure down deep inside

[Chorus: Danny & Sandy]
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
