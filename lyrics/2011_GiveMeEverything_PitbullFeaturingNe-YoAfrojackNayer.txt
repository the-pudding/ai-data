Me not workin' hard?
Yeah, right, picture that with a Kodak
Or, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all to know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, that's right

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Nayer]
Tonight
I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know
We might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight
Don't care what they say
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
'Til they handle love (Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em, "Hey"

But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab them
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it, 'cause if you slip
I'm gon' fall on top of your girl, hahahaha
What I'm involved with is deeper than the Mason's baby
Baby, and it ain't no secret
My family's from Cuba, but I'm an American idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest (Yeah)
[Refrain: Pitbull]
Put it on my life, baby (Baby)

Can't promise tomorrow (Nah)
But I promise tonight
