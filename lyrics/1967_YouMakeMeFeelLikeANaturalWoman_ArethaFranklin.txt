24 Contributors(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman Lyrics[Verse 1]
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired

[Pre-Chorus]
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (Woman)

[Verse 2]
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy, I don't need to do more

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (Woman)

Oh, baby, what you've done to me? (What you've done to me?)
You made me feel so good inside (Good inside)
And I just wanna be (Wanna be)
Close to you, you make me feel so alive

[Chorus]
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (Woman)
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (Woman)

[Outro]
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman6Embed
