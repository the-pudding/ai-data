2 ContributorsBobby Sox To Stockings LyricsWhen a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
And she starts trading her baby toys for boys
When that once-shy little sleepyhead
Learns about love and its lilt
You can bet that the change
Is more than from cotton to silk

If a miss wants to be kissed instead of cuddled
And to this you are in doubt as what to say
When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
Then she's old enough to give her heart away

When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
And she starts trading her baby toys for boys
When that once-shy little sleepyhead
Learns about love and its lilt
You can bet that the change
Is more than from cotton to silk

If a miss wants to be kissed instead of cuddled
And to this you are in doubt as what to say
When a girl changes from bobby sox to stockings
Then she's old enough to give her heart away

Yes, she's old enough to give her heart awaySee Frankie Avalon LiveGet tickets as low as $78You might also likeEmbed
