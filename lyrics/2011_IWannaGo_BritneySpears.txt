Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind, woah
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt
I got running through my mind, woah

[Verse 2]
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

Taking out my freak tonight

To need release (To need release)
