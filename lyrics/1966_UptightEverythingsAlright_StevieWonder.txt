20 ContributorsUptight (Everythingâ€™s Alright) Lyrics[Chorus]
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight

[Verse 1]
I'm a poor man's son from across the railroad tracks
Only should I own this hair on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight, because my heart is true

[Chorus]
She says, baby, everything is alright
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, and clean out of sight (Woo!)

[Verse 2]
She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I
I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see, I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight, because my heart is true
You might also like[Chorus]
She says baby, everything is alright
Uptight, clean out of sight (Woo!)
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight (Woo!)

Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, hahahahaha, yeah (Woo!)
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, way out of sight (Woo!)

Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight (Woo!)
BabyEmbed
