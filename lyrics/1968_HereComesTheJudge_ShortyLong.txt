Hear ye, hear ye
The court's in session
The court's in session, now
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge

[Chorus]
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge, y'all
Here comes the judge

[Verse 1]
Stop eatin' that fudge
'Cause here comes the judge
Don't nobody budge
'Cause here comes the judge
Judge Shorty is presidin' today
And he don't take no stuff from nobody
No kind of way
Hey boy, take off that hat
Where do you think you're at
I know where you gon' be
If you don't heed my plea
I'm here to tell you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
(Court's in session)
Order in the court, now
(Court's in session)
Can't nobody smoke now
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge

[Chorus]
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge, y'all
Here comes the judge

[Verse 2]
Order, order
What's the first case on the docket
Judge, I got a boy here who can't dance
Can't dance? Aww Can't dance, your Honor
Ninety days, thirty days for boogaloo
Thirty days to learn how to shing-a-ling
And thirty more for the Afro twist
Can't dance, what is this?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Court's in session)
Everybody, quiet now
(Court's in session)
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge
[Verse 3]
Is that the man?
No, your honor
Does he look like the man?
No, your Honor
Well, I'm sorry, you got to go there now
You, man, you can't recognize the man, you got to go
No, your Honor
Stand guilty

[Chorus]
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge, y'all
Here comes the judge

[Outro]
Got 2:45, yes, here comes the judge
They caught him stompin' down the aisle
Yes, here comes the judge
I'd rather be lost in the jungles of Brazil
Than to face the judge
This morning, the way he feels
Here comes the judge, y'all
Here comes the judge now
Don't nobody budge
'Cause here comes the judge
Everybody doin' their time todayEmbed
