32 ContributorsHot Stuff Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

[Chorus]
Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff, gotta have some love tonight
(Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need hot stuff

[Verse 2]
Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm-blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

[Chorus]
Gotta have some hot love, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin', gotta have love tonight (Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
Hot love, lookin' for hot love

Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot

[Chorus]
How's about some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'?
I need some hot stuff baby, tonight
Gimme a little hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Hot stuff, baby, gonna need your love tonight (Hot stuff)
I need hot love
Lookin' for hot stuff, wanna have hot love

[Verse 3]
Sittin' here eatin' my heart out, no reason
Won't spend another night on my own
I dialed about a hundred numbers lately
I'm bound to find somebody home
[Chorus]
Gonna have some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
Lookin' for my hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Need some lovin', baby, gonna need your love tonight
Hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight, yeah, yeah
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I want some hot stuff, baby, tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Hot stuff, baby
I need your hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want your hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Hot stuff, baby, gonna need your love tonight6Embed
