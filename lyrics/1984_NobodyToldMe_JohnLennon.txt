26 ContributorsNobody Told Me Lyrics[Intro]
...Three, four!

[Verse 1]
Well, everybody's talking, and no one says a word
Everybody's making love, and no one really cares
There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs
Always something happening and nothing going on
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China, so finish what you've got

[Chorus]
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Strange days indeed

[Verse 2]
Everybody's running, and no one makes a move
Well, everybody's a winner and nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu
Everybody's flying, and no one leaves the ground
Well, everybody's crying, and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in movies, you just gotta lay around
You might also like[Chorus]
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Most peculiar mama

[Verse 3]
Everybody's smoking, and no one's getting high
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's UFOs over New York, and I ain't too surprised

[Chorus]
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Most peculiar mama, roll!Embed
