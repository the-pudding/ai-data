7 ContributorsMemphis LyricsLong distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find a party
That tried to get in touch with me

She did not leave a number
But I know who placed the call
'Cause my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here
From Memphis, Tennessee

Her home is on the south side
High upon a ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi bridge

Last time I saw Marie
She was wavin' me goodbye
With "hurry-home" drops on her cheek
That trickled from her eye

But we were pulled apart
Because her mom did not agree
She tore apart our happy home
In Memphis, Tennessee

More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had

Marie is only six years old
Information, please
Got to get me through to her
In Memphis, TennesseeEmbed
