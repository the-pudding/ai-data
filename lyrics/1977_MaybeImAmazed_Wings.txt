Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Or maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
You hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man, maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me understand?
Ooh-ah
Baby, I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man, and you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?
Ooh-ah

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
Or maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
You right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man, you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Won't you help me understand?
Ooh-ah

[Outro]
Oh, baby, I'm a man
Babe, I'm a man
Yeah, babe, I'm a man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, babe, I'm a man
Hey, with youEmbed
