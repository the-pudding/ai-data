23 ContributorsSummertime Sadness (Cedric Gervais Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Drop]
I got that summertime
I got that summertime
I got that summertime
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime
I got that summertime
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Drop]
I got that summertime
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Got that summertime
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh2Embed
