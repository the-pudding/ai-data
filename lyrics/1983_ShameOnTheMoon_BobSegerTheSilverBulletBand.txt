10 ContributorsShame on the Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Until you've been beside a man
You don't know what he wants
You don't know if he cries at night
You don't know if he don't
Where nothing comes easy
Old nightmares are real
Until you've been beside a man
You don't know how he feels

[Verse 2]
Once inside a woman's heart
A man must keep his head
Heaven opens up the door
Where angels fear to tread
Some men go crazy
Some men go slow
Some men go just where they want
Some men never go

[Chorus]
Oh, blame it on midnight
Ooh, shame on the moon

[Piano Solo]
You might also like[Verse 3]
Everywhere it's all around
Comfort in the crowd
Strangers' faces all around
Laughin' right out loud
Hey, watch where you're goin'
Step light on old toes
'Cause until you've been beside a man
You don't know who he knows

[Chorus]
Oh, blame it on midnight
Ooh, shame on the moon
Oh, blame it on midnight
Ooh, shame on the moon

[Outro]
Blame it on midnight
You can blame it on midnight
Shame, shame, shame
Shame on the moon
You can blame it on midnight
Shame on the moon
Blame it on the moonEmbed
