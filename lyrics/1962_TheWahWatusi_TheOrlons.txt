7 ContributorsThe Wah-Watusi Lyrics[Intro]
Wah, wah-a Watusi
C'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance
Wah, wah-a Watusi
Oh, baby, it's the dance made-a for romance (shoo-bop, shoo-bop, ahh)

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, when you do The Twist
Never, never do you get yourself kissed
'Cause you're always dancing far apart
The Watusi, girl, is-a really smart

Wah-a, wah, wah-a Watusi
C'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance (shoo-bop, shoo-bop, ahh)

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, when you do The Fly
Your arms are wasted wavin' in the sky
Come on and hold me like a lover should
The Watusi makes you feel so good

Wah-a, wah, wah-a Watusi
Oh, baby, it's the dance made-a for romance

[Verse 3]
Baby, baby, that's the way it goes
Nothing happens when you Mash Potatoes
I just gotta fall in love with you
Watusi is the dance to do

Wah-a, wah, wah-a Watusi
C'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance
Wah, wah-a Watusi
Oh, baby, it's the dance made-a for romanceEmbed
