10 ContributorsWhen the Children Cry Lyrics[Verse 1:]
Little child dry your crying eyes
How can I explain the fear you feel inside
Cause you were born into this evil world
Where man is killing man and no one knows just why
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again

[Chorus:]
When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 2:]
Little child you must show the way
To a better day for all the young
Cause you were born for all the world to see
That we all can live with love and peace
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

[Chorus]
When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 3:]
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

When the children fight let them know it ain't right
When the children pray let them know the way
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins4Embed
