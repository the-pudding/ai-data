37 ContributorsSon of a Preacher Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Billy-Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit, he'd come along
When they gathered 'round and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
Out through the back yard, we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows, to my surprise

[Chorus]
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was, he was
Ooh, yes, he was

[Verse 2]
Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everything is alright
He'd kiss and tell me everything is alright
Can I get away again tonight?

[Chorus]
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was (Was), he was (Was)
(Ooh) Lord knows he was
(Yes, he was)

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown and

[Chorus]
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was (Was), he was (Was)
Oh, yes, he was

[Outro]
(The only one who could ever reach me)
He was the sweet-talkin' son of a preacher man
(The only boy who could ever teach me)
I kissed the son of a preacher man
(The only one who could ever move me)
The sweet-lovin' son of a preacher man
(The only one who could ever groove me)
Was the son of a preacher man
(The only one who could ever reach me)
Was the son of a preacher man5Embed
