I come up hard, baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, sugar, playing by the rules
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checking trouble, sugar, moving down the line
I come up hard, baby, but that's okay
'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way

[Post-Verse 1]
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
Gonna keep moving, gonna go to town
I come up hard, I come up gettin' down
There's only three things, that's for sure
Taxes, death, and trouble, oh
This I've known, baby, this I've known, sugar
Yeah, ain't gonna let it sweat me, babe

[Interlude]
It's got me singing
Yeah, yeah
Woo-ooh

[Verse 2]
I come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took care of my business with all my might
I come up hard, awful hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I come up hard, but that's okay
'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way, hey, hey
You might also like[Bridge]
I know some places
And I see some faces
I got good connections
They dig my directions
What people say, that's okay
They don't bother me, no
I'm ready to make it
Don't care what the weather
Don't care 'bout no trouble
Got myself together
I feel that kind of protection
That's all around me

[Post-Verse 2]
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby, with the troubled minds
I'm moving, going to town
I come up hard, I come up gettin' down
There's only three things for sure
Taxes, death, and trouble, oh
This I've known, baby, this I've known, baby
Ain't gonna let it sweat me, babe
Woo, oh lord, baby

[Verse 3]
Woo, I come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playing by the rules
I come up hard, baby, now I'm fine
I'm checking trouble, sugar
[Outro]
Hey, moving down the line, oh2Embed
