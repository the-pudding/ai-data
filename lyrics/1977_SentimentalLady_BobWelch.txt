10 ContributorsSentimental Lady Lyrics[Verse 1]
You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

[Bridge]
Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that they say are very

[Chorus]
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one (All I need is you)
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

Ooh, sentimental lady

[Verse 2]
Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that they say are very
You might also like[Chorus]
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one (All I need is you)
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one (All I need is you)

[Verse 1]
All of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that they say are very (All I need is you)

All of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you1Embed
