1 ContributorYoung Lovers LyricsWe pledged our love to each other
We know that our love will last
Paula, I give you my heart
Yours in return's all I ask
We've waited so long for this moment
Tomorrow is our special day
I'll take you, Paul, & you only
Here in my heart you will stay
So good luck to Paul & Paula
Good luck, young lovers everywhere
If your love is strong, then you can't go wrong
True love will find a way
Paula, I give you my heart
Paul, I've been waiting for you
Good luck to Paul & Paula
Good luck, young lovers everywhere
If your love is strong, then you can't go wrong
Good luck, young lovers, tonight
Good luck, young lovers everywhere
