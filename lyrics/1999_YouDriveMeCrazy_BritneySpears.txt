Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping, it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

[Chorus]
You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wasting my feelings on you
