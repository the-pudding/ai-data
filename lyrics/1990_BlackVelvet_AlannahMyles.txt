[?]

[Verse 1]
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmie Rodgers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

[Chorus]
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Verse 2]
Up in Memphis, the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

[Pre-Chorus]
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for
You might also like[Chorus]
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Bridge]
Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash, he was gone, it happened so soon
What could you do?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Outro]
If you please
If you please
If you please10Embed
