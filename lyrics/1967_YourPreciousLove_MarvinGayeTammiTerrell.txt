11 ContributorsYour Precious Love Lyrics[Intro: Marvin Gaye]
Oooh, oooh, oooh

[Verse 1: Marvin Gaye]
Every day, there's something new (Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby)
Honey, to keep me loving you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey)
And with every passing minute (Ooh, ooh, ooh, sugar)
Ah, baby, so much joy wrapped up in it

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Oh, oh, oh
Heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, oh, oh
Heaven must have sent your precious love
Oh

[Verse 2: Tammi Terrell]
And now, I've got a song to sing (Ooh, ooh, ooh, darling)
Telling the world about the joy you bring (Ooh, ooh, ooh, sweetheart)
And you gave me a reason for living (Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey)
And ooh, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of giving

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Oh, oh, oh
Heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, oh, oh
Heaven must have sent your precious love
Oh
You might also like[Bridge: Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell]
To find a love like yours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
I look in the mirror and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be

[Verse 3: Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell]
What you've given me, I could never return (Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby)
'Cause there's so much, girl, I've yet to learn, honey (Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey)
And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation (Ooh, ooh, ooh, sugar)
'Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Woah, oh, oh
Heaven must have sent you from above
Woah, oh, oh
Heaven must have sent your precious love
Woah, oh, oh
Heaven must have sent you from above
Woah, oh, oh
Heaven must have sent your precious loveEmbed
