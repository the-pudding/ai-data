10 ContributorsMama Said Lyrics[Chorus]
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, Mama said
(Mama said, Mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, Mama said)

[Verse 1]
I went walking the other day
And everything was going fine
I met a little boy named Billy Joe
And then almost lost my mind

[Chorus]
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, Mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said

[Verse 2]
My eyes were wide open
But all that I can see is
Chapel bells are callin'
For everyone but-a me
But I don't worry 'cause
You might also like[Chorus]
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, Mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said

[Verse 3]
And then she said someone will look at me
Like I'm looking at you, one day
And then I might find I don't want you any-a-way
So I don't worry 'cause

[Chorus]
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, Mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said

[Outro]
(Mama said, Mama said, hey, hey)
Don't you worry
(Mama said, Mama said, hey, hey)
Don't you worry now
(Mama said, Mama said, hey, hey)
(Mama said, Mama said, hey, hey)
Mama said there'll be days like this
(Mama said, Mama said, hey, hey)
There'll be days like this, Mama said
(Mama said, Mama said, hey, hey)
Mama said there'll be days like this
(Mama said, Mama said, hey, hey)
There'll be-a days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, Mama said, hey, hey)
Mama said there'll be days like thisEmbed
