Steep grade up ahead, slow me down, makin' no time
But I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers slappin' out a tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
But I gotta keep rollin'

Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

Well, the truck stop cutie comin' on to me
Tried to talk me into a ride, said I wouldn't be sorry
But she was just a baby
Hey, waitress, pour me another cup of coffee
Pop it down, jack me up, shoot me out, flyin' down the highway
Lookin' for the mornin'

Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

Well, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead, slow me down, makin' no time
But I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers slappin' out a tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
But I gotta keep rollin'
