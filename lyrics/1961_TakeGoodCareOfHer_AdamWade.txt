For you've won the only girl
I ever loved

But I hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her
Take good care of her

Just to be around her
Was my greatest pleasure
She was everything
My future held in store

So, remember
When you take my only treasure
Please, take good care of her
Take good care of her

I must accept it
She loves you more than me
So with my broken heart
I'll bow out gracefully

Please don't send me
Any wedding invitation
For I couldn't bear to see her there with you
You might also likeIf she's happy
That will be my consolation
So, take good care of her
Take good care of her

Take good care of her
Take good care of herEmbed
