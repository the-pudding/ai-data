6 ContributorsGypsy Woman Lyrics[Verse 1]
From nowhere through a caravan
Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

[Chorus]
She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman

[Verse 2]
She danced around and round
To a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd love to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

[Chorus]
I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman

[Bridge]
All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she'll never know
That I love her
I love her
You might also like[Outro]
Gypsy woman
I love a gypsy woman
I love a gypsy woman
I love a gypsy woman
I love a gypsy womanEmbed
