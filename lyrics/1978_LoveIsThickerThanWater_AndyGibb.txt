6 Contributors(Love Is) Thicker Than Water Lyrics[Chorus Intro]
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

[Verse 1]
Say, my mind
Should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm living for

[Chorus]
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

[Instrumental Break]
You might also like[Verse 2]
Say, my thought
Should I find out she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for

[Chorus Intro] X2
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

[Instrumental Break]
