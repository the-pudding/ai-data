You must understand, oh, the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meetin' girl
Opposites attract

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that
Oh

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Verse 2]
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed, I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason, you do it for me
Oh
You might also like[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
Ooh

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
I've been takin' on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
(What's love?) Got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
[Outro]
(What's love got to do?) Ooh, got to do with it
(What's love but a second-hand emotion?)
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
(What's love?) Ooh, ooh
(Got to do with it) Got to do with it
(What's love?) But a second-hand emotion11Embed
