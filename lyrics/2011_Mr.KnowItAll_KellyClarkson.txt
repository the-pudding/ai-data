Mr. Know-It-All
Well, ya, you think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Ain't it, ain't it something, y'all?
When somebody tells you something 'bout you
Think that they know you more than you do
So ya take it down, another pill to swallow

[Verse 2]
Mr. Bring-Me-Down
Well, ya, ya like to bring me down
Don't ya? But I ain't layin' down
Baby, I ain't goin' down
Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be
Nobody gonna make a fool outta me, baby
You should know that I lead, not follow

[Chorus]
Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leavin' you lonely, lonely
'Cause, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Actin' like you own me lately
Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

Mr. Play-Your-Games
Only got yourself to blame
When ya want me back again
But I ain't fallin' back again
'Cause I'm livin' my truth without your lies
Let's be clear, baby, this is goodbye
I ain't comin' back tomorrow

[Chorus]
Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leavin' you lonely, lonely
'Cause, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Actin' like you own me lately
Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

[Bridge]
So what? You've got the world at your feet
And you know everything about everything
But you don't
You still think I'm comin' back, but baby, you'll see, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, you think that you know me, know me (Yeah, yeah)
That's why I'm leavin' you lonely, lonely (Oh)
'Cause, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me (Oh, you think that you know me, know me)
You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me (That's why I'm leavin' you lonely, lonely)
Actin' like you own me lately
Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me (That's why I'm leavin' you lonely, lonely)
You don't know a thing about me

[Outro]
Mr. Know-It-All
Well, ya, you think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all, ain't it
Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me11Embed
