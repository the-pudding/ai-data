5 ContributorsCherish Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cherish is a word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside

[Chorus]
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could mold you Into someone who could cherish me as much as I cherish you

[Verse 2]
Perish is a word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize

[Chorus]
When I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams
When I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes
When I am not gonna be the one to share what seems
To be the life that you could cherish as much as I do yours

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm beginnin' to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters, just the right sound
That could make you hear, make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind
Oh, I could say I need you, but then you'd realize
That I want you just like a thousand other guys
Who'd say they love you with all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes

[Chorus]
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could mold you
Into someone who could cherish me as much as I cherish you

[Post-Chorus]
And I do
Cherish you
And I do
Cherish you
