21 ContributorsSlow Down Lyrics[Intro]
Tim & Bob, Bobby Valentino
You know how we do
It's another one

[Verse 1]
I saw you walking down on Melrose
You looked like an angel straight out of Heaven, girl
I was blown away by your sexiness
Now all I have to do is catch up to you

[Chorus]
Slow down
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

[Verse 2]
A butterfly tattoo right above your navel
Your belly button's pierced too, just like I like it, girl
Come take a walk with me, you'll be impressed by the game that I kick to you, it's so thorough and real, yeah
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, hope you're ready
I'm in awe 'cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you (Enjoy you)
Let's kick it, girl

[Chorus]
So slow down
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around (Turn around)
And bless me with your beauty, cutie
Slow down (Yeah)
I just wanna get to know you (To know you, baby)
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me (So, yeah)
Slow down
Never seen anything so lovely (So lovely, baby)
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

[Bridge]
Oh baby you know by now that I want you (Bad)
I'm floating on thin air, I can't come (Down)
Cupid hit me already (Damn)
Now I can't leave 'til seven digits are in my hand, my hand
[Pre-Chorus]
Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, hope you're ready
I'm in awe cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you (Enjoy you)
Let's kick it girl

[Chorus]
Slow down
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie
Slow down
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

[Outro]
Bless me with your beauty, baby
You, I just wanna tell you
Oh, it looks good, oh, it looks good
Slow down
Never seen anything so lovely
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh (Cutie)
[Chorus]
Slow down
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie2Embed
