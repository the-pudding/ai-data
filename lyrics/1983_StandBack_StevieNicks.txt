15 ContributorsStand Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
No one looked as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him again and again
First, he took my heart, then he ran
No one knows how I feel
What I say, unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand
Take me home

[Chorus]
Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line (Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la

[Verse 2]
Do not turn away my friend
Like a willow, I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came
So, I walked on down, away from you
Maybe your attention was more than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love, and that was all

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line (Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la la la
Doo-doo, doo-doo
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la, wo-ah

[Breakdown]
So, I walked, walked down the line, away from you
Maybe your attention was more than I could do
One man did not call
Well, he asked me for my love, that was all

[Chorus]
Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line (Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry
[Outro]
Well maybe I need a little sympathy
Well, I need a little sympathy (Cry)
Well, I need a little sympathy
A-well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Take me home
Take me home (Stand back)
Won't you take me home?
Well, I need a little sympathy (Stand back)
A-well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Why don't you take me home?
Why don't you take me home? (Stand back)
Take me home (Alright)
Take me home, me home (Alright)Embed
