8 ContributorsSink The Bismarck Lyrics[Verse 1]
In May of 1941 the war had just begun
The Germans had the biggest ship that had the biggest guns
The Bismarck was the fastest ship that ever sailed the sea
On her decks were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

[Verse 2]
Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And every British seaman, he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismarck, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

[Chorus]
We'll find the German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
Yeah, hit the decks a runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down

[Verse 3]
The Hood found the Bismarck and on that fatal day
The Bismarck started firin' fifteen miles away
"We gotta sink the Bismark" was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away, the mighty Hood went down

[Verse 4]
For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people "Put every ship a-sail
'Cause somewhere on that ocean, I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismarck to the bottom of the sea!"

We'll find the German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
Yeah, hit the decks a runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down

[Verse 5]
The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismark made its' run
The admiral of the British fleet said "Turn those bows around"
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down

[Verse 6]
The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismark, they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
"Sink the Bismarck" was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

[Chorus]
We'll find the German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
Yeah, hit the decks a runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down
We'll find the German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
Yeah, hit the decks a runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her downEmbed
