20 ContributorsThe Letter Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train

[Refrain]
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby just wrote me a letter

[Verse 2]
I don't care how much money I gotta spend
Got to get back to my baby again

[Refrain]
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby just wrote me a letter

[Bridge]
Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen mister, can't you see
I got to get back to my baby once more?
Any way, yeah
