I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there?
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame, I'm just trippin'

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the makeup
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel so
Damn unpretty

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too

Never insecure until I met you, now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me, just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things to keep you happy?
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame, can't believe I'm trippin'

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the makeup
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel so
Damn unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
And you can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the makeup
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel so
Damn unpretty
[Post-Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
And make you feel unpretty too
And make you feel unpretty

[Bridge: T-Boz & Chilli]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the makeup
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel so
Damn unpretty

[Outro: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow (Hahaha)
You can buy all the makeup
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Be in the position that made me feel so
You can buy your hair if it won't grow10Embed
