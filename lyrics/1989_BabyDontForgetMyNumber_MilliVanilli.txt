10 ContributorsBaby Donâ€™t Forget My Number LyricsOkay
Okay, Eddie
This one's for you

Baby, don't be shy
When you're holding my hand
'Cause as time goes by
You got to understand it's you
(Can I dance with you?)

Ba-ba-ba-baby, in your eyes
I see it so clearly that our love is so strong
And you'll never go wrong
(Eddie) I do the best for you

So when you're in doubt
And you're needing someone
Baby, call my line, call me anytime
(Eddie) I'll be there for you (you, you)

I've been searching high (high, high)
I've been searching low (low, low)

Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Don't forget my number
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Love is stronger than thunder
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Don't forget my number
Love will see you through

I've been searching low
Wanna spend my life with you
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, love will see you through

Ba-ba-ba-baby, in your eyes
I see it so clearly that our love is so strong
And you'll never go wrong
(Eddie) I do the best for you

So when you're in doubt
And you're needing someone
Baby, call my line, call me anytime
(Eddie) I'll be there for you (you, you)

Wanna spend my life with you
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, can I dance with you?
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba
