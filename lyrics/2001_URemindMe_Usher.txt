Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got somethin' to tell you
Listen

[Verse 1]
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See, this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Chorus]
But you remind me of a girl that I once knew (Oh, oh)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Have a bad look, I look)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Won't believe, won't believe, won't believe it, baby, uh, oh no, no)
This is why I just can't get with you

[Verse 2]
Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexin' everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

You remind me of a girl that I once knew (No, no no no, no, ah yeah)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Have a bad look, I look at you)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (She put me through, yeah)
This is why I just can't get with you (Uh)

[Bridge]
(I know, yeah)
I know it's so unfair to you (Ha! It's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you (Whoa, oh I)
Wish I knew (Wish I knew how to separate the two)
You remind me (You remind me)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ah, oh...

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Gotta let you go)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Said I had, huh)
This is why I just can't get with you (Gotta let you go)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (You remind me, of a girl, hey)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Hey! Oh! Oh! You wouldn't believe it)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (All the shit she put me through)
This is why I just can't get with you (No no)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (You remind me of a girl that, that I once knew, oh no no)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Oh no, no, no, no)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you (You wouldn't believe [?])
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (Uh, baby I'm sorry, I gotta let you go, oh whoa, no)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Baby I'm sorry, I gotta let you go, no, no, no)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Oh no, oh no)
This is why I just can't get with you (You remind me)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (Of a girl that I once knew, yeah, yeah, yeah)
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (All the things she put me, me through, yeah)
This is why I just can't get with you
[Outro]
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you24Embed
