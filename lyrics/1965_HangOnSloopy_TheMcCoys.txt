Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, Sloopy

Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town
And everybody, yeah, tries to put my Sloopy down
Sloopy, I don't care what your daddy do
'Cause you know, Sloopy, girl, I'm in love with you

Give it to 'em, right now!

Let it hang down on me
Sloopy, let your hair down, girl (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
