Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?

[Verse 2]
I believe it's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning (Burning) an eternal (Eternal) flame?

[Chorus]
Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don't wanna lose this feelin', oh

[Chorus]
Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don't wanna lose this feelin', oh
