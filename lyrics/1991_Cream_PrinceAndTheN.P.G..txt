This is Prince
Prince and the New Power Generation
Prince and the New Power Generation

[Verse 1: Prince with Rosie Gaines]
This is it
It's time for you to go to the wire
You will hit
Cause you got the burning desire
It's your time
Time
You got the horn so why don't you blow it
You are fine
Fine
You're filthy cute and baby you know it

[Chorus: Prince]

You're so good
Baby there ain't nobody better
Ain't nobody better
So you should
Never, ever go by the letter
Never ever
You're so cool
Cool
Everything you do is success
Make the rules
Rules
Then break them all cause you are the best
Yes you are

[Chorus: Prince and Rosie Gaines]

Look up in the air, it's your guitar
Do your dance
Why should you wait any longer?
Take a chance
It could only make you stronger
It's your time
It's your time
You got the horn so why don't you blow it
Go on and blow it
You're so fine
You're so fine
You're filthy cute and baby you know it
You know it
