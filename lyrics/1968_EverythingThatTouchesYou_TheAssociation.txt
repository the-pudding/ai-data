4 ContributorsEverything That Touches You Lyrics[Verse 1]
In my most secure moments, I still can't believe
I'm spending those moments with you
And the ground I am walking, the air that I breathe
Are shared at those moments with you

[Chorus]
You love for real, you show the feel
Of everything that touches you

[Verse 2]
In the songs I've been singing, quite often a phrase
Comes close to the feeling of you
But I never suspected that one of those days
The wish of a song would come true

[Chorus]
You love for real, you show the feel
Of everything that touches you

[Bridge]
You are of gracefulness, you are of happiness
You are what I would guess to be most like
What I've been singing of

[Break]

In the songs I've been singing, quite often a phrase
Comes close to the feeling of you
But I never suspected that one of those days
The wish of a song would come true

[Chorus]
You love for real, you show the feel
Of everything that touches you

[Outro]
(Love, love, love, love)
Everything is love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Everything is love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Everything is love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Everything is love...Embed
