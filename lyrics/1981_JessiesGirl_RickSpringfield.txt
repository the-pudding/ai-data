33 ContributorsJessieâ€™s Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

[Chorus]
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

[Verse 2]
I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman...
Where can I find a woman like that?

[Bridge]
And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

[Interlude]
Tell me where can I find a woman like that?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want, I want Jessie's girl15Embed
