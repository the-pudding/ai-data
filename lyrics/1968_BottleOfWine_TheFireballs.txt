Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?

Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over

[Verse 1]
Ramblin' around
This dirty old town
A-singin' for nickles and dimes

Times gettin' rough
I ain't got enough
To buy me a bottle of wine
Yeah

[Chorus]
Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?

Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over
You might also like[Verse 2]
A pain in my head
There's bugs in my bed
My pants are so old that they shine

Out on the street
I tell the people I meet
To buy me a bottle of wine
Whoa!

[Coda]
Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?

Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over

Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?

Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over
Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?

Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over

[Outro]
Let me go home and start over
Let me go home and start overEmbed
