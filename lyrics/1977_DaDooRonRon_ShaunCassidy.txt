I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Somebody told me that her name was Jill
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

[Chorus]
Yeah, my heart stood still
Yes, her name was Jill
And when I walked her home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

[Verse 2]
I knew what she was thinkin' when she caught my eye
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
She looked so quiet but my oh my
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

[Chorus]
Yeah, she caught my eye
Yes, my oh my
And when I walked her home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

[Break]
(Ooh)
(Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron)
(Ooh)
(Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron)

Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Someday soon I'm gonna make her mine
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yeah, she looked so fine
Yes, I'll make her mine
And when I walked her home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

[Outro]
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
