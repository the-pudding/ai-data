11 ContributorsLove Is in the Air Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Love is in the air
In the whisper of the trees
Love is in the air
In the thunder of the sea

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name

[Chorus]
Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh-oh-oh
Mm-ooh, ooh-ooh
You might also like[Verse 3]
Love is in the air
In the risin' of the sun
Love is in the air
When the day is nearly done

And I don't know if you're an illusion
Don't know if I see it true
But you're something that I must believe in
And you're there when I reach out for you

[Verse 4]
Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Oh, love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh4Embed
