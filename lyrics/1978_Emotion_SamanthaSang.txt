10 ContributorsEmotion Lyrics[Verse 1: Samantha Sang]
It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Samantha Sang]
And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

[Bridge: Barry Gibb and Samantha Sang]
You know that
There'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight (goodnight, goodnight), goodnight
You might also like[Verse 2: Samantha Sang]
I'm there at your side
I'm part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You go to find your shining star

[Pre-Chorus: Samantha Sang]
And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

[Bridge: Barry Gibb and Samantha Sang]
You know that
There'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
[Pre-Chorus: Samantha Sang]
And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

[Bridge: Barry Gibb and Samantha Sang]
You know that
There'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight (goodnight, goodnight) ohh

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling...3Embed
