Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Bass, bass, bass, bass

Three

[Verse 1]
With music by our side to break the color lines
Let's work together to improve our way of life
Join voices in protest to social injustice
A generation full of courage, come forth with me

[Chorus]
People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
Sing!
We are a part of the rhythm nation
People of the world unite
Strength in numbers, we can get it right, one time
Sing it up!
We are a part of the rhythm nation

[Verse 2]
This is the test, no struggle, no progress (Lend)
Lend a hand to help your brother do his best
Things are getting worse, we have to make them better
It's time to give a damn, let's work together
Come on now
