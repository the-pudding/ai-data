21 ContributorsDonâ€™t Get Me Wrong Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong
If I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights
Whenever you walk by

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong
If you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon
Is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong
If I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks
That go off when you smile

[Verse 4]
Don't get me wrong
If I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander
Across a moonlit mile

[Bridge]
Once in a while, two people meet
Seemingly for no reason
They just pass on the street
Suddenly, thunder showers everywhere
And who can explain the thunder and rain?
But there's something in the air

[Verse 5]
Don't get me wrong
If I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow
But hopeless yesterday

[Verse 6]
Don't get me wrong
If I fall in the mode of fashion
It might be unbelievable
But let's not say so long
It might just be fantastic
Don't get me wrong2Embed
