7 ContributorsBlowinâ€™ in the Wind Lyrics[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must those cannonballs be fired before they're forever banned?
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Let me tell you that the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Oh, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
(Well. how many years?)
How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea? Yeah
How many years can a man exist before he's allowed to be free? Yeah
Now, how many times can a man turn his head and he pretends that he just doesn't see?
Whoa, yeah

[Chorus]
You know the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Uh-huh

[Outro]
Uh-huh
And let me tell you it's blowin' (Blowin')
Blowin' (Blowin')
And it's blowin'
Oh, the answer is blowin' in the wind
And it's blowin', yeah yeah yeah
The answer is blowin' in the windYou might also likeEmbed
