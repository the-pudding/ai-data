Easy, ready, willin’, overtime
Where does it stop?
Where do you dare me
To draw the line?
You've got the body
Now you want my soul
Don't even think about it
Say, “No go”

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I, I'll do anything
That you want me to
Yeah, I'll do almost anything
That you want me to, ooh
Yeah

[Chorus]
But I can't go for that, no (No)
No can do
I can't go for that, no (No)
No can do
I can't go for that, no (No)
No can do
I can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that
