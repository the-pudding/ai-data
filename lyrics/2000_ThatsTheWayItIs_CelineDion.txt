18 ContributorsThatâ€™s the Way It Is Lyrics[Intro]
Mm, mm
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can read your mind
And I know your story
I see what you're going through, yeah
It's an uphill climb
And I'm feeling sorry
But I know it will come to you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't surrender
'Cause you can win
In this thing called love

[Chorus]
When you want it the most
There's no easy way out
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
You might also like[Verse 2]
When you question me
For a simple answer
I don't know what to say, no
But it's plain to see
If you stick together
You're gonna find a way, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't surrender
'Cause you can win
In this thing called love

[Chorus]
When you want it the most
There's no easy way out
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up on your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
That's the way it is

[Bridge]
When life is empty
With no tomorrow
And loneliness starts to call (Loneliness starts to call)
Baby, don't worry
Forget your sorrow
'Cause love's gonna conquer it all
All
[Chorus]
When you want it the most
There's no easy way out
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up on your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is (Oh)
(There's no easy way out)
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt (Uh-huh)
Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up on your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
That's the way it is

[Outro]
(That's the way it is)
That's the way it is, babe
(That's the way it is)
Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up on your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is6Embed
