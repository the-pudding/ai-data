Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Ooh, you and me, girl, got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Then my life, I can see beyond forever
Everything we are will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

[Chorus: Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

[Verse 3: Barry Gibb]
You and me, girl, got a highway to the sky
We can turn away
From the night and day
And the tears we had to cry
You might also like[Verse 4: Barry Gibb]
You're my life, I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we are will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love

[Chorus: Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

[Interlude: Barry Gibb]
Oh
Oh
Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

[Chorus: Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river and harder to climb
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb
[Outro: Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line, oh
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb5Embed
