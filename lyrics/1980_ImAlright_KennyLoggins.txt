1 ContributorWho? (Feat. LTtheMonk) Lyrics[Hook: Hoss Bowman]
Who got names in their mouth?
I know that they be talking shit
I’m trying to light
Who got the lighter?
Who pocketed it?
You ain’t gotta ask the question
Who be rocking in there?
And who hell don't talk when the gossiper there?
Who got names in their mouth?
I know that they be talking shit
I’m trying to light
Who got the lighter?
Who pocketed it?
You ain’t gotta ask the question
Who be rocking in there?
And who hell don't talk when the gossiper there?

[Verse 1: Hoss Bowman]
Hey who was that there?
Who was that back then?
I'm bringing the juice
Who's bringing gin?
My medicine
Who's gone knock to let us in?
Who's been smoking lettuce?
I smell it and I didn't get a hit
Better get several hits
Pleasure not to be meddled with
Picking petals
Ever since whoever ended it
If you a TV
Ima need me a premium membership
Tell me he who is better than me at tedious penmanship
I get greedy like elephant
Was gluttonous like a rhino
Cutting right through the line up
Do something for my survival
Saying bye though i just smile
And wave like tidal
Always blowing like Chicago
Put your plane into a spiral
Mayday like 2 months before august
Talking shit about me
But I'm alright
Kenny Loggins
I'm a punk
I pull the pistol
Like I'm fucking Johnny Rotten
Everyday I'm doing dunks
Like I'm fucking Dennis Rodman

Who pocketed it?
You ain’t gotta ask the question
Who be rocking in there
And who hell don't talk when the gossiper there

[Verse 2: Hoss Bowman]
Rocket-powered rocking chair
Blasting out the condo
905 but at the time
Was blasted in Toronto
Got to the bottom of the bottle
Smash the glass
Sound like staccato
GTA no grand theft auto
Who be keeping it full throttle?
Just me and the top don dadas
Mother fucker might go loon for a dollar
I bet you hating
I'm so decorated
You would have thought i had got honors
I might only know 10 who keep it one hunnid
I might know 20 I know who doubt me
And bitch if I run into the money I count it
Purpose is to run circles around it
Who was saying that and who told you that one
Smoking that motherfucking mid like Malcolm
That's who and how and I'm where you found me
So what the fuck you gonna do about it?
[Intro: LTtheMonk]
Yeah
What you gone do?

[Verse 3: LTtheMonk]
Birth, death and metaxis
Like birth, death and my taxes
It's certain with this rap shit
I spin on a meta axis
I access a higher plane
I'm Plato applying pain
Divinely inhumane
Define me as hue A
Original man with this brown skin
Godly some do say
Sean with the Black excellence
Sip Ciroc, sip D'Usse
Puff, Hov and the new age
LTtheMonk that's all day
Jiggy, Jigga and Cool J
Mama said let them fools play
You stay low
Then knock out
1 EP then rock out
With 2 tapes and 3 albums
Kinks, Drinks
What it's all about
What it's all about
What it's all about
With Kinks, Drinks & Hip-Hop
Mange Tout
