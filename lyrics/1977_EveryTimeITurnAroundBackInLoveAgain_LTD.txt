4 Contributors(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again Lyrics[Chorus]
Every time I move, I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love

[Verse 1]
I get mixed emotions
It's the way my feelings flow
Excuse me, I'm only human
Sometimes I, I just don't know

[Chorus]
Every time I move, I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Back in love again
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Back in love

[Verse 2]
When you put your arms around me
I feel so satisfied
I want to love you forever
I just can't, I can't decide
You might also like[Chorus]
Every time I move, I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again
(Right back, right back in love again)
Alright
(Seems like, seems like)
Back in love again

[Verse 3]
Now it's your lover
I know it's hard just to be a friend
That's something else I discovered
I guess I just don't ever want it to end

[Chorus]
Every time I move, I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again
(Right back, right back in love again)
(Seems like, seems like)
That I'm back in love again
(Right back, right back in love again)
Oh yeah, alright
(Seems like, seems like)
I'm back in love again
[Outro]
I just don't believe it
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
I can't believe it
(Right back, I'm back)
Every time I turn around
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
I get so many mixed emotions
I'm back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
Every time I turn around
Oh, my love Jones coming down
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
Alright, alright, alright
(I'm back, I'm back)
Help me, help me, help me, back in love
(I'm back, I'm back)
Oh yeah, back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
I get so many mixed emotions, yes I do
(Right back, I'm back)
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey
(Right back, I'm back)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
(Right back, I'm back)
Hear me, hear me, hear me, I'm back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
I was once your lover, I was once your lover
And then I'm just your friend, yeah
Oh, I'm back in love
(Right back, I'm back)
I'm back in love, I'm back in love, I'm back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)Embed
