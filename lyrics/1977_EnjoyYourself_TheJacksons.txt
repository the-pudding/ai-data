Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
You better enjoy yourself
You better enjoy yourself

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
You sittin' over there, starin' into space
Awhile people are dancin', dancin' all over the place
But you shouldn't worry about things you can't control
Come on, girl, while the night is young
Why don't she let, let herself go "Woo!"

[Chorus]
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Let's have some fun
Let's have a good time, you and me
Sittin' there with your mouth poked out
Just as sweet as you can be
Why don't you live, live the life you got
Come on girl, let's get it, while the music's runnin' hot, woo!

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me

[Bridge: Jackie Jackson]
Pretty girl, I've been watchin' you
I can wipe away that frown
Ah, you and I could get together
We could tear the house down, we could tear the house down
We could tear the whole house down, woo!

[Chorus]
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
You better enjoy yourself
You got to enjoy yourself
Say it again, enjoy yourself (Enjoy yourself!)
Enjoy yourself (Let's get on down!)
Enjoy yourself (Enjoy yourself!)
Enjoy yourself (Let's get on down!)
Enjoy yourself (Enjoy yourself!)
Enjoy yourself (Let's get on down!)
Enjoy yourself (Enjoy yourself!)
Enjoy yourself (Let's get on down!)
[Interlude]
Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on)
Come on (You can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it)
Woo!
Ah ha ha ha, let's get on down, ooh!
