Mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
I wish I had you, to talk to

[Verse 1]
If a man ever needed dying, he did
No one had the right to say what he said about you
And it's so cold and lonely here without you
Out there the law's a-coming
I'm scared and so tired of running

[Chorus]
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
I wish I had you, to talk to

[Verse 2]
It hurts to see the man that I've become
And to know I'll never see the morning sunshine on the land
I'll never see your smiling face or touch your hand
If just once more I could see
You, our home and our little baby
You might also like[Chorus]
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there, oh
I wish I had you, to talk to

[Verse 3]
I hope this letter finds its way to you
Forgive me, love, for the shame I've put you through, and all the tears
Hang onm love, to the memories of those happy years
Red lights are flashing around me
Good Lord it looks like they found me

[Chorus]
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
I wish I had you, to talk to
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
"This is the police. You are surrounded
Give yourself up."
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
"This is the police. You are surrounded
Give yourself up."
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
"This is the police. You are surrounded
Give yourself up."
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord I can't go back thereEmbed
