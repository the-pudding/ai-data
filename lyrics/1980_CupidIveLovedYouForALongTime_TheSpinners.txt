2 ContributorsCupid (Iâ€™ve Loved You For A Long Time) LyricsCupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now, I don't mean to bother you, but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losin' all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix
So Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now Cupid, if your arrow make a love storm for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us, her heart we can steal
Help me if you will
So Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Don't you hear me callin'
My tears keep fallin'
I gotta have a lot of nana
Cupid, cupid
Look I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
I look at you
You turn away
I say to you
Please look my way
But you say to me
Leave it alone
And I say
I can't live without you
Hey, I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
Girl didn't you know that
My love's is for you
And it hurts me so bad
I'm telling you
Come on look at you want
Try it again
Can't you see I can't live without you
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
Make you my baby
Cupid
Draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Hear me callin'
Hear the love's getting stronger
All I got to do is callin' louder
