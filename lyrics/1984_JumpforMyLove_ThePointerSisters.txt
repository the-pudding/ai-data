18 ContributorsJump (For My Love) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your eyes, tell me how you want me
I can feel it in your heartbeat
I know you like what you see
Hold me, I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll take you down, I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more
If you want more, more, more

[Chorus]
Then jump, for my love
Jump in, and feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, jump, for my love
Jump, I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in, you know these arms can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, jump, for my love

[Verse 2]
You told me, I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do
Then make a move before you try
And go much farther, oh baby
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You are the one, you are the one
And heaven waits here at my door
And if you want more
If you want more, more, more

[Chorus]
Then jump, for my love
Jump in, and feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, jump, for my love
Jump, I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in, you know these arms can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, jump, for my love

[Bridge]
When you are next to me, oh, I come alive
Your love burns inside
Feels so right
Come to me if you want me tonight, jump

[Chorus]
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, you know my heart can make you happy
Jump, you know these arms can feel you up
Jump in, you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump, jump, for my love
[Outro]
Jump, come on, and jump on in
Jump, you know I need you
Jump in, I got to have you, yeah
Jump, jump, for my love
Got to have you
Jump, yeah, yeah
Jump, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Jump in, hey yeah, come on and jump
Jump, jump, for my love, oh, oh yeah
Jump, ooh ooh
Jump, oh baby
Jump in, yeah, ooh yeah
Jump in, come on in
Jump, jump, for my love
