7 ContributorsBreakin’... There’s No Stopping Us Lyrics[Intro]
Do it
Hold on

[Verse 1]
Out in the street, you don't survive by being weak
This is our time, walls were made for us to climb
Don't you try to lock us out
'Cause we're breakin' down the doors
And all we're prepared to fight
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it better (No one does it better)
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
Really doesn't matter

[Interlude]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Long overdue
No playin' game or being used
Something to prove
It's more than just a dream come true
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
We have waited far too long
For this moment to arrive
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it better (No one does it better)
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
Really doesn't matter
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it better (No one does it better than me and you)
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
Really doesn't matter

[Bridge]
Do it
Do it
Do it
Breakdance
Do it
Can you breakdance?

[Pre-Chorus]
We have waited for too long
For this moment to arrive
Hey, hey
[Chorus]
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it better (No one does it better)
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
Really doesn't matter
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it betterEmbed
