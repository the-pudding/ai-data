Lift me, won't you lift me
Above the old routine?
Make it nice, play it clean, jazzman

[Verse 1]
When the jazzman's testifyin'
A faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise
Or bring you to your knees
It's a gospel kind of feelin'
A touch of Georgia slide
A song of pure revival
And a style that's sanctified

[Chorus]
Jazzman, take my blues away
Make my pain the same as yours
With every change you play
Jazzman, oh jazzman

[Verse 2]
When the jazzman's signifyin'
And the band is windin' low
It's the late night side of mornin'
In the darkness of his soul
He can fill a room with sadness
As he fills his horn with tears
He can cry like a fallen angel
When risin' time is near
You might also like[Chorus]
Jazzman, take my blues away
Make my pain the same as yours
With every change you play

[Outro]
Oh lift me, won't you lift me
With every turnaround?
Play it sweetly, take me down, oh jazzmanEmbed
