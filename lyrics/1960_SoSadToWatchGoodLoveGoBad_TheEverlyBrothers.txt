10 ContributorsSo Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad) Lyrics[Verse 1]
We used to have good times together
But now I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad

[Verse 2]
Remember how you used to feel, dear?
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad

[Bridge]
Is it any wonder that I feel so blue
When I know for certain that I'm losing you?

[Verse 2]
Remember how you used to feel, dear?
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad

[Outro]
