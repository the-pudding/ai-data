If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me

[Verse 1]
All the things
That we've been through
You should understand me
Like I understand you

[Verse 2]
Now, baby, I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothin'
To upset our happy home

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, don't get so excited
When I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight

[Chorus]
(If you don't know me by now)
If you don't know me by now
(You will never, never, never know me)
You will never, never, never know me
(If you don't know me by now)
If you don't know me, baby
(You will never, never, never know me)
No, you won't
You might also like[Verse 3]
We've all got
Our own funny moods
I've got mine
Woman, you've got yours too

[Verse 4]
Just trust in me
Like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
That should be so easy to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When we can't see eye to eye

[Chorus]
(If you don't know me by now)
If you don't, if you don't know me, baby
(You will never, never, never know me)
(If you don't know me by now)
If you don't know me by now
(You will never, never, never know me)
No, you won't
(If you don't know me by now)
(You will never, never, never know me)
(If you don't know me by now)
(You will never, never, never know me)1Embed
