21 ContributorsObsession Lyrics[Verse 1]
You are an obsession
You are an obsession
I cannot sleep
I cannot sleep
I am a possession
I am your possession
Unopened at your feet
There's no balance
There is no balance
No equality
No equality
Be still
Be still
I will not accept defeat
I will not accept defeat

[Pre-Chorus]
I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way
And I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you
And capture you
You might also like[Chorus]
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?

[Verse 2]
I feed you, I drink you
By day and by night
I need you, I need you
By sun or candlelight
You protest
You want to leave!
Stay
Oh! There's no alternative
There's no alternative

[Pre-Chorus]
Your face appears again
I see the beauty there
But I see danger
Stranger, beware
Of circumstance
In your naked dreams
Your affection
Is not what it seems
[Chorus]
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?

[Verse 3]
My fantasy
My fantasy
Has turned to madness
Has turned to madness
And all my goodness
And all my goodness
Has turned to badness
Has turned to badness
My need to possess you
Has consumed my soul
My life is trembling
I have no control

[Pre-Chorus]
I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way
And I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you
And capture you
[Chorus]
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?

[Outro]
You are an obsession
You're my obsession4Embed
