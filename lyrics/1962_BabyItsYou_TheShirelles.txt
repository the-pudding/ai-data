Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la

[Verse 1]
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart (Sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart

[Chorus]
Woh oh oh, many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
I can't help myself
'Cause baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la)
(Sha la la la la)

[Verse 2]
You should hear what they say about you, "cheat," "cheat."
They say, they say you never never never  been true (Cheat cheat)

[Chorus]
Uh oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
I don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)
