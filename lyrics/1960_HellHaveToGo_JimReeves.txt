8 ContributorsHeâ€™ll Have to Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

[Verse 2]
Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Though love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

[Bridge]
You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man
Do you want me? Answer yes or no
Darling, I will understand

[Verse 1]
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to goYou might also likeEmbed
