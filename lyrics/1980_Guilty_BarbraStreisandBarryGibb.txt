10 ContributorsGuilty Lyrics[Verse 1: Barbra Streisand]
Shadows falling, baby, we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet
Got a heartache of their own (It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad (It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're livin' on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's got to be night and day
Just a matter of time

[Chorus: Barbra Streisand]
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Pulses racing, darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark (It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be out in the cold (It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're buildin' on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time

And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye

[Bridge: Barbra Streisand & Barry Gibb]
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
I don't wanna hear your

[Chorus: Barbra Streisand & Barry Gibb]
And we got nothing
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end2Embed
