5 ContributorsI Canâ€™t Wait Another Minute Lyrics[Spoken Intro:]
You know
I've been waiting so long for this chance
Can we talk alone?

But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute

[Verse 1:]
Little lady
You look so fine
Can't turn my eyes away
So much I wanna say
And tonight I wanna make you mine

We'll turn the lights down low
And dance so very slow
I know that we don't know each other well
But I can't believe I'm wasting your time

Oh, no
So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight

[Chorus:]
'Cuz I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute
You might also like'Cuz I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real
'Cuz I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute for your love

Your love
No
No, no, baby

[Verse 2:]
Sweet lady
Don't you look away
I don't mean to make you shy
But we haven't got much time

Tonight, I know just what to say, yeah
I'll love your cares away
And you and I will find a way

You know that there's a possibility
That we'll never get this chance once again
Oh, no

So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight
Baby, tonight
[Chorus:]
'Cuz I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute

'Cuz I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real
'Cuz I can't wait another minute (No I can't)
I can't wait another minute for your love

Your love
Oh, yeah

[Bridge:]
I know that we don't know each other well
But I can't believe I'm wasting your time
Oh, no
So tell me what to do for the love of you
Tonight
Tonight, baby

[Chorus:]
'Cuz I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute
'Cuz I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real
'Cuz I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute for your love

Don't make me wait another minute
Oh no, baby
For your loveEmbed
