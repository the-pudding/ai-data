27 ContributorsSt. Elmoâ€™s Fire (Man in Motion) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Growin' up
You don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by
Movin' straight ahead, you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone, everything has changed

[Verse 2]
Play the game
You know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on
Only you can do what must be done
You know in some way you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner
And you're trying to break free

[Chorus]
I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You might also like[Verse 3]
Burnin' up
Don't know just how far that I can go (Just how far I go)
Soon be home
Only just a few miles down the road
I can make it, I know I can
You broke the boy in me
But you won't break the man

[Chorus]
I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire

[Post-Chorus]
I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me
Burnin' in me

[Bridge]
Just once in his life, a man has his time
And my time is now, I'm coming alive
[Chorus]
I can hear the music playin'
I can see the banners fly
Feel like a man again, I'll hold my head high
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire
I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire

[Outro]
I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me
Burnin'
Burnin' in me
I can feel it burnin'
Ooh, burnin' inside of me4Embed
