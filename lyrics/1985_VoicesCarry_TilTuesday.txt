I'm in the dark, I'd like to read his mind
But I'm frightened of the things I might find
There must be something he's thinking of to tear him away
When I tell him that I'm falling in love, why does he say

[Chorus]
Hush hush, keep it down now
Voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now
Voices carry

[Verse 2]
I try so hard not to get upset
Because I know all the trouble I'll get
Oh, he tells me tears are something to hide and something to fear
And I try so hard to keep it inside so no one can hear

[Chorus]
Hush hush, keep it down now
Voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now
Voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now
Voices carry

Oh, he wants me
But only part of the time
He wants me
If he can keep me in line

[Chorus]
Hush hush, keep it down now
Voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now
Voices carry

[Outro]
Oh, hush hush, shut up now
Voices carry
Oh, hush hush, keep it down now
Voices carry
Oh, hush hush, darling, she might overhear
Voices carry
Oh no
Voices carry
Hush hush, he said shut up, he said shut up
Voices carry
Oh God can't you keep it down?
Voices carry
Hush hush
Voices carry
I wish he would let me talk4Embed
