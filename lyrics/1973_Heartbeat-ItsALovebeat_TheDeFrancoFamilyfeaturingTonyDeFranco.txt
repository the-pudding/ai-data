5 ContributorsHeartbeat, Itâ€™s a Lovebeat LyricsGirl, when I'm alone with you
I get a feeling through and through
Telling me that love is coming on

My head starts spinning round and round
And I don't care what's up or down
'Cause deep in my soul
I'm out of control
When I start to hear the sound of

A heartbeat
It's a lovebeat
And a lovebeat is a good vibration
Oh, a heartbeat is a lovebeat
And when we meet
It's a good sensation

Listen to my heart pound
Listen to my love sound
Feel it getting stronger
Can't hold back any longer

Heartbeat
It's a lovebeat
And a lovebeat is a good vibration
Oh, a heartbeat it's a lovebeat
And when we meet
It's a good sensation

Like a vision in disguise
Tryin' to explain the way I feel

And there's a movement in my mind
Like a rhythm counting time
Breaking down all my defenses
Overcoming all of my senses

Heartbeat
It's a lovebeat
And a lovebeat is a good vibration
Oh, a heartbeat it's a lovebeat
And when we meet
It's a good sensation

Listen to my heart pound
Listen to my love sound
Temperature is rising
Girl, there's no disguising

Heartbeat
It's a lovebeat
And a lovebeat is a good vibration
Oh, a heartbeat it's a lovebeat
And when we meet
It's a good sensationEmbed
