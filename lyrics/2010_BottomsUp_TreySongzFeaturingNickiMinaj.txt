Yeah, come here (Kane is in the building, nigga)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, ay) It's Mr. Steal Yo Girl
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, ay) It's Mr. Steal Yo Girl
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Hey girl, hey girl
(Oh-oh-oh) hey girl, hey girl
Leggo

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Bottoms up, bottoms up, ayy, what's in ya cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw your hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw ya hands up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up, up, up

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
You know what it is, girl, we back up in this thang
Money stay in my pocket, girl, I'm like a walkin' bank
Tell me whatcha drank, tell me whatcha thank
If I go get these bottles, we go alcohol insane

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Callin' all the girls, do you hear me?
All around the world, city to city
Cheers to the girls, throw a deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
Gettin' loose in the ride
Hatin' ass nigga you can move to the, move to the, move to the side

Bottoms up, bottoms up, ayy, what's in ya cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw your hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw ya hands up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up, up, up

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
My vision's blurred (Come here), my words slurred (Come here)
It's jam-packed (Yeah), a million girls (Hey)
And I ain't tryna leave, though
We drunk so let me be your alcohol hero

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Callin' all the girls (Girls), do you hear me? (Girls)
All around the world, city to city (Yeah)
Cheers to the girls, throw a deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
Gettin' loose in the ride
Hatin' ass nigga you can move to the move to the move to the side

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Nicki Minaj]
Bottoms up, bottoms up, ayy, what's in ya cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw your hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up (Uh-huh), throw ya hands up (Uh)
Bottoms up, bottoms up (Uh), bottoms up, up, up (Yo)
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Could I get that 'trón? Could I get that Remy?
Could I get that Coke? Could I get that Henny?
Could I get that margarita on the rock-rock-rocks?
Could I get that salt all around that rim, rim, rim, rim?
Trey, I was like, "Yo, Trey
Do you think you could buy me a bottle of Rosé?"
Okay, let's get it now
I'm with a bad bitch, he's with his friends
I don't say, "Hi", I say, "Keys to the Benz"
Keys to the Benz? Keys to the Benz
Motherfuckin' right, yeah, V to the 10
If a bitch tryna get cute I'ma stomp her
Throw a lot of money at her then yell, "Fuck her! Fuck her! Fuck her!"
Then yell, "Fuck her!"
Then I'ma go get my Louisville Slugger
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm really such a lady
I rep Young Money, you know, Slim, Baby?
And we be doing donuts while we wavin' the .380
We give a lot of money to the babies out in Haiti
Yellin', "All around the world
Do you hear me?", "Do you like my body? Anna Nicki"
Rest in peace to Anna Nicole Smith
Yes, my dear, you're so explosive
Say, "Hi" to Mary, Mary and Joseph
Now, bottoms up and double my dosage
[Chorus: Trey Songz & Nicki Minaj]
Bottoms up, bottoms up, ayy, what's in ya cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw your hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm on that
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw ya hands up (I'm beat)
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up, up, up
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm good, I'm good

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Trey Songz]
Trigga Trey, Nicki M., let's get it
Bottoms up (Come here!), bottoms up, bottoms up
I-I-I-I I am Zolanski (Bottoms up)
I'm Roman (Bottoms up)
