Son of a gun

[Verse 1]
You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror, as you watched yourself gavotte

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner and

[Chorus]
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

[Verse 2]
You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee and

[Chorus]
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you?

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee and

[Chorus]
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

[Verse 3]
Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not
[Pre-Chorus]
You're with some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend and

[Chorus]
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you now?

[Outro]
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you18Embed
