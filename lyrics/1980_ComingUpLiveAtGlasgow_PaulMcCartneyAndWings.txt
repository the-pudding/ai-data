9 ContributorsComing Up (Live at Glasgow) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away
I want to help you with your problem
Stick around, I say

[Chorus]
It's coming up
It's coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up
Yeah, you got it!

[Verse 2]
You want a friend you can rely on
One who will never fade away
I know you're searching for an answer
Stick around, I say

[Chorus]
It's coming up, yeah
It's coming up
Coming up, on the hour
Coming up, yeah
I like it
You might also like[Verse 3]
You want some peace and understanding
So everybody can be free
I know that we can get together
We hear music endlessly

[Chorus]
It's coming up
It's coming up, yeah
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, oh I can dig it
Yeah get down, get down

[Verse 4]
You want a better kind of future
One that everyone can share
You're not alone, we all could use it
Stick around, we're nearly there

[Chorus]
It's coming up, yeah
It's coming up, alright
Coming up like a flower
Coming up
Oh clap your hands come on
Clap your hand
[Verse 1]
You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away
I'd like to help you with your problem
Stick around, pretty baby I say
