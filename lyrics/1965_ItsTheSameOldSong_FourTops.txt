You're sweet (You're sweet) as a honeybee
But like a honeybee stings, you've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left (All you left) is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories (Sweet memories)
Of a tender love that used to be

[Chorus]
Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
Now it's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning (Since you've been gone)
And it breaks me up to hear it
I, oh, I

[Verse 2]
A sentimental fool (Sweet, sweet memories) am I
To hear an old love song and wanna cry
But the melody (Sweet, sweet memories) keeps calling me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
I keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts
Saying, "Together forever, (Darling) breaking up never"

[Chorus]
(It's the same old song) Can't bear to hear it
(With a different meaning since you've been gone) Since you've been gone, oh, it hurts to hear it
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone

Precious memories (Sweet, sweet memories) keep lingering on
Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone (Sweet, sweet memories), there's this emptiness
I only reminisce the happiness we spent
We used to dance to the music (We used to dance to the music)
Make romance to the music (Make romance to the music)

[Chorus]
Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
Now it's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
I, oh, I can't bear to hear it

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
Oooh, it breaks me up to hear it
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning (Since you've been gone)
Oh, can't bear to hear it

It's the same old songEmbed
