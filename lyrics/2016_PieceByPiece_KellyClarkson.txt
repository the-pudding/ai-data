30 ContributorsPiece by Piece Lyrics[Verse 1]
And all I remember is your back
Walkin' towards the airport, leavin' us all in your past
I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
Begged you to want me, but you didn't want to (Ah)

[Chorus]
But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old
And you know
He never walks away, he never asks for money
He takes care of me, he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could
Stay

[Verse 2]
And all of your words fall flat
I made somethin' of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn't free, it has to be earned (Ah)
Back then I didnâ€™t have anything you needed, so I was worthless (Ah)

[Chorus]
But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old
And you know
He never walks away, he never asks for money
He takes care of me, 'cause he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

[Chorus]
Piece by piece, I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you, I'm gonna put her first
And you know
He'll never walk away, he'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things, he'll love her
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great
