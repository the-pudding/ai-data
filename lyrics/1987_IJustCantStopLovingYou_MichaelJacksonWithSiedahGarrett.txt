I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
You might also like[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I doEmbed
