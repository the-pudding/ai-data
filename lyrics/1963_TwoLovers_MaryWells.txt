Well, I've got two lovers
And I ain't ashamed
Two lovers
And I love them both the same

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout my first lover
He's sweet and kind
And he's mine, oh, mine
And treats me good like a lover should
And makes me love him

[Pre-Chorus]
I really, really love him
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
I love him so (Love him so)
And I'll do everything I can to let him know

[Chorus]
But, I've got two lovers
And I ain't ashamed
Two lovers
And I love them both the same

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you 'bout my other lover
Well, you know he treats me bad
Makes me sad
Makes me cry, but still I can't deny
That I love him
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I really, really love him
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
I love him so (Love him so)
And I'll do everything I can to let him know

[Bridge]
Darling, well
Don't you know that I can tell
Whenever I look at you
That you think that I'm untrue
'Cause I say that I love two
But, I really, really do

'Cause you're a split personality (Split personality)
And in reality (And in reality)
Both of them are you (They both are you)
Baby (Baby, ooh)

[Chorus]
Well, I've got two lovers
And I ain't ashamed
Two lovers
And I love them both the same

Two lovers
And I ain't ashamed
Two lovers
And I love them both the same1Embed
