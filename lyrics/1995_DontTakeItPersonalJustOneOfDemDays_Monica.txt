It's just one of dem days when I wanna be all alone
It's just one of dem days when I gotta be all alone
It's just one of dem days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone, and you think I treat you wrong

[Verse 1]
I wanna take some time out to think things through
I know it always feels like I'm doing you wrong
But I'm so in love with you
So understand that I'm only in love
You're the only one I need
So have no thought that I want to leave
And baby, trust me please

[Chorus]
Just one of dem days
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't wanna take it out on you
Just one of dem days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal
Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't take it personal

I sit and I think about every thing we do
And I find myself in misery and that ain't cool
Hey now, I really wanna be with you the whole way through
'Cause the way you make me feel inside keeps me confused
As I swing back mood to mood, it's not because of you
I never want you to be insecure
So won't you understand that I'm only in love?
You're the only one I need
I'll be there for you when you need me, boy
So baby, don't you leave

[Chorus]
Just one of dem days
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't wanna take it out on you
Just one of dem days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Just one of dem days (Just one of dem days)
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
I don't wanna take it out on you
Just one of dem days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't take it personal
[Bridge]
(Don't take it personal) Just one of dem days, yeah
Don't take it personal
Just one of dem days
Just one of dem days a girls goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't wanna take it out on you

[Chorus]
Just one of dem days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal, baby (Just one of dem days)
Personal, baby
When I'm angry inside (Personal, baby)
Personal, baby
Just one of dem days (Personal, baby)
Personal, baby
I just wanna be all alone (Personal, baby)
And you think I treat you wrong (Personal, baby)

[Outro]
