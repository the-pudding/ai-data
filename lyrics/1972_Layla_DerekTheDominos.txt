[Verse 1]
What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been runnin' and hidin' much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

[Chorus]
Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

[Verse 2]
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
It turned my whole world upside down

[Chorus]
Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
You might also like[Verse 3]
So make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please, don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain

[Chorus]
Layla
You've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla
I'm begging, darling, please
Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
