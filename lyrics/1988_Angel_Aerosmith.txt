27 ContributorsAngel Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the cryin' that I do is for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light

[Chorus]
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone

You're my angel

[Bridge]
You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight (Angel)
You're my angel
Come and take me, alright

[Outro]
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight10Embed
