5 ContributorsCan’t You Hear My Heartbeat LyricsEvery time I see you lookin' my way
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
In the car or walking down the highway
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

When you move up closer to me
I get a feelin' that's ooh-wee (ah)
Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat
'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love

When I feel you put your arms around me
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Then I'm glad, I'm mighty glad I found you
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

When you asked me to meet your ma
I knew that, baby, we'd be going far (ah)
Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?
'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love

All my friends are cryin' out to meet you
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Now's the time to go and see the preacher
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

Baby baby, you're gonna be mine (ah)
Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat
'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love

Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?
Baby baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?Embed
