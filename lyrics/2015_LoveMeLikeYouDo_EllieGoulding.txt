[Verse 1]
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

[Verse 2]
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

[Chorus]
So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 3]
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinkin' straight
My head's spinnin' around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Yeah)
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinkin' straight
My head's spinnin' around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Yeah, yeah)
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do (Woah)
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do (Ah)
What are you waiting for?
