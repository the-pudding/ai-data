Hee-hee, ooh
Go on, girl, aaow!
Hee

[Verse 1]
Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)
Uh, uh

[Verse 2]
I like this feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
You might also like[Chorus]
The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now, baby (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)

[Interlude]
Acha-ooh
Go on, girl, go on
Hee-hee, aaow
Go on, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now, baby, hee (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone, ah, ah (My lonely days are gone)
The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now, baby, hee (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)
[Bridge]
Ain't nobody's business (The way you make me feel)
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business (You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby, hee-hee (You knock me off of my feet)
Hee-hee, ooh (My lonely days are gone)
Give it to me (The way you make me feel)
Give me some time
Come on, be my girl (You really turn me on)
I wanna be with mine
Ain't nobody's business (You knock me off of my feet)
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby (My lonely days are gone)
Go on, girl, aaow

Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby (My lonely days are gone)
Go on, girl
Give it to me (The way you make me feel)
Give me some time
