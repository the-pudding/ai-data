It felt like springtime
On this February morning
In a courtyard
Birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said
To make me feel all right
I carry them with me today now

[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy

[Verse 2]
I wonder why
I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy-hearted
'Til you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I want to meet you barefoot
Barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

Oh, darling
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

[Bridge]
It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why (ooh la kah koh)

[Outro]
Mmm, the sun comes out again (ooh la kah koh)
When the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out
Oh, the sun comes out again
When the sun comes outEmbed
