[Verse 1]
There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
There's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

[Chorus]
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Then slowly turn away from me

[Verse 2]
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echoes say we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light
You might also like[Chorus]
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning angel
Then slowly turn away, I won't beg you to stay with me

[Bridge]
Through the tears
Of the day
Of the years
Baby!

[Chorus]
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling10Embed
