1 ContributorChip Chip Lyrics[Verse 1]
From one little kiss and a lotta lovin'
You build a big mansion of love
High on a hill of happiness
With someone that you've been dreamin' of

[Verse 2]
You build a wall all around with a lotta lovin'
All around your mansion of love
Then one day you'll hear a strange little sound
Tryin' to tear your mansion down

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, ho, hoo, oh
Chip, chip, you tell a little lie
Chip, chip, you make your baby cry
Chip, chip, you cheat a little bit
Chip, chip, you quarrel over it

[Chorus]
Woah, ho, hoo, oh
One day you're gonna discover
One little wrong leads to another
Chip, chip, a-chippin' away
Chippin' at your mansion of love
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
A-one little spark when it starts to glowin'
Can warm a big mansion of love
One little wrong brings on the gloom
Puts a chill in every room

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, ho, hoo, oh
Chip, chip, you tell a little lie
Chip, chip, you make your baby cry
Chip, chip, you cheat a little bit
Chip, chip, you quarrel over it

[Chorus]
Woah, ho, hoo, oh
One day you're gonna discover
One little wrong leads to another
Chip, chip, a-chippin' away
Chippin' at your mansion of love

[Outro]
Chip, chip, a-chippin' away
Chippin' at your mansion of love
Chip, chip, a-chippin' away
Chippin' at your mansion of love
Chip, chip, chippin' away
Chippin' at your mansion of love
Chip, chipEmbed
