51 ContributorsBills, Bills, Bills Lyrics[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
At first, we started out real cool
Takin' me places I ain't never been
But now, you're gettin' comfortable
Ain't doin' those things you did no more
You're slowly makin' me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car (Car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me and
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
You triflin', good-for-nothin' type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

[Chorus: All & Beyoncé]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Bills)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills? (Bills)
Can you pay my telephone bills? (Bills)
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Bills)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (Do, do, do, do)
So, you and me are through (Through)

Now you've been maxing out my cards (Card)
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But you're steady headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees
Perpetratin' to your friends like you be ballin'
And then you use my cellphone (Phone)
Callin' whoever that you think's at home
And then, when the bill comes
All of a sudden, you be actin' dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than once

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
You triflin', good-for-nothin' type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

[Chorus: All & Beyoncé]
Can you pay my bills? (Pay the bills)
Can you pay my telephone bills? (Pay my telephone bills)
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Pay my bill)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (I don't think you do)
So, you and me are through (You and me are through)
Can you pay my bills? (Bills)
Can you pay my telephone bills? (Bills)
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Bills)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (Oh no, no, no, no)
So, you and me are through (You and me are through, through)
[Bridge: All & Beyoncé]
You triflin', good-for-nothin' type of brother (Good for nothin')
Oh, silly me, why haven't I found another? (Found another)
You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Hey)
Oh, silly me, why haven't I found another? (Oh, woah)
You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Oh, no, no)
Oh, silly me, why haven't I found another? (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
You triflin', good-for-nothin' type of brother (Good for nothing)
Oh, silly me, why haven't I found another?

[Chorus: All]
Can you pay my bills? (Can you pay the bills)
Can you pay my telephone bills? (Can you pay my telephone bills?)
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Do you pay my automo' bill?)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (Think you do)
So, you and me are through (So you and me are through)
Can you pay my bills? (Pay my bills)
Can you pay my telephone bills? (Pay my bills)
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Telephone bill)
If you did, then maybe we could chill (Pay my bills)
I don't think you do (I don't think you do)
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills? (Bill)
Can you pay my telephone bills? (Bills)
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Bills)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (Don't think you do)
So, you and me are through (You and me are through)
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Bills)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
