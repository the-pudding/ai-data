3 ContributorsDizaster vs Arsonal (2013) Lyrics[Round 1: Arsonal]
I said, Toronto! What's up? It feels good to be back here
I had to make my return after killing Patrick last year
Now Bachir what I gotta bash here?
Y'all know me, I'm hands on when I check pussy
First round gon' be the pap smear
Diz' you got lyrical talent, but I'm not a fan
In battle you a vet but I can't respect your kind of man
You was KOTD champ, you was life, you had a lot of fans
You lost and said fuck them for URL, you wildin' fam
Now you trying to regain respect?
But you not a man
You more of a disgrace to them then to the Taliban
You a cocky tatted aggressor, you a yeller when you rap
You tried Smack now you came back and you catching these Clips
Nigga you Hollohan
You lost to a rapper that purchase bars, that's insane
Me, I got a hustler mentality, I will flip 'Cane
Mention my Crip gang, fifth bang 'til my wrist sprain
I'll fire and Diz' hire, Tina Marie and Rick James
Fire and desire? The only reason I mentioned Rick James is cause y'all both artist who die from trying to get 'Cane
Purple flag where my clip hang, fry ya membrane
Ya Earth the third rock-ed after ya son/sun get that big bang
Bachir's no Dizaster, I could see he styling
He not a G he play gangsta that's an easy talent
Well my heat be wildin', when he freestyling
One bow, one bang bang! Waka/Chief Keef album
And nah, I ain't buying that liar shit that  you selling
You over act so they thinking it's a fire pit that you dwell in
But deep down you's a soft soul you Dr. Scholls, you be gelling
I'm a product of desecration I'm an educated felon
All that yelling won't shake up a nigga that never rattle
I'm a bred brunching for big beef, he small cattle
Got a wide nose cannon aiming at you
Shooting for an hour straight like the camera man at ya DNA battle
Speaking of battles
Our last battle your body bag for sure
A definite (death in it), ya first round was trash
I whooped ya ass for the hell of it
Cali felt you was losing, so they cancelled the rest of it
The west had to interrupt, why?
Cause every bar that I tell is swift
The West, interrupt, Taylor Swift?
Canada y'all smell me on that? Is y'all inhaling this?
Canada y'all smell me on that? Is y'all inhaling this?
One word to describe this crime scene, ya Alias
Dizaster, please tell me the price of a brick right now, pure coke
Please just give me a round amount
Oh yeah, you not a trapper, you an actor
Nigga what you getting loud about?
You not even an actor you a rapper, but on wax you never sound it out
You only good for about 4 bars an acappella freestyle
You Conceited on Wild N' Out
I said I got a DE cause I'm a G but RA D Eagle spray you
I got a DE cause I'm a G RADE, DEGRADE you
See first way I spit see it really didn't faze you
But every bar I spit, kick, I gotta Sonya Blade you
I made you and these Grape Street Crip niggas raised you
If 6 clap, then 6 pack nigga muscles around ya naval
We tussle around I'm able to let everybody put they hands on you nigga
You like a spade shuffle around a table
Bars after bars after bars that's all you heard from me
I put bar after bar like I architected Bourbon Street
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
And you can't spell "bars" without putting that "Ars" in it
You might also like[Round 1: Dizaster]
You came up here wearing red, who the fuck designs your stuff?
Are you a Grape Street cat or some kind of Blood?
I said I wouldn't freestyle for once, I lied
I said I been writing for months but fucking Charron knows
Ain't no freestylers like us, ayo Charron I'm a freestyle-
Psyche! I don't freestyle with no cunts
I'm glad you took this trip to expose me
Cause I only took this trip to embarrass ya
Oh yeah today we gon' talk a lot about the bitch in ya character
So today everybody welcome the fakest Crip in America
And he always wanna throw his C's up
When he's far away from any beef that can make him freeze up
Last time he was in LA he wasn't acting too G'd up
The same purple flag he always flashing was in the back of his jeans tucked
It's what I'm saying though, see he does it in Canada
Yeah he does it in Canada
Yeah this motherfucker ain't on the block, that shows you he ain't Grape
He been in Canada more times than he's been to Watts
How is this fool a fucking G?
How is this fool a G?
He always refer to the yapping about how his burners be clapping
And how he has all these murder contraptions
But when will we see these words turn into actions?
It's like every time you get in the spotlight you get this allergic reaction
You keeping it real in ya verse when you're rapping?
Every time 'bout how your thang be blasting and how ya gang be smashing
The way he rap you would think he some type of trained assassin
No, he's a fake geek rapping, false Grape Street flagging
Mainstream acting, male battle rapper that looks like Tracy Chapman
How we gon' play this captain?
Ya face gets slapped so fast everybody in Toronto will get the delayed reaction
Your brain plummets and your frame collapses
Arcane's stomach will even feel the pain from it
That's what I call a chain reaction
Y'all remember him from the all the blockbuster stories and theaters
And that one movie, I didn't even like his performance either
He was that one horrible slimy looking foreign creature
That ended up having a baby with Sigourney Weaver
He's known as the most viewed in the world, he's known as a leader
But he's also known for being an MC with the most phony demeanor
Even more than Arcane even though he got exposed as a cheater
Because he weaseled his way to the title, same way he stole it from Peter
But I'll get my chain back Toronto and I ain't have to go back for it either
I'll just tell Pat, "Stay...now go fetch it for me like a fucking Golden Retriever!"
Ain't no reason to further delay this shit
I'ma make a verbal statement quick
When we first battled in the Bay
He told me he'll run in my mosque and return with a bacon strip
Those are the words you gon' say?
If you would've went any further that day
That verse would have made me sick
This is how it would've turned up
I would've germinated the Earth with you like a turnip
I would've terminated this Crip
I'll beat you in your spine steadily 'til your vertebrae curves and then it slips
Why step to me?
This discetomy will give you a herniated disc
I give a fuck if you were from the highest murder rate exists
I'll strangle your throat 'til your blood circulation restricts
And you start looking like you did on stage in Detroit
When you developed that gay nervous little twitch
I plant you feet first in the pavement like this
Pull your face away vertical with a crane that lifts you away
Have you ever seen a person's face get stretched?
I'll pull your eyes so far back in ya head
You'll literally turn into an Asian bitch
You look like Waka Flocka all day, these jeans all gay
Wardrobe belongs to Kanye, face screaming "Give me back the Wale!"
[Round 2: Arsonal]
2010, Hitman vs. Ars', that was a main classic
But for y'all to see where this shit going, y'all gon' need glasses
Cause since that day, you The Saurus, Illmac', Okwerdz
All y'all geek asses instantly became a thing of the past/pass; a bunch of Steve Nash's
Now somebody please tell Da Don that I don't do rematches
I guess I lied to his face like I did to DNA
Before I smoked his father cheap ashes
To you battle rap like the NBA on Dish, cheap access to watch
But besides King Of The Dot, every other league passes
I'm awkward, I'm left handed, but I learned to write and read backwards
You a internet pedophile, probably part of a teen catfish
MIB memory loss, soon as he see flashes
Let me wipe the sweat off my forehead and begin to clean glasses
Nah let's keep it real, y'all wanna see tragic?
How about I use a Calico to make him Diz'/dis-appear that'll be/B Magic
I'm in your bitch ocean swimming with Marine tactics
I ain't gotta fuck on ya bed I'd rather bean bag it
I'm on a mission, 2 targets, 3 ratchets
How y'all expect me to put my A game against a D average?
My [?] I pull slow, I leave 'em ripped with a stitched upper torso
Have Diz' looking like a True Religion jean jacket
My talent, my skill is real, it's undenying
But it's in ya Nature Boy, you Ric Flair when it come to lying
You say you put the metal to niggas jeans, let off that steam
No one's denying, but then you pour the water out the top
Cause you literally dump your iron
You Malcolm X with the lies when you rhyme it's By Any Means Necessary
But that's your rap image you live if you put your real life secondary
How I live you could catch a slug from a secretary
That keep a loaded fifth, Diz' ya guns don't exist
They like the 30th of February
Now you say you beat Shotty Horroh...bitch, no you didn't
You said you beat DNA....bitch no you didn't
You even said you beat Crome...and you lost to him the worst
He had so much dirt on your stupid ass I had to put some in this verse
How what I did to Crome was bad, but when you battled Crome I laughed
Cause honestly Crome is trash, Diz' how'd he expose your ass?
He had everything from text messages, sex messages
Pornographic photographs, a note attached to a bottle of water
Like drink this with your thirsty ass
Let me ask you this, would you let the bitch he sent to you
Blind fold you and have your hands tied?
Would you fly standby with the bitch
Knowing the plane gon' land in a field full of landmines?
Would you put it in your mouth and suck the blood off her tampon?
No? So why you let that pussy nigga send a bitch to do a man's job?
Nigga I'm street smart and book smart
Bachir, you don't even look smart
In a game of chess, would you sacrifice your queen to let your rook walk?
All you wanna do is battle
Nigga I got two deals on the table, that's the good part
So even when this chapter close
I'ma be in between paper like a bookmark
Nigga you wouldn't hurt a fly, you wouldn't throw a jab at a hook bar
You fear altercation, that's why hate to drive a cab with a push start
We bang, we throw it up, nigga Grape Street, sign language
That's how crooks talk
Nigga yo bars stink, worse than a Shotgun Suge fart
Now stop bitching bitch nigga and rap
What? You think cause I flew here that I ain't got a Smith'n to clap?
Well the pilot my biggest customer, I give him the strap
He meet me at baggage claim when I land that's when he give me it back
Nigga I'm here to snatch every bit of confidence from your conscience
Since you trying to convince Canada of your accomplishments
I'm your consequence, my defense, I kill him with kindness
In reconasense
Now that 40 start to smoke and no marijuana stench
You gotta crawl before you walk, so taking Ars' that was a big step
King Of The Dot, Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is
Or you gon' get your chin checked
See I give credit when it's due, your flow bankrupt, in debt
But now that we in the T, D, they banking on a quick death
Bars after bars after bars, all you heard from me
I put bar after bar like I architected Bourbon Street
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
And you can't spell "bars" without putting that "Ars" in it
[Round 2: Dizaster]
Aight you wanna play this "I know which bitch you fucked shit" cool
I'm sorry Mystique I wasn't gonna bring this up I love you
So you wanna talk shit about the sweetish shit bitch, cool
I'm glad you wanted to bring it up, look at her
She's all fucking giggling it up
Cause this dude brown nosed her for 120 minutes and he didn't fuck
Real fucking shit, you sniffed her butt, you licked it up
Ray Swag looking at you like "That bitch what's up?"
You fucked up, give it up
How does it feel to know you put your tongue where Uno Lavoz used to hang his dick and nuts
It don't matter where he put his tongue, he tongued 'em both
It's funny that Uno Lavoz came before him
Because he ended up becoming the butt of a joke
That's hella funny bro
This fool's such a fucking pussy, yes I swear to god, she standing right there
How are you gonna say that it didn't happen bro?
After a week stay you fucking came back to your girl
And you made out with her, Lady Arsonal, yeah
You wanna betray the one that loves you the most
You ain't a fucking man, you a supreme snake
You ain't two faced, you three faced, any bitch that with you
Can find another dude to be with off Ebay
This dude drove down Mystique's Hershey highway like it was an open freeway
Then came back to his girl after a week's stay and kissed her
But when she makes out with him does she understand that
Pieces of feces can at least stay in your mouth for up to three days
Before they decay, do you know what that means A'?
That means every time you and your girl kiss you
You, her and Mystique are having an ass to mouth three way
His shit is real, his shit is raw, his shit is authentic
And you can't spell eating "Arse" without putting the "Ars'" in it
Talking shit, he be walking around for like a year
With her asshole stuck to his bottom lip
Which makes a lot of sense
Cause recently in all the blogs he did he's been talking a lot of shit
And after that we gon' fuck where ya mom at
And I'ma roll up and take a shit where ya lawn at
Before I fuck your bitch I'ma cover up and get my cock wrapped
Cause whatever she got I don't want that
So if I can't find my condoms and I forgot where I put the box at
I'ma just call up Drake like "Yo where's your pops at? I need to borrow one of his yamaka top hats."
I'll treat 'em like emo kids, you know the ones stuck in a dark past
Rocking a broken heart tats
What he got in common with those goth cats?
Both of 'em are two seconds away from getting their wrist and their arms slashed
With pieces of sharp glass, arteries carved out
Bodies covered in large gashes
From laying on top of broken shards smashed
So much different colors of blood all over the walls splashed
It'll look like I set off a Boston Marathon bomb blast
Inside of a kindergarten art class
I'll have no regard for Ars' ass
I'll bring a grenade launcher to his garage where all of his cars are parked at
So hard that I'll have the whole front part of his front yard
Looking like Kanye's car crash
He'll literally have to pull a baby out the car dash
I'll show up to his house rocking a Saw mask with a sawed off Shotgun
Attached to blade saw that let's a blade off
Soon as you pop one, the bayonet is there
Cause if you run out of shells for the shotty and you don't got none
The blade keeps spinning in case the big homies from your block come
I'll still put Suge in a box then saw his body in half
That's what I call a Sawed off Shotgun
I can talk about Mossburgs, you know why Cortez?
Because I got one
The only thing he has in common with his shotgun is he lived in Detroit and forgot one
He went to the Motor City and this clown was scared
He was in the 313 and they him surrounded there
He denied he knew Suge
Then Calicoe snuck him out the back and down some stairs
He's like Elmer Fudd cause he threw Shotgun in a hole so he can get out here/hare

[Round 3: Arsonal]
My last round is titled "know how" cause you really gotta know how to win
But to be a winner you gotta be a splinter
You gotta know how to get up under your skin
See you gotta be equipped with fundamentals
And know how to begin but this was already over before it started so know how it'll end
You wish you knew then what you know now
But what you lack now is the know how
So your past was missing a father figure
To discipline you and tell you to slow down
This a dirty game, it's a dirty shame
And I heard Diz' was on the Low Down
But I already won after round 2 so here's 3 shot's from a 4 pound
Truthfully Diz', you a fan of mine
And I make my fans stand in line cause bars are sharper than a Samurai
When it's war time I'm in the camouflage
But when it come to taking battles seriously
You freestyle and you half ass like tanning lines
You fantasize about getting your hands dirty
But somehow you keep 'em sanitized
Nigga I'm here to give advice my nigga, that's right I can advise
You animated ass niggas will do anything for some camera time
If you ain't trying to get beat, then your swagger better get amplified
I mean your resume will speak for itself right? Til I hand 'em mine
You spitting random lines, fuck the 3 minutes I'll give you ample time
I'm Al Pacino in Scarface the way I handle lines
I wrote the blueprint on battle rap and I came up with the grand design
You living for the camera but your real life you can't rewind
So don't bite the hand that fixed your bottle
When your belly hand that empty feel
Cause this same hand will rock your cradle for the face on a $50 bill
Nigga my name Darell Jones
So when this DJ present and open this Cal lid (Khaled) to let it ring
You should know exactly how Nicki feel
Hold up, I said DJ Khaled present a ring to Nicki, eww
Hallelujah, I leave this nigga holy he a Bentley grill
I'm a word smith, how should I word this?
I ain't the one you wanna fight words with
I paved the way, I made it possible for this nigga to take a road trip
Youth, I'm full of grown age, you niggas ain't even cold sick
Disrespecting me gives you a life expectancy of a gold fish
Now remember this, I run through lines better than Emmitt Smith
Before the battle I pop the same pill as the nigga off of Limitless
I'm tweaking out, I'm hallucinating, I'm seeing all type of images
The way I write, my penmanship, I will revise the book of Genesis
You fucking up ya legacy, definitely, you freestyling having scrimmages
You a huge Diz-appointment and on that bar I put an emphasis
Cause it was a time when he was on a mission
He was having battles for free, fighting for no position
So if you wanted to experiment and play around with the freestyles then
That was your decision, but now it ain't funny
Cause these fans spent they hard earned money to go and listen
That's why I always put on a show
How that I rap for the doe/doh I'm Homer Simpson
Bars nigga, now let's put some shit in perspective
I was offered Diz' and I accepted
They said, "But Ars' you said you don't do rematches"
Like they wanted me to reject it
But they ain't put a battle nigga in front of me yet that I respected
So it's time I let my K-Shine, this Lebanese nigga got a death wish
Check this, clench my palm under my left writst
Cock back, feed him a knuckle off of my left fist
Introduce myself, get acquainted with ya ex bitch
Just to knock her walls down, I nicknamed her Tetris
I'm Grape Street Crip in all red, I like to set trip
Your jewels will get snatched on Cam, I make ya set dip
Your Juelz will get snatch on Cam', I'll make ya Set, Dip
Maury he is not the shooter, liar detected
Now let's play swear to God
I swear to God
After he battled Rex this bitch nigga called my phone and said, "Hey Ars' yo I swear to God man, the URL crowd they started booing me."
I said, "Diz', truthfully, that ain't got nothing to do with me
Why don't you setup a rematch, you and me
And I'm not battling for 2 or 3, quadruple that
Put it in writing and I'll start writing your eulogy."
Cause on the real nigga, Rex beat you, on the real Rex beat you
But I feel like I'ma step up
He bodied you in New York, in Canada I'm just aiming for the neck up
But we could've battled dead in the middle of Little Italy literally
But that head shot in Oakland knocked his lights out literally
But he ain't know every riddle the middle man who didn't do diddly
End up like a hockey player, they go in a box for every penalty
Now really though, I got a Canadian chopper for this stunt dummy
But it's different cause it was manufactured in the DR
It's an AK that's used to hunt mummies, shoot til i'ts on E
You get to the count of three to try and run from me
Nigga I just said I got a gun named Drake that'll take your Young Money
Bars nigga, I flip nouns, I'ma use some recycled shit this round
Cause I'm Mr. Disrespectful so the disrespectful shit's now
Shout out to Mr. Toronto cause we in his town
But you Drake after that cake and right now I'm feeling like Chris Brown
But we ain't fighting over Rihanna, ain't no bottles getting tossed to him
I'm throwing bullets and you catch 'em this Kaepernick and [?] year
Rifle scope on my hand gun, soon as I see you in the cross hair
"Terrorist down Mr. President. Mission all clear."
Now, them last few bars the man Drake might now like that
But I'm Kendrick Lamar dissing all of these rap niggas
And I bet you Drake ain't gon' fight back
Unless it's for Weezy cause he's down with his day one niggas
Let me hear you say, no new friends, no new friends, no new friends
No no new friends, he only down with his day one niggas
That mean I gotta fuck him
And Bishop Brigante up and tie all of the loose ends
I got two 9's that hold change for a 20
I give 'em two 10's
Guaranteed to leave all y'all smoked out like Snoop's friends
Why Drake ain't here? Cause I ain't want him hosting my battle
He did enough shit
I ain't mad at you Drake or the niggas that you fuck with
But cosigning Dizaster and Hollow Da Don that's some fuck shit
And it just go to show that a ll three of y'all
Will probably suck a nigga dick for some Trukfit
You got OVO that's major shit
Arsonal on some hating shit
I was a fan of Drake when he made the shit
But Lebanese niggas just ain't the shit
Versace Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm illuminati
King Of The Dot is for battlers that's why Drake not on this property
Versace Versace, Medusa's head on me like I'm illuminati
King of the Dot is for battlers that's why Drake not on this property
You ain't fucking Halle Berry you represent nigga monogamy
I own my own league, the UW gon' be the biggest monopoly
Cause he Started From The Bottom now he here
He Started From The Bottom but I really don't fucking care
I started from the bottom and I'm still here
I got a DE named Degrassi that'll put you and Drake back in the wheelchair
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
Nah fuck all that, tell him, tell Drake, tell his skateboarding ass boss
You can't spell "bars" without putting that "Ars" in it

[Round 3: Dizaster]
Get you Aunt Jemima fucking haircut the fuck outta here
Aye yo, shut the fuck up with all the bullshit Ars'
You see that's how we know you a fake dude
And now you want shock value in every battle
So you going off dissing Drake too
But if you a real man you would've just appreciated
The fact that he's the one that fucking paid you
Bitch, why don't you just take the check and be respectful?
Why you always have to be so "Arsonal Da Rebel I'm so disrespectful"?
You're not Arsonal Da Rebel, man I should fucking punch him
He didn't sound like he was mad at Drake cause he wasn't here
He sounded like he was mad at Drake cause he wants to fuck him
That fuck was that shit?
You ain't Arsonal Da Rebel, you're Arsonal the Attention Whore
Ya mother's fat bitch, she's a 10 chin whore
When it comes to your bars and your metaphors, my policy is "less is more"
Yeah your bars are awesome Ars', awesome just like your credit score
You think I give a fuck what you and your little nerds say about me on a message board?
When half of them look like Wee Man
This battle gon' be like He-Man versus Skelator
I'll beat the fuck outta you with my bare hands
What the hell would I need weapons for? I'll go head to head with you
Shred you from head to toe deck you and leave you headless
My elbows are welded like Zelda's sword
What the fuck would I need weapons for?
I'll set this whole building on fire and reroute you to the exit door
And soon as you go down the steps
I'll drop a gallon of water and wet the floor
And scream "Ars!" and you turn around and I'll toss you an electric cord
Peace out, let's get it popping
The heavy metal been rocking since '7-4
I'll bust a shot to Biggie and 'Pac and have you knocking on Heaven's Door
This dude is fake as fuck, he's not my friend
He's just my friend depending on occasion
See I already knew you was bipolar, that was confirmation
Of all the constant changes
Now I flew half way across the nation
Not knowing what type of twat I'm facing
This ain't even a battle
This an anonymous blind date with a broad like online dating
I'm amongst these stars like Sagan
He wanted the spotlight but King Of The Dot's hype's taken
I'm like James Bond the agent
If being a doctor was also his part time occupation
Cause either way it goes you gon' end up in the lobby pacing
Like a hospital patient patiently waiting
For a black market heart replacement
I will stomp you through the Toronto pavement
Pull out my fucking rug and start to praise him
Like Assalamualaikum then snatch the Star Of David off of Drake
And use it to carve Ars' face in so hard
That the marks I make will indect his grill like fossil traces
On carbon dated rock formations
Who want it too? Pat Stay?
I'ma battle you next you big ass motherfucker
Lame I'm kidnapping you too and if you actually go missing Pat would Stay missing
Cause nobody would actually pay back the ransom to get 'em
The only person on Earth that would actually miss him
Is the faggot behind the desk selling him all his tanning prescriptions
I told Organik I didn't wanna come back 'til I killed him
Then he put me in front of him, so I'm back on a mission
Back grabbing ammunition, back, I'ma attack his rap battling militia man
When I activate catalyst in him
People know, my aim istoo close range with the scrap so efficient
But I'm more crafty from a distance
I have more advantage when I'm hidden
I could camp out with the black out from a tactical position
Sideways in the highway windy ass conditions
Like this and accurately hit 'em, bullets flying through his crib
Blood splattered through the kitchen
Have his whole pad looking like the Spanish Inquisition
I'll leave him on his back looking stiff like a rat when the venom
Starts traveling in him after a poisonous Adder just bit him
These fans said I fell off, they had me trapped in this prison
But I can't fall off, I can never be captured as a victim
Nah, they said Dizaster's no longer has it in him
But that's an illusion, I'm a rap battle magician
And Houdini always evades capture
And escapes from the shackles he's given
And now I'm back and cataclysmic
If I had Organik's position, I would've handled things different
I"ll snatch the chain off Arcane
Smack the fuck outta him and strangle him with it
And transfer him to his old league, call it the Faggot Division
Where only him and Manic were in it
You fake gangster!
Who does this fake ass Crip shit in battles besides you?
And then you roll around telling people you're who they wanna be like
Who the fuck would ever wanna be like you?
Be like who?
Some weak IQ low life piece of shit who constantly glorifies being in the street like you?
Why?
So I could be able to tell people I'm a G like you?
Fuck your life that we see right through
That ain't real life, you need to realize too, I chill with real Grapes
None of them move, act, talk or even speak like you
You copy what the G's do on the screen and copy what he might do
See to them you might be a G, but to me
You got a facade I could see right through
Unless you go to LA and bang on them Bloods that be Damu
That'll beat you 'til your Levi's blue
I said you'll get beat 'til you left eye's blue
I ain't no gangster, but I could shoot you to win a 3-5 too
I ain't married to this Thug Life but oh I vow if it's beef we're engaging in
I'ma let it ring "I do"
See you, you ain't hot, you be talking 'bout how you gangsta
I'm Lebanese, you think you more like you from the block
Well let's tell the difference then
Okay see when you and your homies was setting up the shop
Barely getting popped for your nickel bags
Set, jet and getting arrest by the cops
I was in Lebanon getting my ass beat by soldiers whether I expected it or not
I got my shoulder busted by a fucking soldier
Cause I went deaf and I wouldn't talk
When he was in the hood with his homies and they were all impressed with their little Glock
Ray Swag was next to him like, "Damn this shit carries 11 shots."
I was in Lebanon dodging AK-47's bullets
Three buildings away from watching helicopter's drop
See when you went went to your first funeral
Cause you lost your homies Terrance and Roc
Yeah, by then I had turned 20 and seen 37 of my friends and relatives get shot
See I'll be damned if I have a spoiled American tell me what I'm not
Cause if my boys moved to where you at in Jersey
They'd think it's Heaven on your block
If your homies came to live with us in Beirut
They'd be all huddled up together in a flock on a broken radio like "Call up the embassy and tell 'em we're from Watts!"
See Ars' raps about shit with his imagination because it's easy to write
But a real third world country or war zone is something that he's never seen in his life
He doesn't understand what the feeling is like
To have military beat you and trap you in a cage
And leave you without reading your rights
He doesn't understand how it is to have F16's bomb your region
To the point that you can't sleep in the night
I'll be staring at my food for 7 hours straight
Cause I couldn't eat from the fight
To watching a grown mad crying in the middle of the street holding a piece of his wife
Do you know what it feels to be like barely 13
Barely ever reaching the peak of your height
But still given an M-16 and told to join the regime and go fight?
See I've seen it, that's the type of shit your preach, I've seen with my eyes
Oh yeah I did, so next time you tell people to do that here's some realer advice
Tell them young kids in your hood they need to think twice
And before they carry fucking heats
Tell 'em to put themselves in our shoes for one day to actually see what it's like
And maybe you spoiled piece of shit Americans
Could actually appreciate the meaning of life
He wants to talk about bars, okay y'all pay attention
Cause I'm a bar bury him with so many bars he gon' get buried/Barry like Bonds
I'm a Pallbearer him
I'm like Winnie the Pooh if he was locked up, I bare/bear bars
I'm a Bakranian bar carrying barbarian
With a nut sack like a bag of ball bearings, why y'all staring?
They say freestyle's a lost era, so the way my writtens function
Like a Hollywood film production, my hand a bar bearer/Hanna Barbera
I can use these hands to craft bars or use 'em to cause terror
Catch you sitting down getting this paper then out of nowhere "BAM" like Margera
I'm someone you cannot see/Nazi
I'l turn a Bar Mitzvah into a barbecue
With one from me
I'm like Homer simpson's son
I got it down with this Bar to a T
Punchlines, delivery, aggression, comedy
Gun bars, multi-syllables, you get it all from me
I even freestyle a large percentage, I'm argumentative, no holds barred
I don't got no limit, let's see if Ars' with it
He say he Watts with it, he rock a false image
They say you can't spell "bars" without putting the "Ars" in it
But ain't no "Ars" in authentic, fuck Ars', I'm arsenic
I got an Arsenal of carcinogens, I'm an arsonist, set fire to his...
{​​​Diz gets cut off}​​​

{​​​​​​​​​​​Dizaster's post interview battle raps}​​​​​​​​​​​​
...I don't got no limit, let's see if Ars' with it
If a real freestyler challenge you
We’ll see the Ultimate Warrior get all timid
And choke up like he did against Aye Verb and f-f-f-forgot lyrics
You ain’t Watts with it, you got a false image
They say, ain’t no spelling BARS without putting ARS in it
Ain’t no Ars in authentic, fuck Ars, I’m Arsenic
I got an Arsenal of carcinogens, I’m an arsonist
I’ll set fire to ya apartment and throw Ars in it
And raid in his office & fire like Donald Trump until I got the job finished
I’ll pour gasoline on his head, gasoline on his head
Then cut off his cartilage and when the cops ask me “Who?”
I tell em it wasn’t me the guy from Reservoir Dogs did it
I give a fuck about hip hop and whoever’s hot in it
Kendrick Lamar’s the only MC in the game that dissing is off limits
Are you fucking kidding me? I don’t give a fuck about Kendrick Lamar
I’ll take Kendrick Lamar’s spirit and ball it up into a ball
And play soccer with it in my fucking backyard with it
I’ll trap him in one of those little Ghostbuster boxes & leave it boxed in it
Toss it in the front seat of my car and drive off with it
And knock it off a cliff
While I’m doing 120 miles per miles in my moms Civic
Fuck you, you get barred to death
Ars my bars connect like an architect
I bar your head like you got caught in barbwire
I’m over your head like a barber's breath
My bars over your head like I’m writing bars on a charter jet
Don’t get caught in that crossfire, my bars fuego to Ars Halo
That’s why we haven’t seen Ars sing yet
I got my own island of bars I call it Barbados
These bars thicker than Barneys neck
We don’t barter with bars, that’s what Arcane does
Them bar stools, not the shit that you sit on
The shit that you shit on like bar stools
You taking way more shots, cool, I’m on a bar bender
I’m complex way beyond you, I got bars, Bender
Which means I also bend bars too, I’m an Arch Welder
Before you start serving up shots you need to go back to bar school
Cause your bars tender, you everything Ars do is off centered
You soft tendered, cross gendered, lost member from Pharcyde
Truth is your future would’ve looked a lot better
Rapping along side of B Rabbit
