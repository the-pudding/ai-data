Got to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the drive-in show
She turned the speaker down
And then she turned on the radio
I watched a silent movie digging funky sound

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Uh huh, she's got the boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the pizza parlor (Pizza parlor)
To get a bite to eat.  Ah, ah, ah
I put some money in the jukebox for her
You know she ate a pizza dancing to the beat

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Uh huh, she's got the boogie fever
I think it's going around

All night long, we did the bump, bump, bump
Yes we did, yes we did, yes we did, yeah.  (Yeah.)
She kept it going strong doing the bump, bump, bump
Doing the bump, bump, bump, yeah.  (Yeah.)
You might also likeI called my doctor on the telephone.  (Doctor, doctor)
Said doctor, doctor, please, I-I-I
I got this feeling rocking and a-reeling
Tell me, what can it be?
Is it some new disease?

They call it boogie fever
You got to boogie down
Uh huh, just get on down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

Fever

Fever
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh

All night long, we did the bump, bump, bump
Yes we did, yes we did, yes we did.  (Yeah.)
She kept it going strong doing the bump, bump, bump
Yeah

Everybody's got the boogie fever.  (Boogie fever, baby.)

Just get on down, just get on down
Boogie fever.  (B-B-Boogie fever, baby.)
I think it's going around and around and around
I said I (I) got the boogie fever
And I said you (You) got the boogie fever

Everybody's got the boogie fever
