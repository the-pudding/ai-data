5 ContributorsRamblinâ€™ Rose LyricsRamblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why you ramble, no one knows
Wild and wind-blown, that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

Ramble on, ramble on
When your ramblin' days are gone
Who will love you with a love true
When your ramblin' days are gone

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, Heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
(One more time, everybody, now)

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, Heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?You might also likeEmbed
