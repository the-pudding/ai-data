26 ContributorsStickwitu Lyrics[Intro: Nicole Scherzinger]
Ooh, ooh
C'mon

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
I don't wanna go another day
So I'm tellin' you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breakin' up
And throwin' their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say (Hey)

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls, Melody Thornton]
Nobody gonna love me better (Mmm)
I'ma stick wit' you forever (Mmm)
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick wit' you (Mmm)
You know how to 'preciate me
I'ma stick wit' you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick wit' you

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
I don't wanna go another day
So I'm tellin' you exactly what is on my mind
See the way we ride in our private lives
Ain't nobody gettin' in between
I want you to know that you're the only one for me (One for me)
And I say
You might also like[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls, Melody Thornton, Nicole Scherzinger]
Nobody gonna love me better (Mmm)
I'ma stick wit' you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'ma stick wit' you (Nobody)
You know how to 'preciate me
I'ma stick wit' you, my baby (Yeah)
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'ma stick wit' you

[Verse 3: Nicole Scherzinger]
And now
Ain't nothin' else I could need (Nothin' else I could need)
And now
I'm singin' 'cause you're so, so into me
I got you
We'll be makin' love endlessly
I'm with you (Baby, I'm wit' you)
Baby, you're with me (Baby, you're with me, higher)

[Bridge: Nicole Scherzinger & Carmit Bachar, Nicole Scherzinger, Melody Thornton]
So don't you worry about
People hangin' around
They ain't bringin' us down
I know you and you know me
And that's all that counts (Hey, hey)
So don't you worry about
People hangin' around
They ain't bringin' us down (Mmm)
I know you and you know me
And that's, that's why I say (Hey)
[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls, Nicole Scherzinger]
Nobody gonna love me better
I'ma stick wit' you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
