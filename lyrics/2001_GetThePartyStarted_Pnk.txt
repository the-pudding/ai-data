Ha-ha

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started

[Verse 1]
Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Sending out the message to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lots of style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started

[Verse 2]
Pumping up the volume, breaking down to the beat
Cruising through the Westside, we'll be checking the scene
Boulevard is freaking as I'm coming up fast
I'll be burning rubber, you'll be kissing my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
License plate says, "Stunner: #1 Superstar"
See P!nk LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, so you better)
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
Get this party started

[Verse 3]
Making my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove
Pumping up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancing and they're dancing for me
I'm your operator, you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, so you better)
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started

[Outro]
Get this party started (Ooh)

Get this party started (Ooh)
Get this party started
Get this party started right now5Embed
