27 ContributorsWhat I Am Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box
Religion is the smile on a dog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know if you know what I mean

[Bridge]
Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

[Chorus]
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are, or what?

[Verse 2]
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
Philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocks
Religion is a light in the fog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean

[Bridge]
Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep
You might also like[Chorus]
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are, or what?

[Bridge]
Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

[Chorus]
Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

[Outro]
Don't let me get too deep

[Chorus]
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are, or what?7Embed
