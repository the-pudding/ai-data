54 ContributorsI Donâ€™t Want to Miss a Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

[Verse 2]
Lying close to you, feelin' your heart beating
And I'm wonderin' what you're dreamin'
Wonderin' if it's me you're seein'
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever
