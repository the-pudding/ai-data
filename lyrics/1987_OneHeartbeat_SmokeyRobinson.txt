8 ContributorsOne Heartbeat Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh baby, oh-ah, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Two hearts, two of a kind
Love at first sight
Why do they say love is blind?
Slow down
We don't have to move fast
'Cause the love that is real
Is made to last

[Chorus]
Take it one heartbeat
At a time
Close your eyes
And let your soul unwind
Sooner or later
It'll all fall in line
If we take it
One heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

[Verse 2]
Oooh
We paint a picture
Walkin' down the street
Leaves are fallin', baby
So are we
Hand in hand
That's the way it should be
How could somethin' so easy
Make me feel so complete

Take it one heartbeat
At a time
Close your eyes
And let your soul unwind
Sooner or later
It'll all fall in line
If we take it
One heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat at a time

[Bridge]
Take it easy, ooh
I want to feel your every emotion
Shh... don't talk
And we'll be makin' love
In slow motion, oooh
Slow motion, baby
Slow motion, baby

[Chorus]
Take it one heartbeat
At a time
Close your eyes
And let your soul unwind
Sooner or later
It'll all fall in line
If we take it
One heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat
One heartbeat at a time
Slow motion baby
One heartbeat ow!
Slow motion baby
Sooner or later
It'll all fall in line
If we take it

One heartbeat yeah
One heartbeat ooh, baby
Sooner or later
It'll all fall in line
If we take it
One heartbeat
If we take itEmbed
