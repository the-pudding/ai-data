One, two, three, four, tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights, that is what my youth was for
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing, but they want some more

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are

[Verse 2]
Sweetheart, bitter heart, now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are

[Bridge]
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are
Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are
Who you are (Woo-ooh)

[Outro]
For, for the teenage boys
They're breakin' your heart
For the teenage boys
They're breakin' your heart11Embed
