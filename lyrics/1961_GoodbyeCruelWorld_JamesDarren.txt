(Goodbye, cruel world)
(Goodbye, cruel world)

[Verse 1]
Oh, goodbye, cruel world
I'm off to join the circus
Gonna be a broken-hearted clown (Ah)
Paint my face with a good-for-nothin' smile
'Cause a mean, fickle woman
Turned my whole world upside-down
(Goodbye, cruel world)

[Verse 2]
Farewell to love (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm off to join the circus
Gotta find a way to hide my tears (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then I'll have them rollin' in the aisle (Ah)
And I'll forget that woman
If it takes a hundred years
(Goodbye, cruel world, ooh)

[Bridge]
Oh, step right up (Ooh)
And take a look at a fool (Doo-da-loo-doo-doo)
He has got a heart (Doo-da-doo)
As stubborn as a mule (Doo-da-loo-doo, ah)
Come on, everybody, he's good for a laugh
And no one could tell his heart is broken in half
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, the joke's on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm off to join the circus
Oh, Mr. Barnum, save a place for me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Shoot me out of a cannon, I don't care (Ah)
Let the people point at me and stare (Ah)
I'll tell the world that woman (Ah, ah)
Wherever she may be (Ah)
That mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown out of me
(Goodbye, cruel world)

[Chorus]
Shoot me out of a cannon, I don't care (Ah)
Let the people point at me and stare (Ah)
I'll tell the world that woman (Ah, ah)
Wherever she may be (Ah)
That mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown out of me

[Outro]
Goodbye, cruel world
Goodbye, cruel world
Goodbye, cruel world
Goodbye, cruel worldEmbed
