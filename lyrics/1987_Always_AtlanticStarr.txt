15 ContributorsAlways Lyrics[Verse 1: Wayne Lewis and Barbara Weathers]
Girl, you are to me
All that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life
To you, always
The love like yours is rare
It must have been
Sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way
For always

[Pre-Chorus: Wayne Lewis and Barbara Weathers, Barbara Weathers]
And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever
It will be
You and me, hey

[Chorus: Wayne Lewis and Barbara Weathers]
Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasin' all of the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days
You're the perfect one
For me and you
Forever will be
And I will love you so
For always
