5 ContributorsBlue on Blue LyricsBlue on blue, heartache on heartache
Blue on blue, now that we are through –
Blue on blue, heartache on heartache
And I find I can't get over losing you!

I walk along the street we used to walk –
Two by two, lovers pass
And as they're passing by
I could die
'Cause you're not here with me!
Now the trees are bare, there's
Sadness in the air and
I'm as blue as I can be!

Blue on blue, heartache on heartache
Blue on blue, now that we are through –
Blue on blue, heartache on heartache
And I find I can't get over losing you!

Night after lonely night, we meet in dreams
As I run to your side
You wait with open arms –
Open arms
That now are closed to me!
Through a veil of tears your
Vision disappears and
I'm as blue as I can be!
