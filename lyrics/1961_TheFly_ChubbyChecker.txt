6 ContributorsThe Fly Lyrics[Intro]
*Buzzing*

[Verse 1]
Come on, come on and do the fly with me
Hey, come on, everybody, and do the fly with me
Well, if you don't know how to do it, just watch and see

[Verse 2]
You gotta shake your hands all around and around the sky
And then you buzz around the floor, you can do it if you really try
All the girls and guys are gettin' fly, they're gonna fly

[Verse 3]
Oh, you, pretty little girl, come and fly away with me
Hey, pretty little girl, fly away with me
We're gonna fly to the sky but you'll never fly away from me
Oh, yeah, hey!

*Buzzing*

[Saxophone Solo]
Ah, awo!

[Verse 2]
Doncha know?
You've gotta shake your hands all around and around the sky
And then you buzz around the floor, you can do it if you really try
All the girls and guys are gettin' one, they're gonna fly
Fly high, baby
