I have a picture
Pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me
And we're laughing, we're loving it all
But look at our life now
All tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and delight in the tears
That we cry until dawn
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Hold me now, woah
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start

[Verse 2]
You say I'm a dreamer
We're two of a kind
Both of us searching for some perfect world
We know we'll never find
So, perhaps I should leave here
Yeah, yeah, and go far away
But you know that there's nowhere
That I'd rather be, than with you here today
Oh, woah, oh, woah

Hold me now, woah
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start, woah
Hold me now, woah
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start
Woah

[Verse 3]
You ask if I love you
Well, what can I say?
You know that I do and that this is just one
Of those games that we play
So, I'll sing you a new song
Please don't cry anymore
I'll even ask your forgiveness, though I don't know
Just what I'm asking it for
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Hold me now (Hold me in your lovin' arms), woah
Warm my heart (Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (Stay with me)
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start
Woah, hold me now (Hold me in your lovin' arms), woah
Warm my heart (Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (Stay with me)
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start
Woah, hold me now (Hold me in your lovin' arms), woah
Warm my heart (Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (Stay with me)
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start
Woah, hold me now (Hold me in your lovin' arms), woah
Warm my heart (Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (Stay with me)
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start
Woah, hold me now (Hold me in your lovin' arms), woah
Warm my heart (Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (Stay with me)
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start9Embed
