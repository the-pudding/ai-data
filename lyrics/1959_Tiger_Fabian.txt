4 ContributorsTiger Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, lumpa sugar, you look kinda sweet
Cuter than a baby walkin' down the street
When I look into your eyes, I wanna leap
I can't conceal that you make me feel

[Chorus]
Like a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh
Like a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh
Just to see you smile
Nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl, wow!

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' stronger than a grizzly bear
Soarin' like an eagle flyin' through the air
When I get you in my arms, you'd better beware
I go insane 'cause I can't be tamed

[Chorus]
Like a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh
Like a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh
Just to see you smile
Nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl, wow!
You might also like[Bridge]
You keep my heart jumpin' like a kangaroo
Floatin' like an onion in a bowl of stew
Baby, every time you come in view
I run like an antelope to get to you

[Verse 3]
I'm your tiger, and you're my mate
Hurry up, buttercup, and don't be late
I might get mad if I have to wait
Come right now 'cause I'm on the prowl

[Chorus]
Like a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh
Like a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh
Just to see you smile
Nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl, wow!

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You keep my heart jumpin' like a kangaroo
Floatin' like an onion in a bowl of stew
Baby, every time you come in view
I run like an antelope to get to you
[Verse 3]
I'm your tiger, and you're my mate
Hurry up, buttercup, and don't be late
I might get mad if I have to wait
Come right now 'cause I'm on the prowl

[Chorus]
Like a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh
Like a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh
Just to see you smile
Nearly drives me wild
I wanna growl, wow!Embed
