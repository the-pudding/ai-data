36 ContributorsNever Tear Us Apart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

[Chorus]
I… I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

[Verse 2]
We could live for a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you that we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

[Chorus]
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

[Chorus]
I… (Don't ask me)
I was standing  (You know it's true)
Mmm, you were there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (We're shining through)
And they could never tear us apart

[Chorus]
You… (Don't ask me)
You were standing (You know it's true)
I was there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (We're shining through)
And they could never tear us apart

[Outro]
I… I was standing
You were there12Embed
