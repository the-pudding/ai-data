Call me a joker, call me a fool
Right at this moment I'm totally cool
Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife
I feel like I'm in the prime of my life
Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast
I don't know how long
This feeling will last
Maybe it's only tonight

[Chorus]
Darling, I don't know
Why I go to extremes
Too high or too low
There ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling, I don't know
Why I go to extremes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
Sometimes I don't know
How much more I've got
Maybe I'm headed over the hill
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much
Do you think you can take
Until the heart in you
Is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will

Darling, I don't know
Why I go to extremes
Too high or too low
There ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling, I don't know
Why I go to extremes

[Verse 3]
Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong
Or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

[Bridge]
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling, I don't know
Why I go to extremes
[Chorus]
Oh, I don't know
Why I go to extremes
Too high or too low
There ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling, I don't know
Why I go to extremes

[Outro]
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
Out of the dark, into the lights
Whether I'm wrong, perfectly right
I don't know why1Embed
