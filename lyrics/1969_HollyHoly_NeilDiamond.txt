Where I am, what I am
What I believe in
Holly holy

Holly holy dream
Wanting only you
And she come
And I run just like the wind will
Holly holy

Sing a song
Sing a song of songs
Sing it out, Sing it strong
Yeah! Yeah!

Call the sun in the dead of the night
And the sun gonna rise in the sky
Touch a man who can't walk upright
And that lame man, he gonna fly
And I fly, yeah, And I fly

Holly holy love
Take the lonely child
And the seed
Let it be full with tomorrow
Holly holy
