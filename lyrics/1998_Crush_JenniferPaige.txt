15 ContributorsCrush Lyrics[Intro]
Ah
Crush
Ah

[Verse 1]
See you blowin' me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on, baby
If you see something in my eye
Let's not overanalyze
Don't go too deep with it, baby (Baby)

[Pre-Chorus]
So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

[Chorus]
It's just (Ahh) a little crush (Crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just (Ahh) some little thing (Crush)
Not like everything I do
Depends on you
You might also like[Break]
Sha, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la

[Verse 2]
It's raising my adrenaline
You're banging on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it, baby (Baby)
Say that we're forevermore
That's not what I'm looking for
All I can commit to is maybe (Maybe)

[Pre-Chorus]
So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me
(Crazy over you and me)
Here's what I do, I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
It's just (Ahh) a little crush (Crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just (Ahh) some little thing (Crush)
Not like everything I do
Depends on you
[Break]
Sha, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la

[Bridge]
Vanilla skies (Vanilla skies)
White picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me (And me, and me)

[Chorus]
It's just (Ahh) a little crush (Crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just (Ahh) some little thing (Crush)
Not like everything I do (Everything I do)
Depends on you

[Break]
Sha, la, la, la

[Outro]
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I doEmbed
