Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray)
I could break away

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

[Verse 2]
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Far away (I will)
And break away

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

[Bridge]
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away
[Chorus 2]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun (Into the sun)
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

[Outro]
