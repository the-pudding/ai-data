8 ContributorsUndercover Angel Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Right

[Verse 1]
Cryin' on my pillow, lonely in my bed
Then I heard a voice beside me and she softly said
"Wonder is your nightlight, magic is your dream"
And as I held her, she said, "See what I mean"

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "What?"
She said, "Ooh-ooh-ooh-ee"
I said, "Alright"
She said ,"Love me, love me, love me"

[Chorus]
Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I never had a dream that made sweet love to me, ooh
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there
(Somewhere) Yes, somewhere

[Verse 2]
Heavenly surrender, sweet afterglow (Undercover)
I'm givin' up my heart to you, now angel don't go
She said, "Go find the right one, love her and then (Undercover)
When you look into her eyes, you'll see me again"

I said, "What?"
She said, "Ooh-ooh-ooh-ee"
I said, "Alright"
She said ,"Love me, love me, love me"

[Chorus]
Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I never had a dream that made sweet love to me, ooh
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there
(Somewhere) Woah, somewhere

[Verse 3]
Now you know my story, and girl, if it's right
I'm gonna take you in my arms and love you tonight
Underneath the covers, the answer lies
I'm lookin' for my angel in your sweet, lovin' eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "What?" (Undercover, undercover)
I said, "Ooh-ooh-ooh-ee" (Undercover, undercover)
She said, "Alright" (Undercover, undercover)
I said, "Get next to me" (Undercover, undercover)
She said, "What?" (Undercover, undercover)
I said, "Ooh-ooh-ooh-ee" (Undercover, undercover)
She said, "Alright" (Undercover, undercover)
She said, "Love me, love me, love me"
[Chorus]
Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me, ooh
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me
(You made me, you made me, you made me, you made me)
Love me, love me, love me

[Chorus]
Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me, ooh
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me
(You made me, you made me, you made me, you made me)

Out there (Somewhere)
Woah, out there (Somewhere)
Yeah, out there (Somewhere)
Out there (Somewhere)
Out there, out there (Somewhere)...Embed
