Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find
They're only cheques I've left unsigned
From the banks of chaos in my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me

[Chorus]
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

[Verse 2]
Poets, priests, and politicians
Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no one's jamming their transmission
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause when their eloquence escapes you
Their logic ties you up and rapes you

[Chorus]
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

[Chorus]
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true3Embed
