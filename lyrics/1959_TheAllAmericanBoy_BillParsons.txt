1 ContributorThe All American Boy LyricsGather 'round, cats, and I'll tell you a story
About how to become an all American boy
Buy you a guitar and put it in tune
You'll be rockin' and rollin' soon

Impressin' the girls
Pickin' hot licks
And all that jazz

I-I bought me a guitar a year ago
Learned how to play in a day or so
And all around town it was well understood
That I was knockin' 'em out like Johnny B. Goode

Hot licks
Showin' off
Ah, number one

Well, I 'd practice all day and up into the night
My papa's hair was turnin' white
'Cause he didn't like rock'n'roll
He said, "You can stay, boy, but that's gotta go."

He's a square
He just didn't dig me at all
You might also likeSo I took my guitar, picks and all
And bid farewell to my poor ole pa
Split for Memphis where they say y'all
Them swingin' cats are havin' a ball

Sessions
Hot licks and all
They dig me

I was rockin' and boppin' and I's a gettin' the breaks
The girls all said that I had what it takes
When up stepped a man with a big cigar
He said, "Come here, cat, I'm gonna make you a star."

"I'll put you on Bandstand
Buy ya a Cadillac
Sign here, kid."

I signed my name and became a star
Havin' a ball with my guitar
Driving a big long Cadillac
And fightin' the girls off ma back

They just kept a'comin'
Screamin'
Yeah, they like it
So I'd pick my gittar with a great big grin
And the money just kept on pourin' in
But then one day my Uncle Sam
He said, "Here I am"

"Uncle Sam needs you, boy
I'm-a gonna cut your hair
Ah, take this rifle, kid
Gimme that guitar" yeahEmbed
