Take me home, take me home
Want to feel you close to me
Take me home, take me home
With you is where I wanna be
Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just making love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

[Chorus]
Take me home (Take me home)
Take me home (Take me home)
Oh, can't you see I want you near?
(Can't you see I want you?)
Take me home (Take me home)
Take me home (Take me home)
Ooh baby, let's get out of here

[Verse 2]
I'd follow you anywhere, your place or mine
Just a one-night affair would be so fine

[Refrain]
I'm in heaven (Heaven)
Seems like heaven (Heaven)
So much in heaven (Heaven)
(Take me home)
(Take me home)

Seems like heaven (Heaven)
So much in heaven (Heaven)
Take me home

With you, I'd be walking right out that door (Right out that door)
One night with you lying here next to me
