27 ContributorsTake the Long Way Home Lyrics[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
So you think you're a Romeo
You're playing a part in a picture-show
Well, take the long way home
Take the long way home

[Verse 2]
'Cause you're the joke of the neighbourhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good?
Well, take the long way home
Take the long way home

[Chorus 1]
There are times that you feel you're part of the scenery
All the greenery
Is comin' down, boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar
She used to be so nice

[Verse 3]
When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home
You might also like[Verse 4]
You never see what you wanna see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home

[Chorus 2]
And when you're up on the stage, it's so unbelievable
Oh, unforgettable
How they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity
Oh, calamity
Or is there no way out?
Oh yeah!

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 3]
Does it feel that your life's become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be
For you to grow, boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been
If you would have more time

[Verse 5]
So when the day comes to settle down
Who's to blame if you're not around?
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
[Bridge]
You took the long way home
Do it again
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Oh, yah!
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Ooh, yeah
You took the long way home

[Break]
Aah, aah, aah, aah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Aah, aah, aah, aah

[Outro]
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home3Embed
