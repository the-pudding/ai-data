1 ContributorThe Chipmunksâ€™ Sound LyricsAlvin, Simon, and Theodore are in a recording booth, ready to record another song.

[Recording Producer]

Okay, let's take it from the top.

[Alvin, Simon, and Theodore]

Singing in terrible deep, tuneless voices] Christmas, Christmastime is here/time for nuts and time for beer/Christmas, Christmastime is here.David Seville and the producer are in the recording studio. David is covering his ears because of the Chipmunks' awful singing voices.

[David Seville]

Aw, they're just so terrible! They've eaten me out of house and home! They've got to go! [walks over to the recording booth door, picks up a canister of deadly helium, sets it off, opens the door, throws the canister into the booth, then closes the door, as the helium spreads around the room]

[Alvin, Simon, and Theodore]

Still singing as the helium makes their voices become much higher to their trademark pitch] Christmas, Christmas Poop De Poop/Don't buy me a hula hoop.

[David]

Completely impressed with the Chipmunks' new voices

They're fantastic!

[Recording Producer]
This could sell thousands of albums.

The Chipmunks inhale too much helium, asphyxiate, and die.

[David]

Oh right... [tsk] The deadly helium...Embed
