6 ContributorsShop Around Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just because you've become a young woman now
There's still some things that you don't understand now
Before you ask some guy for his hand now
You keep your freedom for as long as you can now
My mama told me, "You better shop around"
Mhm-mm, you better shop around, woo

[Verse 2]
There's some things that I want you to know now
Just as sure as the wind's gonna blow now
The men'll come and the men are gonna go now
Before you tell 'em that you love 'em so now
My mama told me, "You better shop around"
Uh-huh-huh, you better shop around

[Chorus]
Try to get yourself a bargain, girl
Don't be sold on the very first one
Good-looking guys come a dime a dozen
Try to find you one who's gonna give you true lovin'

[Post-Chorus]
Before you take a man and say "I do" now
Make sure he's in love with you now
My mama told me, "You better shop around"
Uh-huh-huh, you better shop around, ooh

La, da-da-da, da-da

Uh-huh-huh

[Chorus]
Try to get yourself a bargain, girl
Don't you be sold on the very first one
Good-looking guys come a dime a dozen
Try to find you one who's gonna give you true lovin'

[Post-Chorus]
Before you take a guy and say "I do" now
Make sure he's in love with you now
Make sure his love is true now
I hate to see you feeling sad and blue now
My mama told me, "You better shop around"
Uh-huh-huh, you better shop around, uh-huh

[Outro]
You better shop around, oh yeah
You better shop around, uh-huh
You better shop around, oh yeah
You better, you better
You better shop, shop around, oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-huh
You better shop around, oh yeah
You better shop, shop, shop, shop
Shop-shop-shop, shop, shop, shop, yeah
You better shop around, shop around, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Shop around, shop around, shop aroundEmbed
