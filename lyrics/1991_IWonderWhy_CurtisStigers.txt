Love is a hunger
That burns in my soul
But you never notice the pain
Love is an anchor
That won't let me go
I reach out to hold you
But you push me away
You always convince to stay

[Refrain]
And I wonder why
We hold on with tears in your eyes
And I wonder why
We have to break down to just make things right
And I wonder why
I can't seem to tell you goodbye
Yeah, I wonder why

[Verse 2]
I'm no angel
With my selfish pride
But I love you more everyday
Love is an anger
That builds up inside
As the tears of frustration
Roll down my face
Why does love always have to turn out this way?

And I wonder why
We hold on with tears in your eyes
And I wonder why
We have to break down to just make things right
And I wonder why
I can't seem to tell you goodbye
Oh, I wonder why1Embed
