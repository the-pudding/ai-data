31 ContributorsNightshift Lyrics[Verse 1]
Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing a song, his heart in every line
Marvin sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds, and I still can hear him say
"Aw talk to me, so you can see, what's going on"
Say you will sing your songs forevermore

[Chorus]
Gonna be some sweet sounds coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone on the nightshift

[Verse 2]
Jackie, hey what you doing now?
It seems like yesterday when we were working out
Jackie, oh you set the world on fire
You came and gifted us, your love it lifted us higher and higher
Keep it up and we'll be there at your side
Oh, say you will sing your songs forevermore

[Chorus]
Gonna be some sweet sounds coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone on the nightshift
Gonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone on the nightshift
Gonna miss your sweet voice, that soulful noise on the nightshift
We all remember you, your songs are coming through
At the end of a long day, it's gonna be okay on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone on the nightshift
Gonna be some sweet soundsSee Commodores LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like4Embed
