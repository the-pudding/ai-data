57 ContributorsBeautiful Lyrics[Intro]
Don't look at me
Mm, mm
Oh
Ooh, oh, mm

[Verse 1]
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed

[Chorus]
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

[Verse 2]
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

[Bridge]
No matter what we do
(No matter what we do)
No matter what we say
(No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune
(Yeah)
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go
(And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
(The sun will always, always shine)
And tomorrow we might wake on the other side

[Chorus]
'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today
[Outro]
Ooh-oh-oh, yeah
Don't you bring me down today
Yeah, ooh
Don't you bring me down
Ooh, today32Embed
