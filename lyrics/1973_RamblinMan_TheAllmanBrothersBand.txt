26 ContributorsRamblinâ€™ Man Lyrics[Chorus]
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

[Verse 1]
Well, my father was a gambler down in Georgia
And he wound up on the wrong end of a gun
And I was born in the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Rollin' down Highway 41

[Chorus]
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

[Interlude]
All right

[Verse 2]
I'm on my way to New Orleans this mornin'
Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee
They're always having a good time down on the bayou, Lord
And Delta women think the world of me
You might also like[Chorus]
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

[Outro]
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man6Embed
