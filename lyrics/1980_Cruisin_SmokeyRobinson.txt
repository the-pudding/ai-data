(Cruisin')

[Verse 1]
Baby, let's cruise, away from here
Don't be confused, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it, forever
This is not a one night stand, baby, yeah so

Let the music take your mind, ooh

And inch by inch, we get closer and closer
To every little part of each other, ooh baby, yeah
