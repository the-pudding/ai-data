16 ContributorsThat’s the Way I’ve Always Heard It Should Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark
The living room is still
I walk by, no remark

[Verse 2]
I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines
I hear her call sweet dreams
But I forget how to dream

[Chorus]
But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own, you and me
Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me
We'll marry

[Verse 3]
My friends from college, they're all married now
They have their houses and their lawns
They have their silent noons
Tearful nights, angry dawns

[Verse 4]
Their children hate them for the things they're not
They hate themselves for what they are
And yet they drink, they laugh
Close the wound, hide the scar
You might also like[Chorus]
But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own, you and me
Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me
We'll marry

[Verse 5]
You say that we can keep our love alive
Babe, all I know is what I see
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris

[Verse 6]
You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf
I'll never learn to be just me first
By myself

[Chorus]
Well okay, it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own, you and me
Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me
We'll marry (Marry)1Embed
