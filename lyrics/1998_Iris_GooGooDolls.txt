And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now

[Verse 2]
And all I could taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

[Chorus]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Outro]
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am118Embed
