8 ContributorsChurch of the Poison Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Desolate loving in your eyes
You used an' made my life so sweet
Step out like a God-found child
I saw your eyes across the street

[Pre-Chorus]
Who would be the fool to take you
Be more than just kind?
Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find

[Chorus]
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
(In the church of the poison)

[Verse 2]
Watch me clinging to the beat
I had to fight to make it mine
That religion, you could sink it neat
Just move your feet an' you'll feel fine
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Who would be the fool to maybe
Trick a kiss in time?
Who am I to say that's crazy?
Love will make you blind

[Chorus]
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
(In the church of the poison mind)

[Bridge]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Desolate loving in your eyes
You used an' made my life so sweet
Step out like a God-found child
I saw your eyes across the street
[Pre-Chorus]
Who would be the fool to take you
Be more than just kind?
Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find

[Chorus]
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind1Embed
