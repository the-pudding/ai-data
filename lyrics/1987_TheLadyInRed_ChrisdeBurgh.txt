25 ContributorsThe Lady in Red Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright, mhm hm
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

[Chorus]
The lady in red is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

[Verse 2]
I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The lady in red is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
Well, I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

[Outro]
I never will forget the way you look tonight
The lady in red
The lady in red
The lady in red
My lady in red
I love you11Embed
