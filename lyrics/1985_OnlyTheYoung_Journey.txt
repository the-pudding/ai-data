Another night in any town
You can hear the thunder of their cry
Ahead of their time
They wonder why
In the shadows of a golden age
A generation waits for dawn
Brave carry on
Bold and the strong

[Chorus]
Only the young can say
They're free to fly away
Sharing the same desires
Burning like wildfire

[Verse 2]
They are seeing through the promises
And all the lies they dare to tell
Is it heaven or hell?
They know very well

[Chorus]
Only the young can say
They're free to fly away
Sharing the same desires
Burning like wildfire

They're free to fly away
Sharing the same desires
Burning like wildfire

[Outro]
Only the young can say
Only the young can say (Young can say)
Only the young can say
Only the young can say (Young can say)
