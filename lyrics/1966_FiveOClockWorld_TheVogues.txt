5 ContributorsFive Oâ€™Clock World Lyrics[Verse 1]
Up every morning just to keep a job
I gotta fight my way through the hustling mob
Sounds of the city poundin' in my brain
While another day goes down the drain
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
But it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows
No one owns a piece of my time
And there's a five o'clock me inside my clothes
Thinkin' that the world looks fine, yeah
Oh my lady, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tradin' my time for the pay I get
Livin' on money that I ain't made yet
I've been goin' tryin' to make my way
But I live for the end of the day
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows
No one owns a piece of my time
And there's a long-haired girl who waits, I know
To ease my troubled mind, yeah
Oh my lady, yeah
You might also like[Verse 3]
In the shelter of her arms everything's okay
When she talks, then the world goes slippin' away
And I know the reason I can still go on
When every other reason is gone
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
In my five o'clock world, she waits for me
Nothing else matters at all
'Cause every time my baby smiles at me
I know that's it's all worthwhile, yeah
Oh my lady, yeah
Oh my lady, yeah
Oh my lady, yeahEmbed
