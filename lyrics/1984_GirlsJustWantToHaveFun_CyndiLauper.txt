I come home in the mornin' light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh, mama dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[Verse 2]
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

[Chorus]
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the workin' day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

[Post-Chorus]
Girls, they want, wanna have fun
Girls, wanna have

[Verse 3]
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have
