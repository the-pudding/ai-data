20 ContributorsNothin’ But a Good Time Lyrics[Intro]
Woo, mm, yeah
Hahahaha
Hoo, yow
Woo, hahaha, yeah
Now listen

[Verse 1]
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night, I'd like to make my girl
But right now, I can't make ends meet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from the same ol', same ol'
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think, this is what I'd say

[Chorus]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

[Verse 2]
Say I spend my money on women and wine
But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
I'm real sorry 'bout the shape I'm in
I just like my fun every now and then
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from the same ol', same ol'
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think, this is what I'd say

[Chorus]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

[Bridge]
You see I
I raise a toast to all of us
Who are breakin' our backs every day
If wanting a good life is such a crime
Lord, then, put me away, yeah, here's to ya

[Guitar Solo]
Mm, guitar

[Chorus]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
[Outro]
It don’t get better, babyEmbed
