From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

[Chorus 1]
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

[Verse 2]
From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

[Chorus 2]
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They are the songs of every man

[Refrain]
God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
You might also like[Verse 3]
From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for

[Chorus 3]
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
This is the song of every man

[Refrain]
And God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
Oh, God is watching us, God is watching
God is watching us from a distance3Embed
