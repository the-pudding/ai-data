5 ContributorsQuarter to Three Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ah, don't you know that I danced, I danced 'til quarter to three
Ah, with the help, last night, from Daddy G
He was swingin on the sax with a girl or two
And I was dancin' all over the room

[Verse 2]
Oh, don't you know the people were dancin' like they were mad
It was the swingin'est band they had, ever heard
And swingin'est song that could ever be
It was the night with Daddy G

[Chorus]
Ah, let me tell you that I never had it so good
Yeah, and I know you never could
Until you get hip with that jive
And take a band like the Church Street Five

[Verse 3]
Don't you know that I danced, I danced 'til quarter to three
Ah, with the help last night from Daddy G
Ev'rybody was as happy as they could be
But they was swingin' with Daddy G, blow, Daddy!

[Saxophone Solo]
Ah, blow, blow, yeah
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yeah
A just a little bit of soul now
Ah, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Let me tell you that I never had it so good
Yeah, and I know you never could
Until you get hip with that jive
And take a band like the Church Street Five

[Verse 4]
Don't you know that I danced, I danced 'til quarter to three
Ah, with the help last night from Daddy G
Ev'rybody was happy as they could be
'Cause they were swingin' with Daddy G, ah blow, Daddy!

[Outro]
Ah, blow, blow, Daddy!
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Well, c'mon, c'mon
Blow, Daddy! yeah
C'mon, yeah, alright, yeahEmbed
