Like a moth to a flame, burned by the fire
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?
That's the way love goes
That's the way love
That's the way love
That's the way love goes
Like a moth to a flame, burned by the fire (That's the way)
My love is blind, can't you see my desire? (That's the way)
Like a moth to a flame, burned by the fire (That's the way)
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?
That's the way love goes
Like a moth to a flame, burned by the fire
That's the way, that's the way
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?
That's the way, that's the way
That's the way love goes

[Verse 1]
Come with me, don't you worry
I'm gonna make you crazy
I'll give you the time of your life
I'm gonna take you places
You've never been before and
You'll be so happy that you came
Ooh, I'm gonna take you there, ooh

[Verse 2]
Don't mind if I light candles, I like to watch us play and
Baby, I've got on what you like
Come closer, baby, closer, reach out and feel my body
I'm gonna give you all my love (That's the way love goes)
Oh, sugar don't you hurry, you've got me here all night
Just close your eyes and hold on tight (That's the way, that's the way)
Ooh, baby, don't stop, don't stop, go deeper, baby, deeper
You feel so good I'm gonna cry
Oh, I'm gonna take you there, ooh

[Chorus]
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes (That's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes (That's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes (Don't you know? Oh, that's the way)

[Interlude]
Like a moth to a flame, burned by the fire
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?
Like a moth to a flame, burned by the fire
My love is blind, can't you see my desire?
