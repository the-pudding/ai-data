24 ContributorsI’ll Make Love to You Lyrics[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
Close your eyes, make a wish
And blow out the candlelight
For tonight is just your night
We're gonna celebrate, all through the night

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Pour the wine, light the fire
Girl, your wish is my command
I submit to your demands
I will do anything, girl, you need only ask

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Til you tell me to

[Verse 3: Wanyá Morris]
Girl, relax, let's go slow
I ain't got nowhere to go
I'm just gonna concentrate on you
Girl, are you ready? It's gonna be a long night
Throw your clothes (Throw your clothes)
On the floor (On the floor)

I've made plans to be within you
Girl, whatever you ask me, you know, I could do

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Til you tell me to

[Bridge: Wanyá Morris]
Baby, tonight is your night
And I will do you right
Just make a wish on your night
Anything that you ask
I will give you the love of your life, your life, your life

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
I'll make love to you (I'll make love)
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight (Hold you tight)
