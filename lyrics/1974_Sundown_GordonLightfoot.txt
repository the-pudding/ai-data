I can see her lyin' back in her satin dress
In a room where you do what you don't confess

[Chorus]
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs

[Verse 2]
She's been lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream
And she don't always say what she really means

[Chorus]
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain

[Verse 3]
I can picture every move that a man could make
Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake

[Chorus]
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again

[Verse 4]
I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean

[Chorus]
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again4Embed
