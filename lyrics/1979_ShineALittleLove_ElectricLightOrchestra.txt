18 ContributorsShine a Little Love Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Although the things you've done, I wouldn't criticize
I guess you had your way
You see, I've gotta make you understand

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say
But it don't matter, baby
'Cause today's another day

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

[Verse 2]
Remember, tonight we're gonna run 'til dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say
We'll never stop, we got a good thing goin' on

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you've heard it all before
But I really need you, darlin'
Every day, I need you more
You might also like[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

[Bridge]
Can you understand? (Yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right? (I know it is)
Will you be the same? (I'll do it all again)

[Verse 3]
It's been a year now and it's gettin' so much better
Came home without a word
Though everybody said, "You'll soon forget her"

[Pre-Chorus]
They couldn't see and they just didn't understand
And lookin' in the mirror
There were fools at either hand

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see
[Bridge]
Can you understand? (Yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right? (I know it is)
Will you be the same? (I'll do it all again)

[Verse 4]
How many days have I
Been waitin' there to tell you?
I really can't believe
We're walkin' out into the world tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll do it all again until the break of light
And the feeling in your heart
Will soon be shinin' in your eyes

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life
(Shine on me)
You shine a little love on my life
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see
[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life (Shi-i-ine)
You shine a little love on my life (E.L.O.)
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see
