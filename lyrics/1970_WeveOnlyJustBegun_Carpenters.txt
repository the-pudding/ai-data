20 ContributorsWeâ€™ve Only Just Begun Lyrics[Verse 1]
We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
We've only begun
Before the rising sun, we fly
So many roads to choose
We start out walking and learn to run
And yes, we've just begun

[Chorus]
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talkin' it over, just the two of us
Workin' together day to day, together

[Verse 2]
And when the evening comes, we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun

[Chorus]
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talkin' it over, just the two of us
Workin' together day to day, together, together

And when the evening comes, we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun8Embed
