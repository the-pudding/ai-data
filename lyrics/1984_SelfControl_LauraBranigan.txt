Oh, the night is my world
City light painted girl
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
In the night, no control
Through the wall something's breaking
Wearing white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes, the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control
Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You help me to forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control

[Chorus]
I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes
A safe night
(You take my self, you take my self control)
I'm living in the forest of a dream
(You take my self, you take my self control)
I know the night is not as it would seem
(You take my self, you take my self control)
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
(You take my self, you take my self control)
This night will never go
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Oh, the night is my world
City light painted girl
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters

[Chorus]
I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never knows
A safe night
(You take my self, you take my self control)
I'm living in the forest of a dream
(You take my self, you take my self control)
I know the night is not as it would seem
(You take my self, you take my self control)
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
(You take my self, you take my self control)
This night will never go
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You take my self, you take my self control (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You take my self, you take my self control (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You take my self, you take my self control (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You take my self, you take my self control (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You take my self, you take my self control (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You take my self, you take my self control (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You take my self, you take my self control (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You take my self, you take my self control (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)21Embed
