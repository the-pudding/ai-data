Ay, ay, ay
Nobody likes being played

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Oh, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Oh, Shakira, Shakira (Hey)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé & Shakira]
He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about
He kissed me, his one and only (Yes), beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things I just found out about

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira & Beyoncé]
You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry (Ay)

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Shakira & Both]
Let's not kill the karma (Ay)
Let's not start a fight (Ay)
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar (Oh)
Can't we laugh about it? (Ha, ha, ha; oh)
It's not worth our time (Oh)
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
I didn't know about you then 'til I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancin'
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira & Beyoncé]
We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone (Ay)

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Shakira & Both]
Let's not kill the karma (Ay)
Let's not start a fight (Ay)
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar (Oh)
Can't we laugh about it? (Ha, ha, ha; oh)
It's not worth our time (Oh)
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

[Bridge: Shakira, Beyoncé & Both]
Tell me how to forgive you (Ooh)
When it's me who's ashamed (Oh, ayy)
And I wish could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame (Hey)
[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Ay, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Ay, Shakira, Shakira
Oh, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Oh, Shakira, Shakira (Hey, ay)

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Shakira & Both]
Let's not kill the karma (Ay)
Let's not start a fight (Ay)
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar (Oh)
Can't we laugh about it? (Ha, ha, ha; oh)
It's not worth our time (Oh)
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar20Embed
