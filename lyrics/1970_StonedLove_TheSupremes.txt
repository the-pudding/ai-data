10 ContributorsStoned Love Lyrics[Intro]
Now I wanna tell you of a great love
Oh, it will light up
It will surely light up
Darkened worlds
If you'll just believe
Stone love

[Chorus]
(Stone love)
Mm-hmm
Mm-hmm
Stone love
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
A love for each other will bring fighting to an end
Forgiving one another, time after time, doubt creeps in
But like the sun lights up the sky with a message from above
Oh, yeah, I find no other greater symbol of love

[Chorus]
Yeah, don't you hear the wind blowin'?
Mm-hmm
Stone love, oh, yeah
I tell you, I ain't got no other
Mm-hmm
Stone love, oh, yeah
You might also like[Verse 2]
Life is so short, put the present time at hand (Say it like it is)
Oh, yeah, and if you're young at heart, rise up and take your stand (Say it like it is)
And to the man on whose shoulder the world must depend (Say it, say it, say it like it is)
I pray for peace and love, amen

[Chorus]
Ooh, can't you feel it?
Stone love
I tell you, I ain't got no other
Uh-huh
Stone love, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 3]
If a war 'tween our nations passed, oh, yeah (War, war, baby, baby)
Will the love 'tween our brothers and sisters last? (Love, love)
On and on and on and on and

[Chorus]
Mm, mm, mm
Stone love, yeah
I tell you, I ain't got no other
Mm-hmm
Stone love
Can't you, can't you, can't you, can't you, can't you feel it?
Mm-hmm
Stone love
Oh, yeah, stone, stone, stone, stone
Mm-hmm
Stone love

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh
Stone love
Oh, yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Mm-hmm
Stone loveEmbed
