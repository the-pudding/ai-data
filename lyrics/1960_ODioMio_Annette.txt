Please let him know
How much I need him
How much I want him
How much I long for his love

O Dio Mio
Please hear my prayer
O Dio Mio
Please make him care
If he would love me
I'd be in Heaven above
Heaven above

Each time I hear
The church bells chime
I dream I'm his
And he is mine

O Dio Mio
I love him so
O Dio Mio
Please let him know
How much I need him
How much I long for his love
Make him my love
