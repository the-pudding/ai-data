Hey, Venus!
Oh, Venus!

[Verse]
Venus, if you will
Please, send a little girl for me to thrill
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms
A girl with all the charms of you
Venus, make her fair
A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
And take the brightest stars up in the skies
And place them in her eyes for me

[Chorus]
Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely, the things I ask
Can't be too great a task

[Post-Chorus]
Venus, if you do
I promise that I always will be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall live

[Chorus]
Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely, the things I ask
Can't be too great a task

[Outro]
Hey, Venus!
Oh, Venus!
Make my wish come trueEmbed
