There was a time when I was
In a hurry as you are
I was like you
There was a day when I just
Had to tell my point of view
I was like you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I don't mean to make you frown
No, I just want you to slow down

[Chorus]
Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried
To find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy
Just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?

[Verse 2]
Running around as you do
With your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back
Kick your shoes off, close your eyes
I was like you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're not hard to understand
You need someone to take your hand

[Chorus]
Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried
To find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy
Just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?Embed
