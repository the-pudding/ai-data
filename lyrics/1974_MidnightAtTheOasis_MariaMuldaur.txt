13 ContributorsMidnight at the Oasis Lyrics[Verse 1]
Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Shadows painting our faces
Traces of romance in our heads
Heaven's holding a half moon
Shining just for us
Let's slip off to
A sand dune, real soon
And kick up a little dust

[Chorus]
Come on, cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on, 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends

[Verse 2]
You don't have to answer
There's no need to speak
I'll be your belly dancer, prancer
And you can be my sheik

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I know your daddy's a sultan
A nomad known to all
With fifty girls to attend him
They all send him
Jump at his beck and call
You might also likeBut you won't need no harem, honey
When I'm by your side
And you won't need no camel, no no
When I take you for a ride

[Chorus]
Come on, cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on, 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends

[Verse 4]
Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Got shadows painting our faces
And traces of romance in our heads

[Outro]
Oh come on, oh come on
Woo hoo hoo, yeah, oh yeah1Embed
