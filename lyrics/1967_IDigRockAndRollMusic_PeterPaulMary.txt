I dig rock and roll music
And I love to get the chance to play (And sing it)
I figure it's about the happiest sound
Goin' down today
The message may not move me
Or mean a great deal to me
But hey, it feels
So groovy to say

[Verse 2]
I dig the Mamas and the Papas at "The Trip"
Sunset Strip in L.A.Â 
And they got (They got) a good thing goin'
When the words don't get in the way, yeah
And when they're really wailing
Michelle and Cass are sailin'
Hey, they really nail
Me to the wall, yeah

[Verse 3]
Donovan kind of in
A dream-like, tripped-out way
His crystal images hey
Tell you 'bout a brighter day
And when the Beatles tell you (Beatles tell you)
They've got a word "love" to sell you (All in love)
They mean exactly (Exactly)
What they say
You might also like[Verse 4]
I dig, ho ho, rock and roll music
I could really get it on in that scene
I think I could say somethin'
If you know what I mean
But if I really say it
The radio won't play it
Unless I lay it
Between the linesEmbed
