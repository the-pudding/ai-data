6 ContributorsLovers Who Wander LyricsWhen she kissed me, I was born and she said goodbye
And I knew right away I was born to cry
Now I'm happy and the joke's on her
'Cause I found that place for lovers who wander, yeah

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dum dum da da, dum dum da da, dum dum da da la, la, la, la

She took my love, says she's not coming back
So my world and my sky was all turning black
Now I see the light, I'm wise to her
'Cause I found that place for lovers who wander, yeah

Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dum dum diddle diddle
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dum dum diddle diddle
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dum dum diddle diddle
Dum diddledy dum diddledy da, la, la, la, la

A-walking around thinking about her
Never thought I could do without her
She broke my heart, I really showed it
Look at me now, you'd never know it

Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
All my love and dreams have gone for her
'Cause I found that place for lovers who wander, yeah
