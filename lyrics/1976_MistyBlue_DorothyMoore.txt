8 ContributorsMisty Blue Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off my mind
Oh, but I can't
Just the thought of you (Just the thought of you)
Turns my whole world misty blue (Misty blue)

[Verse 2]
Oh honey, just the mention of your name (Just your name)
Turns the flicker to a flame
Listen to me good, baby
I think of the things we used to do
And my whole world turns misty blue (Misty blue)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh baby, I should forget you
Heaven knows I've tried (You know I've tried)
Baby, when I say that I'm glad we're through
Deep in my heart I know I've lied
I've lied, I've lied
Ooh (Just the thought of you, misty blue)

[Verse 3]
Oh honey, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off my mind
But I can't
Just the thought of you, my love (Just the thought of you)
My whole world turns misty blue (Misty blue)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, I can't, oh, I can't
Oh, I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blue (Misty blue)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my love
My whole world turns misty blue (Misty blue)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blueEmbed
