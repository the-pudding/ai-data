6 ContributorsYou Wonâ€™t See Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind, if you won't see me
You won't see me

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you (Ooh) should want to hide (Ooh)
But I can't get through (Ooh), my hands are tied (Ooh)
I won't want to stay (Ooh), I don't have much to say (Ooh)
But I can turn away (Ooh) if you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me

[Chorus]
Time after time (Ooh) you refuse to even (Ooh) listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'

[Post-Chorus]
Though the days (Though the days) are few (Days are few), they're filled (They're just filled) with tears
And since I (And since I) lost you (I lost you), it feels (It just feels) like years
Yes, it seems so long (Ooh) since you've been gone (Ooh)
And I just can't (And I can't) go on (Can't go on), if you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me

[Chorus]
Time after time (Ooh) you refuse to even (Ooh) listen
I wouldn't (I wouldn't) mind if I knew (If I) what I was missin' (I was missin')

Though the days (Though the days) are few (Are few), they're filled with tears (Doo doo doo doo)
And since I (And since I) lost you (Lost you), it feels like years (Doo doo doo doo)
Yes, it seems (Seems) so long since you've been gone
And I just can't (And I can't) go (Go) on, if you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me

[Outro]
