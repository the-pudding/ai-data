10 ContributorsPenny Lover Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Penny lover, don't walk on by
Penny lover, don't you make me cry
Can't you see, girl, who my heart's beating for?
You're the only girl that I adore

[Verse 1]
The first time I saw you
Oh, you looked so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine
Honey, you came along and captured my heart
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
Girl, a love like yours is hard to resist, oh

[Chorus 2]
Penny lover, my love's on fire
Penny lover, you're my one desire
Tell me, baby, could this be true?
That I could need someone like I need you?

[Verse 2]
Nights warm and tender
Lying next to you
Girl, I surrender
What more can I do?
I've spent all of my life in search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl, I'll do anything, just please stay, oh

I don't understand it, oh, what's come over me?
But I'm not gonna worry, no, not anymore
'Cause when a man's in love, he's only got one story
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
With a love like yours, it's hard to resist, oh
(I'm gonna say this again)

[Chorus 3]
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (Don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (Don't you make me cry, baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (Don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (Oh, penny baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (Don't you walk on by)

[Outro]
I remember the first time I saw you baby
Penny lover, don't you make me cry
You had the look in your eye, you had the look in your eye, yeah, yeah
Ooh, pretty baby
I just wanted to reach out and touch you, baby
I wanna reach out and hold you, I wanna reach out and say ooh
Woah, oh no, now
Don't make me cry
I wanna talk about you every day (Penny lover)
Need you, baby (Ooh), need you, baby
Oh, penny (Penny lover, ooh)
Oh, penny baby
Can't you see I need you, baby? (Penny lover, ooh)
Don't you walk on by, ooh (Penny lover, ooh)
Can't you see that I need you, baby?
My penny (Penny lover, ooh)
Don't you walk on by, oh, oh, penny
My baby
Don't you walk on byEmbed
