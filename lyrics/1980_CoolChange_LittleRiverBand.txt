5 ContributorsCool Change Lyrics[Verse 1]
If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

[Verse 2]
There's lots of those friendly people
They're showing me ways to go
But I never want to lose their inspiration

[Chorus]
Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
And now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

[Verse 3]
Well, I was born in the sign of water
And it's there that I feel my best
The albatross and the whales, they are my brothers

[Verse 4]
It's kind of a special feeling
When you're out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

[Bridge]
I've never been romantic
And sometimes I don't care
I know it may sound selfish
But let me breathe the air
Yeah, yeah
Let me breathe the air

[Verse 1]
If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

[Verse 4]
It's kind of a special feeling
Out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

[Chorus]
Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool, cool, cool change
[Outro]
(Time for a cool change)
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
For a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Ooh, I know it's time for a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Now that my life is so prearranged
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
(Time for a cool change)
It's time for a cool change
Yes it is, yes it is, yes it is
You know it's time for a cool changeEmbed
