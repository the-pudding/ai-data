3 ContributorsA Must to Avoid Lyrics[Chorus]
She's a must to avoid
A complete impossibility
She's a must to avoid
Better take it from me

You'll think she's a prize at the start
But take my advice, play it smart
She's nothin' but trouble
Better cut out on the double
Before she gets into your heart

[Chorus]
When you stare into her pretty blue eyes
There's no way to see through her disguise
But don't try to love her 'cause you'll quickly discover
You're trapped in the web of her lies

[Chorus]
Her lips look inviting it's true
But lots of other guys have felt like you do
She'll build up your hopes and when you need her the most
That's when she'll say goodbye to you
