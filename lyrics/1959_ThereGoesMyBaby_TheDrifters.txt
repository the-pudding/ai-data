There goes my baby
Movin' on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where
Wonder where she is bound?

I broke her heart
And made her cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do? What can I do?

(There goes my baby) Whoa
(There goes my baby) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(There goes my baby) Whoa
(There she goes) Yeah (There she goes)

I wanna know if she loved me
Did she really love me?
Was she just playing
Me for a fool?
