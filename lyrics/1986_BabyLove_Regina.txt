5 ContributorsBaby Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Boy, there's no one home tonight
The timing could be right to forget the rules
We're out of school until tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Now, if only you would stay
There's so many games we'd play
Why should we pretend to be just friends
When we could be so much more?

[Chorus]
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call it)
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call it)

[Verse 3]
Words don't mean so much to me
I'd rather wait and see, see what happens
When the lights go down with your arms around me

[Verse 4]
Time to leave the world behind
Save it for another time
'Cause I don't remember where I am
When you start to love me (love me)
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call it)
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call it)

[Bridge:]
Ooh, baby, baby love
Ooh, sweet and tasty
Baby, baby love
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 5]
Boy, I want you by my side
There's no reason we should hide how we feel
When we are near each other, undercover

[Verse 6]
Warm, I hold you close to me
You're perfection, first degree
'Cause I don't remember where I am
When you start to move me (move me)

[Chorus]
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call it)
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call it)
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call it)
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (baby love)

Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call it)
Baby love (you are my)
Baby love (just call it)Embed
