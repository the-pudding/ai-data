You always make me smile when I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe, it's totally bonafide, mm
It's not the way you walk and it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got, that keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]
(Your love, it feels so good) And that's what takes me high
(Higher than I've been before) Your love, it keeps me alive
(Thought I should let you know) That your touch, it means so much
(When I'm alone at night) It's you I'm always thinking of, ooh, oh, baby

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I want you to understand
How I feel, yeah, deep inside
Oh-ho, you make me feel
What I need to feel, yes, in my heart

[Chorus]
(Your love, it feels so good) And that's what takes me high
(Higher than I've been before) Your love, it keeps me alive
(Thought I should let you know) That your touch, it means so much
(When I'm alone at night) It's you I'm always thinking of, ooh, oh, baby
