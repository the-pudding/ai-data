Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

[Verse 2]
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
See Journey LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like[Verse 4]
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people115Embed
