12 ContributorsWhoâ€™s Making Love Lyrics[Intro]
Ow
Hear me now

[Verse 1]
All you fellows, gather round me and let me give you some good advice
What I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask you now, you'd better think about it twice

[Pre-Chorus]
While you're lyin, cheatin' on your woman, there is something you never even thought of

[Chorus]
Now, tell me, who's makin' love to your old lady while you were out makin' love?
Hear me now, now, who's makin' love to your old lady while you were out makin' love?

[Verse 2]
I've seen so, so many fellows all in that same old bag
Thinkin' that a woman is made to, to be beat on and treated so bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, fellows, let me ask you somethin' I'm sure that you never even dreamed of

[Chorus]
Now, tell me, who's makin' love to your old lady while you were out makin' love?
Oh, who's makin' love to your old lady while you were out makin' love?

I know there are some women guilty of this too
I'm not tryin' to run your life, choice is up to you
Oh, you, oh, oh, you, you and you

[Verse 3]
The reason why I ask these questions, I used to be the same old way
When I decided to straighten up, I found it was a bit too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, yeah, that's when it all happened, something I never, never dreamed of

[Chorus]
Somebody was lovin' my old lady while I was out makin' love
Somebody was lovin' my old lady while I was out makin' love

[Outro]
Listen now, now, who's making love to your old lady while you were out making love? OwEmbed
