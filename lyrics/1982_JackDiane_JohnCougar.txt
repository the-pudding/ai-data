Little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jackie gon' be a football star
Diane's debutante backseat of Jackie's car

[Verse 2]
Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jackie's lap, he's got his hands between her knees
Jackie say, "Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks slacks and do what I please"

[Chorus]
Say a, oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Say, oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
They walk on

[Verse 3]
Jackie sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
"Well then, there Diane, we oughta run off to the city"
Diane says, "Baby, you ain't missin' a thing"

[Chorus]
But Jacky say a, "Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone"
Oh yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

So let it rock, let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul
Holdin' on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon, make us women and men

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

[Outro]
A little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids doin' the best they can11Embed
