7 ContributorsItâ€™s Gonna Take a Miracle LyricsLoving you so
I was to blind to see
You letting me go
But now that you've set me free
It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Oh, didn't you know
It wouldn't be so easy?

Oh, though I know I can't
Forget about you

To show you how much
You're turning me around
Destroying me
