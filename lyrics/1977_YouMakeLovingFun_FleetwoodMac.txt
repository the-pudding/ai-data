32 ContributorsYou Make Loving Fun Lyrics[Verse 1: Christine McVie]
Sweet, wonderful you
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Don't, don't break the spell
It would be different and you know it will
You, you make loving fun
And I don't have to tell you, but you're the only one

You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)13Embed
