6 ContributorsPoint of No Return Lyrics[Verse 1]
The common road
Seems just like a dream
It's a mystery to me
It fills me within
When we're together
Oh, baby, can't you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return
I will be in full reaction
I'm gonna take you in my arms

[Chorus]
You're taking me
To the point of no return
Oh, oh, oh, you're taking me
To the point of no return
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
It took so long
But I treasure now
The love you gave to me
And when you smile
It warms my heart in me
Oh, baby, can't you see?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I, I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return
Oh, baby, I will be in full reaction
I wanna to take you in my arms

[Chorus]
You're taking me
To the point of no return (To the point of no return)
Oh, oh, oh, you're taking me
To the point of no return (Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
I wanna be with you, baby (Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)
I'm gonna be by your side (By your side)
I wanna be with you, baby (Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)
I'm gonna love you every night (Every night)

[Chorus]
You're taking me
To the point of no return (Hey, hey, hey)
Oh, oh, oh, you're taking me (Hey, hey, hey)
To the point of no return
(Come on and take me to the point)
(Come on and take me to the point)
Oh, oh, oh, you're taking me
To the point of no return
(No holding back, no, no holding back)
Oh, oh, oh, you're taking me
To the point of no return (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, you're taking me (Take-taking me)
To the point of no return
Oh, babyEmbed
