10 ContributorsGive Me Just One Night (Una Noche) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You keep telling me you want me
Hold me close all through the night
And I know, that deep inside, you need me
No one else can make it right
Don't you try to hide your secrets
I can see it in your eyes
You said the words without speaking
Now I'm gonna make you mine

[Chorus]
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
(The time of your life, ooh)
(I'll give you the time of your life)
(Oh baby, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Your rustic passion makes me crazy
Your existence makes me wild
I wanna loosen up your feelings
See what's hiding inside

[Chorus]
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche (Yeah)
I'll give you the time of your life
(The time of your life, oh, ooh yeah)
(Ooh baby)

Ay, que rico, me pone loca
Como te mueves, como me toca
Tu movimiento, tu sentimiento
Si yo te quiero, te doy la noche
Toda la noche, ay, vamos

[Chorus]
Give me just one night (Give me one night, baby)
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night (Oh, just for one night, oh baby)
I'll give you the time of your life (I'll give you the time of your life)
Give me just one night

[Chorus 2]
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side (A moment to be by your side)
Give me just one night, una noche (Oh yeah)
I'll give you the time of your life
(Come on come on come on now baby)

[Chorus]
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side (A moment to be by your side)
Give me just one night, una noche
(I'll give you the time of your life)
I'll give you the time of your life
(Time of your life)
Yeah, ooh yeah, oh
Ooh yeah2Embed
