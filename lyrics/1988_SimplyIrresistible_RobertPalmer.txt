7 ContributorsSimply Irresistible Lyrics[Verse 1]
How can it be permissible?
She compromise my principle, yeah, yeah
That kind of love is mythical
She's anything but typical

[Bridge]
She's a craze you'd endorse
She's a powerful force
You're obliged to conform
When there's no other course
She used to look good to me
But now I find her

[Chorus]
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible

[Verse 2]
Her loving is so powerful, huh!
It's simply unavoidable
The trend is irreversible
The woman is invincible

[Bridge]
She's a natural law
And she leaves me in awe
She deserves the applause
I surrender because
She used to look good to me
But now I find her
