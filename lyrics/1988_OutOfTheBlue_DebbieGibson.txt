6 ContributorsOut of the Blue Lyrics[Verse 1:]
Without you
Without you
I always thought that
Everything was fine
Without you
Never knowing you'd be mine

Suddenly my world has changed
And I just wonder why
All it took was just one smile

[Chorus:]
Now it's you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
Dream come true
I never thought I'd realize
What love was, what love was
What love was

[Verse 2:]
I need you, I need you
And every day I love you
More and more
Without you
I know what it's all for
You might also likeSuddenly I see you there
And everything's okay
Don't know why I feel this way

[Chorus:]
Now it's you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
Dream come true
I never thought I'd realize
What love was, what love was
What love was
Here with you

[Bridge:]
We are together now
Never take my heart away
All the love I found
Is here to stay
(out of the blue)

[Chorus 2:]
It's like a dream come true
I never thought
I'd fall in love with you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought
[Outro:]
Here with you
Out of the, out of the
Out of the clear blue
Oh, it's like a dream come true
I never thought
I never thought
Out of the blue
Before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought
I'd fall in love with you
Out of the, out of the
Out of the, out of the clear blueEmbed
