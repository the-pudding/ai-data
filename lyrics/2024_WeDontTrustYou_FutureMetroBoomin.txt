Fake written all over you
Hate written all over you
Hate written all over
Fake written all over you
Hate written all over you
Fake written all over you
Hate written all over you
Smiling faces
Sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces
Of the evil that lurks within (Can you dig it?)
Fake written all over you
Hater written all over you
Fake written all over you, yeah

[Verse 1: Future]
I been in the cold, couldn't feel my toes, but I still stuck to the code
Money won't fold, pockets won't hold enough
Takin' my pole in there, F&N in there
Take me anywhere, I'm takin' over the trap
I see the real clear, woodgrain Cartier
Poppin' a real pill, higher than Beverly Hills
I got too much spill, I give a bitch chills
Took out a small bill, make all the hoes strip
You need a weed feel, I get it vacuum sealed
Came from the Eastside, shooters on detail
Go purchase a new Chanel, I need a refill
Strikers in Trackhawks, ridin' the V12
I peeped the mood, dog, I peeped the intel
Get to trippin', all you gon' see is shells
You might also like[Chorus: Future, Joe Harris & 2Pac]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
We don't trust you niggas, we don't
(I don't trust no motherfuckin' body)
We don't trust you niggas, we don't
We don't trust you
We don't trust you niggas, we don't
We don't trust you niggas, we don't (Smiling faces)
We don't trust you niggas, we don't (Show no traces)
(Of the evil that lurks within)
We don't trust you

[Verse 2: Future]
You a nigga number-one fan, dog
Sneak dissin', I don't understand, dog
Pillowtalkin', actin' like a fed, dog
I don't need another fake friend, dog
Can't be 'bout a ho, 'cause we sharin', dog
In your feelings, nigga, why you playin', dog?
Give her backshots while she layin' down
Keep the Glock cocked, I don't trust hoes
Top shotter, goin' for the gusto
Like a real dog, got a mutt ho
Get the lo', you a John Doe
Bubble-eye Benz on a ho
Rappin' so pretend, you a ho
Nine-figure nigga, tag a toe
Ain't no tappin' in, better blow
Shorty poppin' pills, but he blessed
Flash a couple M's on my chest
Ain't no sabotagin', lil' finesse
We was in the field, placin' bets
Still gettin' chills in my flesh
Takin' karma, turn it to success
Thoroughbred and Pluto, nothin' less
Twenty drivers parked at the jet
Whip the Phantom to the projects
Death before dishonor, no confess
[Chorus: Future & Joe Harris]
We don't trust you niggas, we don't (Smiling faces)
We don't trust you niggas, we don't (Pretend to be your friend)
We don't trust you

[Outro: Future & Jason Mitchell]
We don't trust you, no, no, no
We don't trust you, no, no, no, no, no, no
We don't trust you, no, no, no
We don't trust you, no, no, no, no, no, no
We don't trust you, no, no, no
(Trust is a motherfucker)
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm—
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Hate written all over you
Fake written all over you
Hater written all over you
Fake written all over you, yeah
(Trust is a motherfucker)5Embed
