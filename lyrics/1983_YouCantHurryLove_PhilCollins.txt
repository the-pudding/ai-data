I need love, love, ooh, to ease my mind
And I need to find time, someone to call mine
My mama said

[Chorus]
"You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love (Hoo)
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in the good time
No matter how long it takes"

[Verse 1]
How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again?
Right now, the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone
I remember Mama said

[Chorus]
"(You can't hurry love)
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"
How long must I wait? (Hoo)
And how much more must I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I've grown impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well, these precious words keep me hanging on
I remember Mama said

[Chorus]
"(You can't hurry love)
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love (Hoo)
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes"
And now break!

[Bridge]
Now love, love, it don't come easy
But I keep on waiting, anticipating
For that soft voice to talk to me at night
For some tender arms, hold me tight
I keep waiting (Hoo)
'Til that day
But it ain't easy, no (Love don't come easy)
You know it ain't easy, my mama said
[Chorus]
"You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love (Hoo)
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait…"5Embed
