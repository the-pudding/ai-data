7 ContributorsSuddenly Last Summer Lyrics[Verse 1]
It happened one summer
It happened one time
It happened forever
For a short time
A place for a moment
An end to a dream
Forever I loved you
Forever it seemed

[Chorus]
One summer never ends
One summer never began
It keeps me standing still
It takes all my will
And then suddenly
Last summer

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I never leave
But sometimes I would
Sometimes I stay too long
Sometimes I would
Sometimes it frightens me
Sometimes it would
Sometimes I'm all alone
And wish that I could
You might also like[Chorus]
One summer never ends
One summer never begins
It keeps me standing still
It takes all my will
And then suddenly
Last summer
And then suddenly
Last summer

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
One summer never ends
One summer never begins
It keeps me standing still
It takes all my will
And then suddenly
Last summer
And then suddenly
Last summer
Until suddenly
Last Summer

[Outro]
And then suddenly
Last summer
Until suddenly
Last Summer
It happened suddenly
Last summerEmbed
