45 ContributorsElectric Avenue Lyrics[Intro]
Oi
Oi

[Verse 1]
Now in the street, there is violence
And a lots of work to be done
No place to hang out the washing
And I can't blame all on the sun, oh no

[Chorus]
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Verse 2]
Working so hard like a soldier
Can't afford a thing on TV
Deep in my heart, I abhor ya
Can't get food for the kid, good God

[Chorus]
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Ho, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, Lord

[Chorus]
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Ho, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Verse 3]
Who is to blame in one country?
Never can get to the one
Dealing in multiplication
And they still can't feed everyone, oh no

[Chorus]
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Ho no, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Bridge]
Ho, out in the street
Out in the street
Out in the daytime
Out in the night
[Chorus]
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Ho, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Bridge]
Out in the street
Out in the street
Out in the playground
In the dark side of town

[Chorus]
Ho, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Hey, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue (Oh, yeah)
And then we'll take it higher

[Outro]
Rock it in the daytime (Electric Avenue)
Rock it in the night (Electric Avenue)
Rock it in Miami mama, meh (Electric Avenue)
Whoa, in a Brixton (Electric Avenue)7Embed
