I ain't worried about nothin', I ain't wearin' na-nada
I'm sittin' pretty, impatient, but I know you gotta
Put in them hours, I'ma make it harder
I'm sendin' pic after picture, I'ma get you fired

[Pre-Chorus: Normani, Dinah]
I know you're always on the night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone (Oh-oh)
And I don't need no explanation
'Cause, baby, you're the boss at home

[Chorus: Lauren]
You don't gotta go to work
Work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work
Work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work
Work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work
Work, work, work, work, work, work
We can work from home, oh-oh, oh-oh
We can work from home, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Ally, Ally & Dinah]
Let's put it into motion, I'ma give you a promotion
I'll make it feel like a vacay, turn the bed into an ocean
We don't need nobody, I just need your body
Nothing but sheets in-between us, ain't no getting off early
