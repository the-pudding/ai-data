10 ContributorsHow Can We Be Lovers Lyrics[Intro]
How can we be lovers if we can't be friends?
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby?
How can we make love if we can't make amends?
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends?

[Verse 1]
Look at us now, look at us, baby
Still trying to work it out, never get it right
We must be fools, we must be crazy
Oh, when there's no communication
Oh, it's a no-win situation

[Chorus]
How can we be lovers if we can't be friends?
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby?
How can we make love if we can't make amends? Tell me
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends?

[Verse 2]
We lie awake, this wall between us
We're just not talking, we've got so much to say
Let's break these chains, our love can free us
Oh, ain't it time we started trying?
Oh, gotta stop this love from dying
