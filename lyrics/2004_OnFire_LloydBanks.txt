36 ContributorsOn Fire Lyrics[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
New York City (Hunger for More!)
You are now rockin' with the best
Lloyd Banks
G-Unit!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks & 50 Cent]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin' hot
We on fire
Shorty take it off, if it get too hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Uh
Nigga, what you say?
We gettin' loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire (Right)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Nah, I ain't puttin' nuttin' out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This hit gon' last for the whole summer
Runnin' your bitch faster than the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rose gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buyin' diamonds by the pair
But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin' is your hair, yea
I'm ridin' with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
A ladies man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention the boy pack clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists gettin' wrong deals
I'm only 21, sittin' on mills
You might also like[Chorus: Lloyd Banks & 50 Cent]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin' hot
We on fire
Shorty take it off, if it get too hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Uh
Nigga, what you say?
We gettin' loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire (Uh)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
If you know anything about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I don't hit the first night, I ain't gon' call her
I'm tryin' to play, you tryna have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care about what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't puttin' no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread but I ain't spending a quarter
So cut the games ma, let's go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass 'round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm ridin' through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when, I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife, beater
Regular chick or R&B, diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind, reader
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks & 50 Cent]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin' hot
We on fire
Shorty take it off, if it get too hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Uh
Nigga, what you say?
We gettin' loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire9Embed
