6 ContributorsWho Will You Run To Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're not sure what you wanna do with your life
But you sure don't want me in it
Yeah, you're sure the life you're living with me
Can't go on one single minute
And there's a new one waitin' outside this door
Now it's time to begin it

[Pre-Chorus]
You found a new world and you wanna taste it
But that world can turn cold
And you better face it

[Chorus]
Who will you run to when it all falls down?
Who's gonna pick your world up off of the ground?
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry?
Who's gonna love you, baby, as good as I?

[Verse 2]
You don't know what it's like to live on your own
You've always had me there beside you
You think it's easy finding someone out there
Who's gonna care as much as I do
What's gonna happen, baby, when you find out
There's no one there to cry to?

You can tell the whole world how you're gonna make it
You can follow your heart
What would you do when someone breaks it?

[Chorus]
Who will you run to when it all falls down?
Who's gonna pick your world up off of the ground?
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry?
Who's gonna love you, baby, as good as I?

[Pre-Chorus]
You found a new world and you wanna taste it
But that world can turn cold
And you better face it

[Chorus]
Who will you run to when it all falls down?
Who's gonna pick your world up off of the ground?
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry?
Who's gonna love you, baby, as good as I?
Who will you run to when it all falls down? (Who will you run to?)
Who's gonna pick your world up off of the ground?
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry?
Who's gonna love you, baby, as good as I?Embed
