2 ContributorsBlame It on the Bossa Nova Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was at a dance when he caught my eye
Standin' all alone lookin' sad and shy
We began to dance, swayin' to and fro
And soon I knew I'd never let him go

[Pre-Chorus]
Blame it on the Bossa Nova with its magic spell
Blame it on the Bossa Nova that he did so well
Oh, it all began with just one little dance
But soon it ended up a big romance
Blame it on the Bossa Nova, the dance of love

[Chorus]
(Now, was it the moon?)
No, no, the Bossa Nova
(Or the stars above?)
No, no, the Bossa Nova
(Now, was it the tune?)
Yeah, yeah, the Bossa Nova
(The dance of love)

[Organ Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm glad to say I'm his bride-to-be
And we're gonna raise a family
And when our kids ask how it came about
And I'm gonna say to them without a doubt

(Now, was it the moon?)
No, no, the Bossa Nova
