The beat goes on
The beat goes on

[Verse 1: Cher, Sonny]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-di-da-di-di
La-di-da-di-da
The Charleston was once the rage, uh-huh
History has turned a page, uh-huh
The miniskirt's the current thing, uh-huh
The teenybopper is our newborn king, uh-huh

[Chorus: Sonny]
And the beat goes on
The beat goes on

[Verse 2: Cher, Sonny]
The drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-di-da-di-di
La-di-da-di-da
The grocery store's the super-mart, uh-huh
Little girls still break their hearts, uh-huh
And men still keep on marching off to war
Electrically, they keep a baseball score
You might also like[Chorus: Sonny]
And the beat goes on
The beat goes on

[Verse 3: Cher, Sonny]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-di-da-di-di
La-di-da-di-da
Grandmas sit in chairs and reminisce
Boys keep chasing girls to get a kiss
The cars keep a-going faster all the time
Bum still cries, "Hey, buddy, have you got a dime?"

[Chorus: Sonny]
And the beat goes on
The beat goes on

[Post-Chorus: Cher]
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-di-da-di-di
La-di-da-di-da

[Outro: Sonny (Cher)]
And the beat goes on (Yes, the beat goes on)
And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on, on, on, on, on)
The beat goes on
And the beat goes on (On, on, on, on)
The beat goes...Embed
