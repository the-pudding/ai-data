1 ContributorFulldive Lyrics[Intro:0verSou1]
I need air I can't feel where Im at
But I know that I will survive
I will live on!
I will fly!

[Verse 1: Phantom Swami]
Its an baddie ocean
Im swimmin and sinning
Big wave like tsunami, I dont really have a limit
Tell ya slut keep her mouth shut,Iâ€™ll bust in yo girl Danimal
Deer prancing round town she can still get it doe
You a stale chip you a bad lay
Might fuck after some Chardonnay
Everclear vision so ray
She hit my line the  next day
Juggle these hoes like cirque du lei
Three in a night damn that shit cray, I brush a bitch teeth twice a day
Double textin ting I give her K
Why you fake flex Lil Tay, You ain't a queen dont know the way, Workin me she deserves a raise,For her pay Sunday her arms raised, To her king she gives the highest praise, Ain't a heffa but she slightly dazed, Face down ass up blanket she graze, Got a magic stick so she amazed--

[Verse 2]
Stay with dime pieces I ain't ever give up change
Gotta wildcat in my room so you know Im gonna tame
Put lil baby in a spiral and she claim she gotta sprain
Eat her cherry pie make that pussy whistle like a train, Yuh!
Grindin every hour ya boy got the Rocket Power
Trippin toadstools, shrooms I eat come with heat Im King Bowser!
Stack ain't got no bands so you know Im gonna splurge
Action over words, more or less Im all about my verbs!
Bitch get your funds up, Bitch give them buns up
Im divine apollo grindin eva since the sun up
Im a devil your worst nightmare on Freddy you gonna get cut
Like Kirby she inhale but ain't a leech but give that good succ!

Put two in her pinky then that bitch gon give me brain
Once a bunny go black ,she be walking with a cane
Tell it to my pee pee not my heart, this ain't no Taylor Dayne
Fuck her with my meatballs then Im gonna make that pussy rain
She Oliver(all over) for my bread but she ain't gon get a grain
You ain't nothing special girl, I pull bitches much as strains
Ya spray tanned Oompa loompa bitch you lookin like some tang
She drip water pussy fire bend her over just like Aang, Dang!Embed
