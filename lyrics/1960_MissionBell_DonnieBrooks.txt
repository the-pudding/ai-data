1 ContributorMission Bell LyricsMy love is higher than a mission bell (How deep)
Deeper than wishin' well (How strong)
Stronger than a magic spell

My love (Uh huh) for you
It's wider than the widest sea (How long)
Longer than a memory (How sweet)
Sweeter than a honey tree

My love (Uh huh), oh, oh, oh (Uh huh)
My love (Uh huh), mm, mm, mm (Uh huh) for you

Give me your heart of gold
Your heavenly magic touch
To cherish, have, and hold
I need your love so much

(Say that you love me)
(Say those pretty words and I will give my love to you)

My love is warmer than a day in spring (How bright)
Brighter than a diamond ring (How brave)
Braver than a mighty king

My love (Uh huh) for you
It's taller than the tallest tree (How soft)
Softer than a summer breeze
You might also likeAll I ask you, please
Give (Uh huh) your love (Uh huh)
Your love (Uh huh), sweet love (Uh huh) to me

(How high) higher than a mission bell
(How deep) deeper than a wishin' well
(How strong) stronger than a magic spell
(How wide)Embed
