1 ContributorAlone At Last LyricsAlone at last, you and I
Together locked in a sigh
The musics soft, lights are low;
The mood is one all lovers know
Oh, my darling at last we are one;
The trip to heavens begun;
I kiss your fingertips, your eyes, your lips
Oh what exciting moments we share when were
All alone at last
Oh, my darling, at last, you and I
Together locked in a sigh
The musics soft, lights are low;
The mood is one all lovers know
Oh, my darling at last we are one;
The trip to heavens begun;
I kiss your fingertips, your eyes, your lips
Oh what exciting moments we share when were
All alone at lastYou might also likeEmbed
