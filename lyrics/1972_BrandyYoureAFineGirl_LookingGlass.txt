34 ContributorsBrandy (Youâ€™re a Fine Girl) Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, "Brandy, fetch another round"
She serves them whiskey and wine

[Chorus]
The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

[Verse 2]
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

[Chorus]
The sailor said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes when he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise, she saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

[Verse 3]
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

[Chours]
She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is, it is
"Brandy, you're a fine girl" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is, it is3Embed
