1 ContributorI Know (You Donâ€™t Love Me No More) Lyrics[Chorus 1]
I know (I know)
You don't love me no more
No more (No more)
No, no more (No more)
And I don't want to be hurted anymore (No more)
Anymore (No more)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, I have loved so hard
Everything I did was no joy
Since I can't love you right, baby
I don't have to love you at all

[Chorus 2]
I know (I know)
You don't love me no more
No more (No more)
No, no more (No more)
And it has to be someone else lovin' you more (No more)
Lovin' you more (No more)

[Verse 2]
Ain't no use in me crying now
If not for you, I wouldn't be down
Since you don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use in you hanging 'round

(No more, no more)
(No more, no more)


[Chorus 2]
I know (I know)
You don't love me no more
No more (No more)
No, no more (No more)
And it has to be someone else lovin' you more (No more)
Lovin' you more (No more)

[Verse 2]
Ain't no use in me crying now
If not for you, I wouldn't be down
Since you don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use in you hanging 'round

[Outro]
I know (I know)
