Keys to the MG will be in his hands
Adjust to the drivin' and I'm on my way
It's all on the right side in Montego Bay
Sing out

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Come sing me loud
Come sing me Montego Bay
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

'N' Gillian'll meet me like a brother would
I think I remember but it's twice as good
Like how cool the rum is from his silver tray
I thirst to be thirsty in Montego Bay
Sing out

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Come sing me loud
Come sing me Montego Bay
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

I lay on a lilo 'til I'm lobster red
I still feel the motion here at home in bed
I tell you it's hard for me to stay away
You ain't been 'til you've been high Montego Bay
Sing out
You might also likeWhoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Come sing me loud
Come sing me Montego Bay
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

Dance in the streets

Just sing me loud
Come sing me Montego Bay
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa

Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
And I've got a beautiful feelin'
Everything's goin' my wayEmbed
