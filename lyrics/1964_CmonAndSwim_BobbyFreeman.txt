Bobby's gonna show you how to do the swim

Kinda like The Monkey, kinda like The Twist
Pretend you're in the water and you go like this

Now baby, Swim
Baby, do The Swim

Just like the Dog but not so low
Like the Hully Gully but not so slow

Now baby, Swim
Baby, do The Swim

Do what you wanna, do like you wish
C'mon baby now and swim like a fish

Now baby, Swim
Baby, come on in

Shake it up, baby, twist and shout
Now do The Swim, baby; now work it on out

Now baby, Swim
Baby, do The Swim
You might also likeDo what you wanna, it's alright
'Cause Bobby's gonna show you how to swim tonight
Now baby Swim

[Instrumental Break]

C'mon baby, I want you to swim
Oh yeah, I want you to do the dog paddle, baby
Now do the backstroke

Oh, yeah, kinda like The Monkey, kinda like The Twist
Pretend you're in the water and you go like this

Now baby, Swim
Baby, do The Swim

Just like the Dog but not so low
Like the Hully Gully but not so slow

Now baby, Swim
Baby, do The Swim

Do what you wanna, or do like you wish
C'mon baby now and swim like a fish

Now baby, Swim
Baby, come on in
Shake it up, baby, twist and shout
Do the swim, baby, now work it on out

Now baby, Swim
Baby, do The Swim

Do what you wanna, it's alright
'Cause Bobby's gonna do The Swim for you tonight
Now baby Swim

C'mon baby
Oh yeah, we're gonna swim tonight
I want you to do the dog paddle
I want you to bend your arms way out now
Now baby do the backstroke
Oh yeah, oh yeah, c'mon baby now
I want you to do The Swim, wooEmbed
