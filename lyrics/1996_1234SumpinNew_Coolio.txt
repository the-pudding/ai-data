39 Contributors1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin’ New) Lyrics[Intro]
This is some of the lingua franca of the funk business
And people come from miles around
With  an almost religious devotion to get on down

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down

[Verse 1]
What up everybody, so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention
Now I wants to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C-
Double O-L-I-O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know
One, two, three, it's like A, B, C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's that past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass
You might also like[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down

[Verse 2]
If you got beef, then nigga, eat a pork chop
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I break like anti-locks, panties drop
From hood to hood, block to block
Help, I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby, you can do it, take your time do it right
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night
My name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a jheri curl
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on, now what'cha gonna do, so
Grab your partner, do-si-do
Now if you don't know who it is, it's Coolio
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass
[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down

[Verse 3]
Push, push, in the bush
But don't step on my toes 'cause you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I bend a co'ner on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at 'em with a pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope he don't trip 'cause I don't want to have to gat 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homies crazy
The way you shake that ass, it always amaze me
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'Cause a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga in a Chevy hittin' switches
Then you gotta give the nigga his props
I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to get the party open
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass
[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down1Embed
