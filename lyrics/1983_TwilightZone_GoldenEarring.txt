32 ContributorsTwilight Zone Lyrics[Backmasked]
Sirens in my head
My whole life spins into a frenzy
Somewhere in a lonely hotel room
There's a guy starting to realize
That eternal fate has turned its back on him
It's two A.M

It's two A.M., the fear has gone
(It's two A.M., the fear has gone)
I'm sitting here waitin', the gun's still warm
(I'm sitting here waitin', the gun's still warm)
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances
Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?
You might also likeSoon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

I'm falling down the spiral destination unknown
Double crossed messenger all alone
Can't get no connection, can't get through
Where are you?

Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

And he says, "Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?"

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone, a ha
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone, a ha
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone, a ha
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone, a ha
When the bullet hits the bone7Embed
