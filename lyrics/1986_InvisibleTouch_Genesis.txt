Well I've been waiting
Waiting here so long
But thinking nothing
Nothing could go wrong, ooh now I know

[Pre-Chorus]
She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I'm falling
Falling for her

[Chorus]
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

[Verse 2]
Well I don't really know her
I only know her name
But when she crawls under your skin
You're never quite the same, and now I know

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got something you just can't trust
It's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling
Falling for her
You might also like[Chorus]
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

[Verse 3]
Well, she don't like losing
To her, it's still a game
And though she will mess up your life
You'll want her just the same, and now I know

[Pre-Chorus]
She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I've fallen
Fallen for her
[Chorus]
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

[Outro]
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She seems to have an invisible touch, oh
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She seems to have an invisible touch, oh
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She seems to have an invisible touch, oh
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She seems to have an invisible touch, oh3Embed
