4 ContributorsJohnny Get Angry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Johnny I said we were through
Just to see what you would do
You stood there, and hung your head
Made me wish that I were dead

[Chorus]
Oh, Johnny get angry
Johnny get mad
Give me the biggest lecture that I ever had
I want a brave man
I want a cave man
Johnny show me that you care, really care for me

[Verse 2]
Every time you dance with me
You let Freddy cut in constantly
When he does, you never speak
Must you always be so meek?

[Chorus]
Oh, Johnny get angry
Johnny get mad
Give me the biggest lecture that I ever had
I want a brave man
I want a cave man
Johnny show me that you care, really care for me
You might also like[Verse 3]
Every girl wants someone who
She can always look up to
You know I love you, of course
Let me know that you're the boss

[Chorus]
Oh Johnny get angry
Johnny get mad
Give me the biggest lecture that I ever had
I want a brave man
I want a cave man
Johnny show me that you care, really care for me

[Outro]
Johnny, care for me
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...Embed
