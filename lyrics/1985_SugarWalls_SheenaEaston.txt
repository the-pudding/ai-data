My sugar walls
My sugar walls

[Verse 1]
Where I come from, there's a place called Heaven
That's the place where all the good children go
The houses are of silver, the streets are gold
But there's more where you come from, my sugar walls

[Refrain]
My sugar walls (Ooh)
My sugar walls

[Verse 2]
Blood races to your private spots
Lets me know there's a fire
You can't fight passion when passion is hot
Temperatures rise inside my sugar walls

[Chorus]
Let me take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never wanna fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls

[Verse 3]
I feel so alive when I'm with you
Come and feel my presence
It's raining tonight
Heaven on Earth inside my sugar walls

[Chorus]
Let me take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never wanna fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls

[Interlude]
I can tell you want me (My sugar walls)
It's impossible to hide
Your body's on fire, admit it
Come inside (My sugar walls)

[Outro]
Ahh (My sugar walls), ooh
Come inside (My sugar walls), my sugar walls
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (My sugar walls)
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls
My sugar walls
My sugar wallsEmbed
