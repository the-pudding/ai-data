[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas be rollin', schemin' on you and your homies
The very first day of summer, all chromed out in a Hummer, babe
Hit the park and parlay, hope that you walk this way
Do you and your girls wanna ride, play all day, puff on the lye?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, say what? Say what? Say what? (You know that I like it, baby)
Ooh, girl, you know what's up (And you know what I need)

So tell me, what's up? (So tell me, what's up, baby?)

Peep her thighs and I'm zonin' right around two in the mornin'
Lookin' fly with the sun dress on, I think I feel a bone comin' on
Girl, you got me wide open, waitin' all day and I'm hopin'
So, baby, don't front, backseat Jeep, you know what I want
