5 ContributorsCan I Change My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ah, she didn't bat an eye
As I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would start to cry
Or sit around my room and grieve
But y'all, the girl
She fooled me this time
She acted like I was the last thing on her mind
I would like to start all over again

[Chorus]
Baby, can I change my mind?
I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind

[Verse 2]
As I took those steps
Toward that open door
Knowing all the time
Oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go
But she didn't give me no sign
Nothin' that would make me change my mind
I would like to start all over again

[Chorus]
Baby, can I change my mind?
Please, please, please, baby
I just wanna change my mind

Oh, I played my games
Many times before
But, peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door
But, ooh, the wind is howl tonight
I keep lookin' back, but my baby's not in sight
I would like to start all over again

[Chorus]
Baby, can I change my mind?
Please, please, please, baby
Baby, let me change my mind

[Outro]
I'm so sorryEmbed
