30 ContributorsLove in an Elevator Lyrics[Intro: Catherine Epps & Steven Tyler]
2nd floor, hardware, children's wear, lady's lingerie
Oh, good morning Mr. Tyler, going down?
Hehehehehe, ooh
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Steven Tyler]
Workin' like a dog for the boss man (Whoa)
Workin' for the company (Whoa, yeah)
Bettin' on the dice I'm tossin' (Whoa)
I'm gonna have a fantasy (Whoa, yeah)
But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines

[Chorus: Steven Tyler]
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground

[Verse 2: Steven Tyler]
Jackie's in the elevator (Whoa)
Lingerie second floor (Whoa, yeah)
She said, "Can I see you later" (Whoa)
"And love you just a little more?" (Whoa, yeah)
I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said, "I'll show you how to fax in the mail room, honey
And have you home by five"

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down

[Verse 3: Steven Tyler]
Gonna be a penthouse pauper (Whoa)
Gonna be a millionaire (Whoa, yeah)
I'm gonna be a real fast talker (Whoa)
And have me a love affair (Whoa, yeah)
Gotta get my timing right (Whoa)
It's a test that I got to pass (Whoa, yeah)
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway, honey (Whoa)
Kiss your sassafras
[Chorus: Steven Tyler]
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
