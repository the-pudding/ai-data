5 ContributorsIf I Were a Carpenter Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?

[Verse 2]
If a tinker were my trade
Would you still find me
Carrin' the pots I made
Followin' behind me?

[Bridge]
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love for sorrow
I'm given you my onliness
Come give your tomorrow

[Verse 3]
If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me?
Answer me, babe, "Yes, I would
I'll put you above me"

[Verse 4]
If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color box
Your soft shoe shinin'?
You might also like[Verse 1]
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?

[Outro]
Would you marry anyway?
Would you have my baby?Embed
