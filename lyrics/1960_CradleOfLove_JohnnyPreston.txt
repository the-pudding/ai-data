3 ContributorsCradle of Love LyricsWell rock-a-bye baby in the tree top
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
So rock-a-bye baby in the tree top
When the wind blows

Well Jack be nimble Jack be quick
Jack jumped over the candle stick
He jumped so high up above
He landed in the cradle of love

Well rock-a-bye baby in the tree top
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
So rock-a-bye baby in the tree top
When the wind blows

Hi diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle
The cow jumped over the moon
On,on her way down she met her turtle dove
Said let's go rockin' in the cradle of love

Well rock-a-bye baby in the tree top
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
So rock-a-bye baby in the tree top
When the wind blows

Jack and Jill went up the hill
To get the pail of water
Jack fell for Jill and gave her a shove
And landed in the cradle of love

When the wind blows the cradle will rock
So rock-a-bye baby in the tree top
When the wind blowsEmbed
