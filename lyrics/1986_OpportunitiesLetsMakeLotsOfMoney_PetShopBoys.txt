I've got the brains, you've got the looks
Let's make lots of money
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains
Let's make lots of...

[Verse 1]
I've had enough of scheming
And messing around with jerks
My car is parked outside
I'm afraid it doesn't work
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who gets things fixed
Ask yourself this question:
Do you want to be rich?

[Chorus]
I've got the brains, you've got the looks
Let's make lots of money
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains
Let's make lots of money

[Verse 2]
You can tell I'm educated
I studied at the Sorbonne
Doctored in mathematics
I could have been a don
I can program a computer
Choose the perfect time
If you've got the inclination
I have got the crime

Oh, there's a lot of opportunities
If you know when to take them
You know, there's a lot of opportunities
If there aren't you can make them
Make or break them

[Chorus]
I've got the brains, you've got the looks
Let's make lots of money
Let's make lots of

[Interlude]
Money

[Verse 3]
You can see I'm single-minded
I know what I could be
How'd you feel about it?
Come and take a walk with me
I'm looking for a partner
Regardless of expense
Think about it seriously
You know it makes sense

[Chorus]
Let's make
(Got the brains, got the looks)
Let's make lots of money
(Money)
(Let's make)
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains
(Ooh)
Let's make lots of money
(Money)
[Chorus]
I've got the brains, you've got the looks
(Got the brains, got the looks)
Let's make lots of money
(Ooh money)
