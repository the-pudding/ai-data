You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end, I've had my doubts
Denyin' every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
And you say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me "baby"
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
And you say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me "baby"
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lyin' and tearin' us up

[Chorus]
And you say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me "baby"
I know I'm not the only one
And you say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me "baby"
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one436Embed
