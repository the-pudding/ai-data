10 ContributorsWhere The Boys Are Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where the boys are
Someone waits for me
A smilin' face, a warm embrace
Two arms to hold me tenderly

[Verse 2]
Where the boys are
My true love will be
He's walking down some street in town
And I know he's lookin' there for me

[Bridge]
In the crowd of a million people
I'll find my valentine
And then I'll climb to the highest steeple
And tell the world he's mine

[Chorus]
'Til he holds me, I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Where the boys are, someone waits for me
'Til he holds me, I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Where the boys are, someone waits for meYou might also like1Embed
