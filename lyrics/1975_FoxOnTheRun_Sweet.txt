28 ContributorsFox on the Run Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before
Okay, you think you got a pretty face
But the rest of you is out of place
You looked alright before

[Chorus]
Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a-running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Foxy is on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away

[Verse 2]
You, you talk about just every band
But the names you drop are second-hand (second-hand)
I've heard it all before
I don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before

[Chorus]
Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a-running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Fox is on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away
You might also like[Chorus 2]
F-foxy
Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a-running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Fox is on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run
And hide away
(Fox on the run)
(Fox on the run)
(Fox on the run)
