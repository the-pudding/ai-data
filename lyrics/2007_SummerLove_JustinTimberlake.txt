2 ContributorsSummer Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ridin' in the drop top with the top down
Saw you switchin' lanes, girl
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right
Come here, let me get your name, girl
Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like
Let me pick your brain, girl
And tell me how they got that pretty little face
On that pretty little frame, girl
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out
Bet you we could have some fun, girl
'Cause we can do it fast, fast, slow
Whichever way you wanna run, girl
But let mе buy you drinks, better yet, rings
Do it how you want it donе, girl
And who would've thought that you could be the one, 'cause I

[Chorus]
I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

[Verse 2]
Come on and lemme show you 'round, let me take you out
Bet you we could have some fun, girl
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down
Any way you want it done, girl
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone
Rappin' 'til we see the sun, girl
Do what I gotta do
Just gotta show you that I'm the one, girl
Well, I'ma freak you right each and every night
I know how to do it insane, girl
'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop
Make you wanna say my name, girl
Come on, baby, please, 'cause I'm on my knees
Can't get you off my brain, girl
But who would've thought that you could be the one, 'cause I

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

[Bridge]
The summer's over for the both of us (Summer's over)
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love (Don't give up)
You're the one that I've been thinking of (You're the one)
And I knew the day I met you, you'd be the one, oh!

[Chorus]
I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see

'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
