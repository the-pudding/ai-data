Okay (Believe me), wait a minute
Gimme– Just gimme… gimme…
(Anybody fucks up… Right)
Gimme a break for a second
Two, three (four)… One, two, three…
One, ah-two… ah-one, two, three

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much, but something's wrong
There's something here that doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine

[Verse 2]
Seeing you
Or seeing anything as much as I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through

[Bridge]
It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me

Think of me
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should

[Bridge]
It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me

[Verse 3]
Think of me
You, you know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should

[Outro]
Think of me, think of me, think of me
Think of me, think of me, think of me
Think of me, think of me, think of me
Think of me, think of me, think of me
Think of me, think of me, think of me
Think of me, think of me, think of me
Think of me, think of me, think of me6Embed
