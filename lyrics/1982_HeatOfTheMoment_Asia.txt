I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you, and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

[Verse 2]
Do you remember when we used to dance?
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

[Chorus]
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

[Verse 3]
And now you find yourself in Eighty Two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

[Chorus]
'Cause it's the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes
You might also like[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone?
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambitions you remember well

[Chorus]
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

[Outro]
It was the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment showed in your eyes

Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the momentâ€¦13Embed
