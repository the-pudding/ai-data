47 ContributorsWant To Want Me Lyrics[Intro]
Derulo

[Verse 1]
It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys? 'Cause I gotta leave, yeah
In the back of the cab (ooh)
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast (Ooh)
I got your body on my mind, I want it bad (Ooh)
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

[Chorus]
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, no, I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just to get up next to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Aw yeah
