Stay with me, and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave 'cause I believe

Hear me calling out your name—I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way

Your heart has called me closer to you
I will be all that you need
Just trust in what we're feeling
Never leave, 'cause, baby, I believe

Hear me calling out your name—I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way

There's no stronger love in this world—oh, baby, no
You're my man, I'm your girl—I'll never go
Wait and see, can't be wrong
