I love, I love, I love my calendar girl
Yeah, sweet calendar girl
I love, I love, I love my calendar girl
Each and every day of the year

[Verse 1]
(January)
You start the year all fine
(February)
You're my little Valentine
(March)
I'm gonna march you down the aisle
(April)
You're the Easter bunny
When you smile

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
My heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl
Every day (Every day)
Every day (Every day)
Of the year (Every day of the year)

[Verse 2]
(May)
Maybe if I ask your dad and mom
(June)
They'd let me take you to the junior prom
(July)
Like a firecracker, I'm aglow
(August)
When you're on the beach you steal the show
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah (Ahh)
My heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl
Every day (Every day)
Every day (Every day)
Of the year (Every day of the year)

Whoo

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah (Ahh)
My heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl
Every day (Every day)
Every day (Every day)
Of the year (Every day of the year)

[Verse 3]
(September)
I light the candles at your sweet sixteen
(October)
Romeo and Juliet on Halloween
(November)
I'll give thanks that you belong to me
(December)
You're the present 'neath my Christmas tree
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah (Ahh)
My heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl
Every day (Every day)
Every day (Every day)
Of the year (Every day of the year)
