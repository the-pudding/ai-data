[Chorus]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathin' fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothin' I've ever
Seen before or will again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turnin'
As long as the stars are burnin'
As long as your dreams are comin' true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feelin'
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turnin'
As long as the fires are burnin'
As long as your prayers are comin' true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do that
[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreamin' of
But I just won't do that

[Chorus]
But I'll never stop dreamin' of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Bridge: Lorraine Crosby & Meat Loaf]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
Will you hold me sacred?
Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life?
I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh no, now, I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me somethin' I can take home?
Now, I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now, I can do that
Oh no, now, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwin' around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Outro]
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that9Embed
