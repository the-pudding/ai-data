Yeah, boy. Another ABC card
Comin' from the playground
Take it straight back to the bricks
Yo Chris, tell 'em where it is

Chris:
Chillin, cooler than a squeak, kickin' dirt on my sneakers
Suckers on the corner lookin down at their beepers
They couldn't get a job or a nice home
So they wanna stay and wait for the pay-phone
Take JoJo he's the youngest
Girls jock him cuz he's reverse dressed
?? strollin through the neighborhood
Sweatin' their brother tryin' to see why he's doin' good
(sounds of sirens)
Rollin' through the park tryin' to make another hit
Little do they know that soldier's legit
I'm not sayin this to put nobody down
This is what I see at the playground, ya know!

GA:
Awww yeah! Another ABC smash
But don't it make ya mad?
Uh, come on come on everybody
And guess who's up next, kick it!

L-I-L D-A-V-E, 4 feet, shorty of the crew
Just let me get on the mic and show you what I can do
Cold rockin' the microphone at home
?? playin' under the phone
Large is how I'm livin', homes

Group:
Kick it D kick it D kick it
Punch it D punch it D punch it
Swing it D swing it D swing it

Dave:
I swing my beats at the playground, ya know!

GA:
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
I don't wanna see nobody sittin' in their chair
Do dat! Do dat! Yo Ro you up next!

Ro:
Well I'm RoRo comin in third
Now its about that time that I get heard (hey!)
And none of my rhymes will never ever be served
Word to her play tricks on your nerves
Everywhere I swerve is real superb
And I'll be right back with part two of this funky rhyme, G
Haha, yeah boy!
Yo Red I don't wanna flow no more, man
Y'all go ahead, I'm just gonna sit back and listen to this ghetto swing
Cuz this is what I do at the playground, ya know what I'm sayin'?
GA:
Awww yeah
ABC's gonna sing! Added to this missile - fusion hip hop with a little ghetto swing
Yo Red, kick the ballistics, G

Red:
Its the R to the E to the D and what you get is what you seein'
Straight up east boy, word to miss
Kickin' and flippin' the rhymes for the kids man (for the kids)
Chillin' in the park, nice and smooth
?? Mark tried to bust my groove
?? words to the beat
This is where I met Iesha
Had a big fanny, not like Annie
Gave up the 24 letter and some candy, haha
(Where'd you meet her?)
At the playground, ya know!

GA:
Ok, I guess you know by now
Mismatched
Pants inside out
A fresh Starter cap
A ?? with a name on the front
Smooth
Yo Mark, take it home
Mark:
It's the Mizzark, chillin' in the pizzark
I gotta break cuz my mother said be home by dizzark
But before I go, I'm gonna flow for you one time see
So listen to the rhyme, G
The East Coast Family, Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
Now flip the track, D
My momma is mad and my brother is Red
It's Mario Brothers when it's time for bed
Last but not least, I wanna say peace and we be outta here
From the playground, ya know!

GA:
I wanna say what's up to my homies
