I walk along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotise me through
Hypnotise me through

[Chorus]
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

[Verse 2]
A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

[Chorus]
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

[Verse 3]
Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Appearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

[Outro]
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I couldn't get away21Embed
