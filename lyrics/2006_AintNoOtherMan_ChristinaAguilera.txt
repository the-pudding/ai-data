28 ContributorsAinâ€™t No Other Man Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, yeah
(Do your thang, honey)

[Verse 1]
I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Somethin' 'bout you caught my eye
Somethin' moved me deep inside, yeah
I don't know what you did, boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since

[Pre-Chorus]
I told my mother, my brother
My sister and my friends
Told the others (Others), my lovers (Lovers)
Both past and present tense (Alright)
That every time I see you, everything starts making sense
(Do your thang, honey)

[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (What you do)
You're the kind of guy, a girl finds in a blue moon (Hey)
You got soul (Hey), you got class (Ooh), you got style, you're badass (Oh yeah)
Ain't no other man, it's true (Alright)
Ain't no other man but you

What was cloudy now is clear, yeah, yeah
You're the light that I need here, yeah
You got what I want boy, and I want it
So keep on giving it up

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell your mother (Mother), your brother (Brother)
Your sister and your friends (Your sister and your friends)
Tell the others (Others), your lovers (Lovers)
Better not be present tense (Uh-huh)
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no one else's
Whoa whoa, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (To you, babe)
Ain't no other man (Ain't no other man, no) on the planet does what you do (Do)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds (A girl finds) in a blue moon (Hey)
You got soul (Soul), you got class (Class)
You got style (Uh), you're badass (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no other man it's true

Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other, other
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover (Ooh-woo)
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you, oh
You are there when I'm a mess
You talked me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test
[Chorus]
Ain't no other man (Woo) can stand (Yeah) up next to you (Next to you, no, hey, yeah, alright)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (Ooh, eh)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon (You're the kind of guy a girl will find)
You got soul (Yeah), you got class (Yeah)
You got style (Oh), you're badass (Oh yeah)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
