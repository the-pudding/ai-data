Slick got more game than a little bit
Baby girl 5'5", brown eyes with the thick lips
Thick thighs with the slim hips
Sugar honey ice tea, baby girl so sweet, and a bag of chips
I like to catch her when she comin' home
Lights out, girl, you know it's on
Lookin' good like a sundae cone
You got me hopin', no sugarcoatin'
Love John is strokin', no jokin'
Girl, I'm focused, the bedroom smokin'
Get some air up in this room, girl (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
If lovin' you is wrong, then I don't wanna be right
So I'ma take my time and do it right
'Cause we got all night
'Cause we got all night, baby girl, justâ€”
