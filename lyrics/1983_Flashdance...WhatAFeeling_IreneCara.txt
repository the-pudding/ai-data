First, when there's nothing, but a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind
All alone, I have cried, silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel, made of stone

[Verse 1]
Well, I hear the music, close my eyes, feel the rhythm
Wrap around, take a hold of my heart

[Chorus]
What a feelin', being's believin'
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion, and make it happen
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life

[Verse 2]
Now I hear the music, close my eyes, I am rhythm
In a flash, it takes hold of my heart

[Chorus]
What a feelin', being's believin'
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion, and make it happen
Pictures come alive, now I'm dancing through my life

[Chorus / Outro]
What a feelin', being's believin' (I am music now, I am rhythm now)
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life

What a feelin', what a feelin'
(I can really have it all, pictures come alive when I call)
I can have it all, have it all
(I can really have it all, pictures come alive when I call)

(Call, call, call, oh, what a feelin')
I can have it all
Being's believin', take your passion (Being's believin', oh)
Make it happen, what a feelin' (Make it happen, what a feelin')6Embed
