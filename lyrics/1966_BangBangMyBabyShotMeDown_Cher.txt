29 ContributorsBang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus]
Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play?"

[Chorus]
"Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you'd hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down"

[Bridge]
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Now he's gone, I don't know why
And till this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

[Chorus]
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down2Embed
