You're the one that I'm dreamin' of
Baby, you're the one that I love

[Verse 2]
Keep me in your heart, never let us part
Ooh, never leave me, please don't deceive me
I want you only, you must believe me

Baby, you're the one that I really miss (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the one that I'm dreamin' of
Baby, you're the one that I love
