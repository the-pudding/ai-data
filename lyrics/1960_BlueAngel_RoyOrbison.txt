No, don't cry (Bum-be-doo-be-dum, yep-yep)
Oh, blue angel, have no fear, I'll (Bum-be-doo-be-dum)
Brush away each lonely teardrop (Bum-be-doo-be-dum, yep-yep)

[Bridge]
Well, love's precious flame, it just burned in vain
But you're not to blame
You thought love was a game and it's-a, oh, such a shame
But don't you cry, don't sigh, I'll tell you why
I'll never say goodbye, blue angel
(Sha-la-la, dooby-wah)
(Bum-bum-bum, yep-yep)
(Bum, wah-wah-wah-wah)
(Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum)

We'll have love so fine
Magic moments divine
If you'll just say you're mine
I'll love you 'til the end of time
Don't you worry your pretty head
I'll never let you down
I'll always be around, blue angel
(Sha-la-la, dooby-wah)
(Bum-bum-bum, yep-yep, bum)
