Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

[Verse 1]
For five long years
I thought you were my man
But I found out, love
I'm just a link in your chain, oh
You got me where you want me
I ain't nothing but your fool
You treated me mean, oh
You treated me cruel

[Chorus]
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

[Verse 2]
Every chain
Has got a weak link
I might be weak, yeah
But I'll give you strength, oh, hey
You told me to leave you alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
My father said come on home (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
My doctor said take it easy (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, but your loving is much too strong (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm added to your chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Your chain of fools, oh

[Verse 3]
One of these mornings
The chain is gonna break
But up until the day
I'm gonna take all I can take, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools, oh

[Outro]
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain, oh
Chain, chain, chain
Your chain of fools, oh yeah
Chain, chain, chain3Embed
