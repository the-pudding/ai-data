Baby, baby
Let's get together
Honey, honey, me and you
And do the things
Ah, do the things
That we like to do

[Chorus]
Oh, do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight
Do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby
I'll meet you
Same place, same time
Where we can all get together
And ease up our mind

[Chorus]
Oh, do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight, (Whoo) get down tonight (Hey)
Do a little dance
Make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight (Baby)
