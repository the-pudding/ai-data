43 ContributorsManic Monday Lyrics[Verse 1]
Six o'clock already, I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino by a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late, 'cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days when you wish your bed was already made

[Chorus]
It's just another manic Monday (Ooh-oh)
Wish it were Sunday (Ooh-oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ooh-oh)
My I-don't-have-to-run day (Ooh)
It's just another manic Monday

[Verse 2]
Have to catch an early train, got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane, I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train, but the boss is already there

[Chorus]
It's just another manic Monday (Ooh-oh)
Wish it were Sunday (Ooh-oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ooh-oh)
My I-don't-have-to-run day (Ooh)
It's just another manic Monday

Of all of my nights, why did my lover have to pick
Last night to get down? (Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
"C'mon, honey, let's go make some noise" (I can't resist)
Time, it goes so fast (When you're having fun)

[Chorus]
It's just another manic Monday (Ooh-oh)
Wish it were Sunday (Ooh-oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ooh-oh)
My I-don't-have-to-run day (Ooh)
It's just another manic Monday (Ooh-oh)
Wish it were Sunday (Ooh-oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ooh-oh)
It's just another manic Monday4Embed
