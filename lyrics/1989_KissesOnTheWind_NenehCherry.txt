8 ContributorsKisses on the Wind Lyrics[Sarah Erde:]
Pero chica, mi amiga, ¿que dice?
Esto es yo, esto es yo y como hablo
Y hablo así y hablo así contigo

Do, do-do-do, do-do, do, do

Nah, man
(What we gonna do right here is go back!)
(Yeah!)
Nah, man, you know
(Way back, back into time!)

Ay, pero man
(Take me back)
No soy tu amiga, tú sabes
Yo soy tu amiga
(I don't speak Swahili)
¿Qué? ¿Pero qué dices chica?
Ay, me voy

Down this wild street walks
Walks a child with no trace
Of ever being as young as her sister is
A local neighborhood crush
The boys would hide out and watch
Her hanging washing on the line all the time
You might also like[Chorus:]
More like a woman, she talks like one
She was the first girl
She was the first girl to turn the boys on

Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone
She blows them kisses on the wind

Te compraste una bomba pero no me importa

At the corner shop, halfway down the block
All the radios pumping to the way she walks
Past the flyboys art, where her name's engraved
Sweet liberty is what it says

More like a woman, she dress like one
She was the first girl
She was the first girl, to turn the boys on

Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone
She blows them kisses on the wind
Te compraste una bomba

Pero no me importa, qué te digo, hombre, mi amigo
(Blow me another kiss, baby!)
Ah it doesn't matter, you know what I'm saying
Ah no, forget it because I'm going there man you know?
You can follow me
But you know what I'm saying don't make me say it
Ah, no sé (okay, me voy)

The price of puberty's got a way of showing
It doesn't come in easy stages
Her mother's face in the pot, won't ever leave it
She needs a bell to ring the changes

More like a woman she walks like one
She was the first girl
She was the first girl, to turn the boys on

Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone
She blows them kisses on the wind

Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone
She blows them kisses on the wind
Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone
She blows them kisses on the wind

Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone
She blows them kisses on the windEmbed
