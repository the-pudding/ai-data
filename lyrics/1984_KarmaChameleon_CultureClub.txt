Desert loving in your eyes all the way
If I listen to your lies, would you say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go, you come and go

[Chorus]
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green

[Verse 2]
Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet, I heard you say

[Pre-Chorus]
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
You string along, you string along
You might also like[Chorus]
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green

[Bridge]
Every day is like survival (Survival)
You're my lover, not my rival
Every day is like survival (Survival)
You're my lover, not my rival

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go, you come and go

[Chorus]
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
Red gold and green, red gold and green
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green22Embed
