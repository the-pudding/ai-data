1 ContributorOldies Medley LyricsWell, she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting goes cruising
Just as fast as she can now

And she'll have fun, fun, fun
Till her daddy takes the T-bird away
Fun, fun, fun
Till her daddy takes the T-bird away

Well, you knew all along that your dad
Was getting wise to you now
(Shouldn’t have lied now, shouldn’t have lied)
And since he took your set of keys you've been
Thinking that your fun is all through now
(Shouldn’t have lied now, you shouldn’t have lied)
But you can come along with me 'causе we
Got a lot of things to do now

And we'll have fun, fun, fun
Now that Daddy took thе T-bird away
Fun, fun, fun
Now that Daddy took the T-bird away
You might also likeFun, fun
Now that Daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun
Now that Daddy took the T-bird away

Hey, [?], it's 53 degrees and thirteen minutes past the big boss hour, and where were you when this song was number one?

Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
Cause you don't love me anymore

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand
No, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

Ah, what memories, what memories, from nineteen-hundred-and-sixty-three! Later that same year this golden goodie blast from the past was introduced by The Crystals!

I met him on a Monday and my heart stood still
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Somebody told me that his name was Bill
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yeah, my heart stood still
Yeah, his name was Bill
And when he walked me home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yeah, he looked so fine
Yeah, I'll make him mine
And when he walked me home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yeah da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Yeah da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

What a sound, but right now, we're gonna give you another clue in our "Guess The Golden Goodies Group" contest!
So now, let's listen closely to the mystery voices in clue number ten!
[Unintelligible voices]
Great, I'll take call number eight, as the revving of engines and screeching of tires brings us back to "Dead Man's Curve"!

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were bugging each other while we sat out the light
We both popped our clutch when the light turned green
You should have heard the whine from my screaming machine

I flew past La Bream down to Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six taillights
He passed me at Doheny and I started to swerve
But I pulled it out and there we were, at Deadman's curve

Deadman's Curve is no place to play
Deadman's Curve

Well, the last thing I remember, Doc., I started to swerve
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
I found out for myself that everyone was right:

Won't come back from Deadman's Curve

Deadman's Curve is no place to play
Deadman's Curve, you best keep away
Deadman's Curve, I can hear them say
You won't come back from Deadman's Curve

Johnny Angel, Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel, Johnny Angel
You're an angel to me

Johnny Angel, how I love him
How I tingle when he passes by
Every time he says hello
My heart begins to fly

Johnny Angel, how I want him
He's got something that I can't resist
But he doesn't even know that I exist

I'm in heaven
I get carried away
I dream of him and me
And how it's going to be
Other fellows
Call me up for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate

On Johnny Angel 'cause I love him
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see
How lovely heaven will be

And together we will see
How lovely heaven will be

They say that you're a run-around lover
Though you say it isn't so
But if you put me down for another
I'll know, believe me, I'll know

'Cause the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes can't help but see
If you aren't true to me
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes

One of these days you're going to be sorry
'Cause your game I'm going to play
And you'll find out without really trying
Each time that my kisses stray

That the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes will see me through
And no matter what I do
I could never disguise all those little white lies
'Cause the night has a thousand eyes
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes

That was "The Night Has A Thousand Eyes", one of Bobby Vee's biggest hits! Alright, right now I've got Mark Rudolph of Hollywood, California on the line. Mark, are you there?
Yeah...
Mark Rudolph, for 1,000 dollars, can you give me the identity of our Golden Mystery Group?
...Mark, are you there?
Yeah, The Four Seasons
Mark Rudolph, would you repeat your answer, please?
The Four Seasons?
Mark Rudolph... you are WRONG! Boy!

Our day will come
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring

No one can tell me
That I'm too young to know (young to know)
I love you so (love you so)
And you love me

Our day will come
If we just wait a while
No tears for us
Think love and wear a smile

Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay
In love this way
Our day will come

Our day will come

Our day will come

Fantastic, and you know we hope you'll always be digging those totally terrific top-ten tunes, as the hits just keep on coming!

One fine day, you'll look at me
And you'll know our love was meant to be
One fine day, you're going to want me for your girl
Oh yeah

Your arms I long for will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me right by your side
One fine day, you're going to want me for your girl

One fine day, you're going to want me for your girl, oh
One fine day, oh yeah
One fine day, oh yeah
One fine day, oh yeah
One fine day, oh yeah
One fine day, oh yeahEmbed
