1 ContributorSound Sleep LyricsI put away your things
In a box hid under
A lock & key
It’s the only way for me
To try and get back on my feet
Take a step back, so I can breathe

And I have to realize
That things are changing

I took a picture of the past
And turned it into shattered glass
And walked away and didn’t
Care to pick up all the pieces
Abandon all these memories
And maybe I can get some sleep

To think that I
Thought that for the rest of my life
We would always be by each other’s side
Change is the only constant
But I’m having trouble
Dealing with my own

But we agree
That this is for the best
But I’m finding it so hard
And I’ve been such a mess
But I know deep inside
Things will get better in time
I won’t need you by my side
You might also likeI took a picture of the past
And turned it into shattered glass
And walked away and didn’t
Care to pick up all the pieces
Abandon all these memories
And maybe I can get some sleep

I hope you’re thinking of meEmbed
