As I stand here contemplating
On the right thing to decide
Will I take the wrong direction all my life?
Where will I go?
What lies ahead of me?

[Verse 2: Tamika]
I have strong determination
And I'm not afraid of change
I have yet to find that someone
Who would care to satisfy me
To stay right by me, oh

[Chorus: Xscape, (Tamika)]
Who can I run to (Who can I run to?)
To share this empty space? (Tell me)
Who can I run to
When I need love? (Oh, oh)
Who can I run to (Who can I run to?)
To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to
When I need love? (Sweet love)

[Verse 3: Tamika]
In my mind, it's so confusing
Who would be that special one?
Every day, I'm trying to find you on the run
I've got to know, is there a place for me?

I know love has many meanings
And a message very clear
All it takes is time and patience
To bring it near
But who got me?

[Chorus: Xscape, (LaTocha)]
Who can I run to (Who can I run to?)
To share this empty space? (This empty space)
Who can I run to
When I need love? (Love)
Who can I run to (Who can I run to?)
To fill this empty space with laughter? (Mmm)
Who can I run to (When I need love)
When I need love? (Love, yeah)

[Outro: LaTocha, (Xscape)]
Ooh, who can I run to?
I need love, yeah
(Who can, who can I run to?) Ooh
(Oh, when I need love) I need it, I need it
(Who can, who can I run to?) Who can I run to, oh yeah?
(When I need love) I need love, and you need love
(Who can, who can I run to?) Oh yeah, who can I run to?
(Oh, when I need love) I need love
(Who can, who can I run to?) Yeah
(When I need love)9Embed
