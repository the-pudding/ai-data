2 ContributorsHalloween Playlist Part II: A to Z LyricsWhile working on college radio, we had a discussion about stations that play endless Christmas music all through December. That would never fly at the college, but taking the entire day of Halloween and playing themed music?

The idea grew, and suddenly I had pulled song after song for a playlist. It was about an eight hour loop, with about an extra hour to make sure Thriller play enough times to satisfy everyone. I did always choose the most well-known version of a song. Some times, I chose an interesting cover version.

My personal project was to hunt down as many versions as possible of the Donovan song Season of the Witch. That's the first part of my list.

Here, then, is the A to Z portion of my Halloween Playlist, sans the Donovan song:
