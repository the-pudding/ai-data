27 ContributorsShawty Lyrics[Intro: Plies & T-Pain]
Ay, what's happenin', homie?
This your lil' one Plies, man (Shawty, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ay, Pain, I want you to tell 'em bout your shawty, homie
And I'ma tell 'em 'bout mine, dawg

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Even though I'm not your man, you're not my girl, I'ma call you my shawty
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad, I beat his ass for my shawty
And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do, 'cause you my shawty (Woah-oh)
Baby girl, you know I be home, keep me on the ringtone, shawty, yeah
Sing it to me girl

[Verse 1: Plies]
Soon as I seen her, shit, told her I'd pay for it
Lil' mama the baddest thing 'round here, she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her, "This supposed to be yours" (Ha-ha)
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city, baby, you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga and she went for it
First time I caught her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right (Game right)
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her, "I 'on't usually do this, I 'on't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat ya, baby, I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life" (Ha!)
I got her trained, now she suck me with ice
I call her, "My Lil' Bust-It-Baby", 'cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whenever I wanna get off, she know how to get me right

[Verse 2: Plies]
I love her to show off, 'cause all the dope boys want her
Know why they wanna beat bae, look all that ass on her
Look at how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bowlegged and bend the corner
She proud to be fuckin' me, 'cause I'm stuntin' on 'em
It feel good to be fuckin' a real nigga, don't it?
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin' her off, 'cause she ain't with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin' 'cause I done beat her Honda
Bae snatchin', not now, I'm tellin' ya, I promise (Bae snatchin', I promise)
I exposed her to real, and now she hate lame
'Member she used to run from me, now she like pain
She call me sometimes just to ask me is it a thang
Ever since I ran up in shawty, she ain't been the same (Ain't been the same)
[Chorus: T-Pain]
Even though I'm not your man, you're not my girl, I'ma call you my shawty
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad, I beat his ass for my shawty
And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do, 'cause you my shawty (Woah-oh)
Baby girl, you know I be home, keep me on the ringtone, shawty, yeah
Sing it to me girl

[Post-Chorus: T-Pain]
Oh-oh (Whoa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Whoa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Wh-oa-wh-oa, wh-oa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Whoa)
Shawty, yeah
Oh-oh (Whoa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Whoa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Wh-oa-wh-oa, wh-oa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Whoa)
