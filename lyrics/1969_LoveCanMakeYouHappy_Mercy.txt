4 ContributorsLove (Can Make You Happy) LyricsWake up in the morning with the sunshine in your eyes
And the smell of flowers blooming fills the air
Your mind is filled with the thoughts of a certain someone that you love
Your life is filled with joy when she is there

Love can make you happy
If you find someone who cares
To give a lifetime to you
And who has a love to share

If you think you've found someone you'll love forevermore
Then it's worth the price you'll have to pay (pay)
To have, to hold's important when forever is the phrase
That means the love you've found is going to stay

Love can make you happy
If you find someone who cares
To give a lifetime to you
And who has a love to share

La-love, la-love

Love can make you happy
Love can make you happy
Love can make you happy
