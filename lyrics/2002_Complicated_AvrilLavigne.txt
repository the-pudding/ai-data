101 ContributorsComplicated Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-huh, life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way it is

[Verse 1]
Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only
Let it be, you would see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me
One-on-one but you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryna be cool, you look like a fool to me, tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at
You see, you're makin' me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin'
Anyone when you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryna be cool, you look like a fool to me, tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no (No)
No (No), no, (No)
No (No), no, (No)
No (No), no (No), no, no (No)
[Bridge]
Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you will see

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool, you look like a fool to me, tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated? (Ay-yeah)
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no76Embed
