10 ContributorsShake You Down Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh-ooh...
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Girl, I've been watching you
From so far across the floor, now, baby
That's nothing new, I've watched you
So many times before, now, baby
I see that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
And what it’s telling me
And you know, ooh, girl, that I'm not shy
I'm glad you picked up on my telepathy, now, baby

[Chorus]
You read my mind (You know you did)
Girl I wanna shake you down (oh well, oh well)
I can give you all the lovin' you'll need
(I’m gonna love you)
Come on let me take you down (oh, baby)
We’ll go all the way to heaven

[Verse 2]
Ooooh, I been missing you
And the way you make me feel inside
What can I do?
I can tell you've got your pride now, baby
(Ooh...)

(Won't you come to me)
Let me ease your mind, oh, babe

Girl, I've been missing you
And you know, it's funny
Every time I get to feelin' this way
I wish I had you near me
I wanna reach out and touch you…

I can't stop thinking of the things we do
The way you call me, baby, when I'm holding you

Then you whisper in my ear, oh, baby, well, well
