Ah, your butt is mine, gon' tell you right, ah
Just show your face in broad daylight, ah
I'm tellin' you on who I feel, ah
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, ah, shamone
Lay it on me, ah, alright
Ah, I'm givin' you on count to three, ah
To show your stuff or let it be, ah
I'm tellin' you, just watch your mouth, ah
I know your game, hah, what you're about, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me, that's really true, ah
But my friend, you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone, ah (Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Bad, bad)
You know it, ah (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone (Bad, bad)
You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?
