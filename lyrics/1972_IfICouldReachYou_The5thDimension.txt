2 ContributorsIf I Could Reach You LyricsOh no, don't go
It's hours 'til dawn
And there's no one
Who'd rather be with you

I know you know
Other girls like me
I let you take my love
Knowing you don't love me

But if I could reach you some way
If I knew the magic it would take
To love you good enough on the outside
And make you feel it on the inside
Maybe I could make you stay
If I could reach you

The dark is getting light
And you're dressed to go
And never said a word
About tomorrow

But if I could reach you some way
If I knew the magic it would take
To love you good enough on the outside
And make you feel it on the inside
Maybe I could make you stay
You might also likeSee you next time
I'll see you next timeEmbed
