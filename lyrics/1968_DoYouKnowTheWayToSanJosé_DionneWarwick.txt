14 ContributorsDo You Know the Way to San Jose Lyrics[Chorus]
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I've been away so long, I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

[Verse 1]
L.A. is a great big freeway, put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were are parking cars and pumping gas

[Chorus]
You can really breathe in San Jose
They've got a lot of space, there'll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

[Verse 2]
Fame and fortune is a magnet, it can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend, you pack your car and ride away

[Chorus]
I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?

Oh, L.A. is a great big freeway, put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were are parking cars and pumping gas

[Outro]
I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Oh, oh, do you know the way to San Jose?
Hmm, can't wait to get back to San Jose1Embed
