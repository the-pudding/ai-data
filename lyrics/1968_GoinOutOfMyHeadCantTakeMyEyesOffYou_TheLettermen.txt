[Intro]
Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Over you
Over you

[Verse 1]
I want you to want me
I need you so badly
I can't think of anything but you

[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]

[Verse 2]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last, love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Goin' Out of My Head]
You might also like[Chorus]
Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right

[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]

[Bridge]
I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm the lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say
"Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you"

[Goin' Out of My Head]

[Verse 1]
I want you to want me
I need you so badly
I can't think of anything but you

[Chorus]
Goin' out of my head over you (Can't take my eyes off of you)
Out of my head (You're just too good to be true)
Out of my head, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
Night and day and night
[Outro]
And I think I'm goin' out of my headEmbed
