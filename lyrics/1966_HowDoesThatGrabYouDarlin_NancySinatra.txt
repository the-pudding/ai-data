4 ContributorsHow Does That Grab You, Darlinâ€™? Lyrics[Verse 1]
You came by at two o'clock
You shoulda been by at ten
I said bye at three o'clock
And I ain't coming back again, whoa

[Chorus]
How does that grab you, darlin'?
How does that mess your mind?
How does that grab you darlin'?
This girl is leavin' you behind

[Post-Chorus]
You smart alec tomcat, you

[Verse 2]
When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
I'm gonna go out and prowl, yeah
Don't come a-lookin' for your pussycat
'Cause I won't be here no how, whoa

[Chorus]
How does that grab you darlin'?
How does that mess your mind?
How does that grab you darlin'?
This girl is leavin' you behind
You might also like[Verse 3]
Now you ain't nothin' but an old tomcat
Runnin' around my house
I'll tell you something, you old tomcat
You just lost your mouse, whoa

[Chorus]
How does that grab you darlin'?
How does that mess your mind?
How does that grab you darlin'?
This girl is leavin' you behind

[Post-Chorus]
There's more than one way to skin a cat you know, rraow

[Outro]
Bye-byeEmbed
