7 ContributorsStep In The Name Of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Many lovers has come, and
Many lovers have gone
Similar to an old fashion song
(A thousand years from now
We'll be still putting it down my baby)
You can change the frame
But the picture remains the same
Similar to the sun after the rain
(Thousand years from now, we'll
Be still puttin' it down my baby)

[Pre hook]
Baby girl in other words for ever more
I'll be here. (I'll be here)
Cause, my whole has been full of joy every since
You came here...Girl

[Hook]
My whole world goes around
Because you spin me yeah (spin me)
And every time we're done making love girl
You makes me wanna

[Verse 2]
Some believes in love
And some people don't
Similar to a story, when it's told
A thousand years from now
We'll be still puttin' down my baby
Some have cross the finish line and some gave up
It's like moving a mountain
Love can be just that tough yeah
(A thousand years from now)
(We'll be still putting it down, my baby)
Baby girl in other words for ever more
I'll be here. (I'll be here.)
Cause my whole has been full of joy since
You came here...Girl

My whole world goes around
Because you spin me yeah (spin me)
And every time we're done making love girl
You makes me wanna

[Verse 3]
Now we gonna play a little game
And this game is for all of those who
Know how to follow the rules of this game. Aight?
Listen. When I sing, I want everybody out there
To do what ever I sing. Aight? Come on
Here we go

[Bridge]
Step Step Side to side
Round and round, Dip it now
Separate, bring it back...
Let me see you do the
Love slide

Step Step Side to side
Round and round, Dip it now
Separate, bring it back...
Let me see you do the
Love slide
[Hook]
My whole world goes around
Because you spin me yeah (spin me)
And every time we're done making love girl
You makes me wanna
My whole world goes around
Because you spin me yeah (spin me)
And every time we're done making love girl
You makes me wanna

[Outro]
Listen, Love brought us together
So keep on steppin' because
Love's gonna last forever

Clap in the name of love
Let's step out, hit the club
DJ's rockin' that song for us
If anybody ask, why we're steppin'
Tell them that:
We did it for love

Dedicated to Uncle Henry Love:Thank you!
Ohh, I love you Thank you2Embed
