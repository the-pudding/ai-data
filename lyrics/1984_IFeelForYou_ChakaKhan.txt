Chaka Khan, let me rock you
Let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan, let me rock you
Let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, 'cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan, would you tell me what you wanna do?
Do you feel for me, the way I feel for you?
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take you in my arms
Let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical dream
I wanna rock you, Chaka
Baby, 'cause you make me wanna scream
Let me rock you, rock you
