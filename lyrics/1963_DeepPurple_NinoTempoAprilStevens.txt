And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of my memory, you wander on back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night once again I hold you tight
Though you've gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat, sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

When the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of my memory, you wander on back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night once again I hold you tight
Though you've gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat, sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

And as long as my heart will beat, sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
And as long as my heart will beat, sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreamsYou might also like1Embed
