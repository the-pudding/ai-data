He goes on the prowl each night
Like an alley cat
Looking for some new delight
Like an alley cat

She can't trust him out of sight
There's no doubt of that
He just don't know wrong from right
Like an alley cat

He meets them
And loves them
And leaves them
Like that "Catsanova" does

That's no way to treat a pal
She should tell him "Scat!"
Aren't you sorry for that gal
And her alley cat?
You might also likeHe meets them
And loves them
And leaves them
Like that "Catsanova" does

He don't know what faithful means
There's no doubt of that
He's too busy makin' scenes
Like an alley cat

And that's the sad, sad tale of a lonesome quail
And her alley catEmbed
