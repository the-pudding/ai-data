'Til the world ends
Remix

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I, chimpanzees is hatin', but I take it all in stride
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side
Told you they'd revive your career, but somebody lied
I ain't talkin' poultry when I say this chicken's fried
Anyway, Britney
Why they so jealous that you teamed up with me?
Tell 'em they my son, yup, gyal 'em a mi pickney
Anyway, brembedell
What's that? I donâ€™t know, but Femme Fatale
Sniff, sniff, cries
I done slayed your whole entire **** life
Oh, you got some Epsom salt?
I done balled all day, you ain't touched the court
What? What, you tired? You need a break?
You was hot when? Ricki Lake

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good ish, th-th-th-this is the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch, dancin' in the dark
You notice what I'm wearin', I'm noticin' you starin'
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list, next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight
[Chorus: Kesha]
