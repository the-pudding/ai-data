71 ContributorsGrillz Lyrics[Intro: Jermaine Dupri, Paul Wall, Nelly]
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em, "Make me a grill"
Uh, uh
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold
Yo
We 'bout to start an epidemic with this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1: Nelly & Brandi Williams]
Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh), in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh), in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I
Open up your mouth, your grill gleamin' (Say what?)
Eyes stay low from the chiefin' (Chiefin')
I got a grill I call penny candy, you know what that mean?
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave you for nothing, only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood, just say

[Verse 2: Paul Wall & Jermaine Dupri]
What it do, baby? It's the iceman, Paul Wall (Yeah)
I got my mouth lookin' something like a disco ball (Yeah)
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is them thirty pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating (What?)
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (Come on)
My teeth are mind-blowin', givin' everybody chills
Call me George Foreman, 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grills
[Chorus: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall, Nelly & Paul Wall & *Jermaine Dupri*]
Smile for me, daddy (Woo)
Woo, what you lookin' at? Uh
Let me see your grill
Let you see my what?
Ya, ya grill (Uh), ya, ya, ya grill

Smile for me, daddy (Woo)
What you lookin' at? Uh
I wanna see your grill
You wanna see my what?
Ya, ya grill (Uh), ya, ya, ya grill
Add a whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold (*Kinfolk, come on*)

[Verse 3: Gipp, Ali, Paul Wall & Jermaine Dupri]
Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds (Hey)
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head (Hey)
You can catch me in my Too $hort drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em, you can spot 'em on the top and the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
Ain't dissin' nobody, but let's bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white (That's right)
These ho's can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same, got my name in the mold
Add a whole top diamond and the bottom rose gold (Come on)
[Chorus: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall & Nelly & Paul Wall]
Smile for me, daddy (Woo)
What you lookin' at? Uh
Let me see your grill
Let you see my what?
Ya, ya grill (Uh), ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em, "Make me a grill", she said
Smile for me, daddy (Woo)
What you lookin' at? (Uh)
I wanna see your grill
You wanna see my what?
Ya, ya grill (Uh), ya, ya, ya grill
Add a whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold

[Bridge: Brandi Williams & Jermaine Dupri]
(Sing to me) Boy, how'd you get your grill that way? (Huh?)
And how much did you pay?
Every time I see you, the first thing I wan' say, hey

[Chorus: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall & Nelly & Paul Wall]
Smile for me, daddy (Woo)
What you lookin' at? (Uh)
Let me see your grill
Let you see my what? (Hey)
Ya, ya grill (Uh), ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em, "Make me a grill," she said
Smile for me, daddy (Woo)
What you lookin' at? (Uh)

You wanna see my what?
Ya, ya grill (Uh), ya, ya, ya grill
Add a whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold (Come on)11Embed
