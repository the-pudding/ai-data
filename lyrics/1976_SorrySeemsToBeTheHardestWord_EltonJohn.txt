What have I gotta do to make you love me?
What have I gotta do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there?

[Verse 2]
What do I do to make you want me?
What have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

[Chorus]
It's sad (So sad), so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's gettin' more and more absurd
It's sad (So sad), so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
It's sad (So sad), so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's gettin' more and more absurd
It's sad (So sad), so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I do when lightning strikes me?
What have I gotta do?
What have I gotta do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word?7Embed
