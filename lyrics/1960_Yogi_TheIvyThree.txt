1 ContributorYogi Lyrics(Hey, Boo-Boo!)

I saw a kook, who was standing on his head
He flipped his lid, like he should have been in bed
I said, "What's this, man?"
He looked at me and said
I'm a Yogi
I'm a Yogi, baby
I'm a Yogi
I'm a Yogi, baby

Hey, Boo-Boo!

And then the cat started strutting on hot coals
He was wearing sneaks, but they were so full of holes
He sang right out from the bottom of his soles
I'm a Yogi
I'm a Yogi, baby
I'm a Yogi
I'm a Yogi, baby

Hey, Boo-Boo!

"Now listen here, baby," the Yogi man said
"It's all a matter of the mind -
Just commune with your innermost being
And, baby, you'll be just fine."

So I tried my best to dig my inner mе
I walked on coals, my hair below my knee
Until at last I heard mе say perfectly
I'm a Yogi
I'm a Yogi, baby
I'm a Yogi
I'm a Yogi, baby

Hey, Boo-Boo!
Hey, Boo-Boo!
Hey, Boo-Boo!Embed
