For your love
For your love

[Verse 1]
(For your love) I give you everything and more, and that's for sure
(For your love) I bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
(For your love) To thrill you with delight
I give you diamonds bright
There'll be days that will excite
They'll make you dream of me at night

[Chorus]
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Bridge]
For your love, for your love
I would give the stars above
For your love, for your love
I would give you all I could

[Refrain]
For your love
For your love

(For your love) I'd give the moon if it were mine to give
(For your love) I'd give the stars and the sun, for I live
(For your love) To thrill you with delight
I give you diamonds bright
There'll be days that will excite
They'll make you dream of me at night

[Chorus]
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love1Embed
