Come on, baby, let's, do the twist
Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this

[Chorus]
Ee-yah, twist, baby, baby, twist
Ooh-ooh-ooh-yeah just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist

[Verse 1]
My daddy is sleepin', and Mama ain't around
Yeah, Daddy's just sleepin', and Mama ain't around
We're gonna twist 'n' twist 'n' twist 'n'
'Til we tear the house down

[Chorus]
Come on and twist, yeah, baby, twist
Ooh-ooh-ooh-yeah just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist, ee-yah
