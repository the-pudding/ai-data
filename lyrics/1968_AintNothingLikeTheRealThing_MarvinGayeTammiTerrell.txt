Ooh, baby

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye and Both]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no, no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Oh, honey

[Verse 1: Tammi Terrell and Marvin Gaye]
I've got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
Ooh, I read your letters when you're not near
But they don't move me and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don't you know?

[Chorus: Both]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Verse 2; Tammi Terrell]
I play my game of fantasy
I pretend, but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me
You might also like[Bridge: Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell, and Both]
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
To make me feel better
So, let's stay together, (Oh, ooh)

[Verse 3: Marvin Gaye and Both]
I've got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone, I'm well aware
Nothing can take the place of your being there, Oh

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell, and Both]
So glad we've got the real thing, baby
So glad we've got the real thing
Oh, Marvin,, I know, honey
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby,, So glad, so glad, oh, darling
Ain't nothing like the real thing, Talk to me
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby,, Ooh, oh, I'm so glad
Ain't nothing like the real thing, Oh, oohEmbed
