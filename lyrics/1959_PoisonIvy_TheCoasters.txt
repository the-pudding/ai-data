[Verse 1]
She comes on like a rose but everybody knows
She'll get you in Dutch
You can look but you better not touch

[Chorus]
Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a-creepin', around

[Verse 2]
She's pretty as a daisy
But look out man she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin

[Chorus]
Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a-creepin', around

[Bridge]
Measles make you bumpy
And mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll fool ya
And whooping cough can cool ya
But poison ivy, Lord'll make you itch
You might also like[Verse 3]
You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratchin' like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

[Chorus]
Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a-creepin' around

[Bridge]
Measles make you bumpy
And mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll fool ya
And whooping cough can cool ya
But poison ivy, Lord'll make you itch

[Verse 3]
You're gonna need an ocean of calamine lotion
You'll be scratchin' like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

[Chorus]
Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a-creepin', around
