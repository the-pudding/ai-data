6 ContributorsWhat Will My Mary Say LyricsI must be going
(Don't go)
My heart is showing
(Don't go)

I better hurry away
If I don't leave
I'll be sorry
What will my Mary say?

Your lips are thrilling
My arms are willing
I know that I shouldn't stay
If I don't leave
I'll be sorry
What will my Mary say?

What would I do
If she should need me
And find me kissing you?
She's always trusted me completely
Her poor heart would break in two

I must be going
(Don't go)
My heart is showing
(Don't go)
