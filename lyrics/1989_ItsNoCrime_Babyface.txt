5 ContributorsItâ€™s No Crime LyricsCalling all cars

[Verse 1:]
I never thought that
I could feel this way
You came around
And brought about a change
In me

[Hook #1:]
I was a typical guy
You came along and blew my mind
You were running fast
I was running slow
Everybody said that it would not work

Love came
And set me free
You were standing there to rescue me

Love caught it
We thought
Why can't we be in love?
Well

[Chorus:]
Why?
It's no crime
If I'm guilty of love
Let me do my time
You might also likeWhy?
It's no crime
Everybody needs love
And baby
So do I

[Verse 2:]
You never thought love
Came so easily
No doubt about it
Never in your dreams
No way

[Hook #2:]
You were a typical girl
You came along and changed my world
I walk slow
You walk fast
Everybody said that it could not last

Love came inside of me
Never knew how good
Our love could be

Love caught it
We thought
Why can't we be in love?
Well
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I've spent half a lifetime
Waiting for someone
You say
I know it was you

They don't recommend it
I don't understand it
I've been reprimanded
'Cause I'm in love with you

Calling all cars

[Repeat Hook #2:]

Why, why

So do I
So do I

So do I
So do I
Oh so do I
[Repeat Chorus:]

And baby
Why?Embed
