Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting
Higher than the Empire State
My lover, she is waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses askin' 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're tryin' to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm tryin' hard to take it back

[Pre-Chorus: Nate Ruess]
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like fallin' down
I'll carry you home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now I know that I'm not all that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back, so let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[Bridge: Janelle Mon√°e & Nate Ruess]
Carry me home tonight
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Just carry me home tonight
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Carry me home tonight
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Just carry me home tonight
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
The moon is on my side, I have no reason to run
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
The angels never arrived, but I can hear the choir
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
So will someone come and carry me home?
[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[Outro: Nate Ruess]
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like fallin' down
I'll carry you home tonight109Embed
