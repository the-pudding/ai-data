1 ContributorYou Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Girl you got me feelin like, girl you got me feelin like
Yeah, let me paint the picture for you girl

[Verse]
What if the perfect person for you was there for you all along?
Through the thickness, through the thin that's the one you was calling on
You lonely you call they phone and you hoping that they gon' pick up
Lately you losing friends so you hoping that they don't switch up
Messages saying I miss you, I love you, I wanna see you
I was by your side when you were with the guys who wouldn't treat you right
Was there through all your sleepless nights
Plus I held your deepest, darkest secrets tight
Plus I'm the one you call the times you need advice
Plus you was always there all the times that I needed someone too
Plus around you I'm comfortable, you know you just gotta gimme the word and I'll be coming through
Loving you is easy cause you're beautiful, so maybe me and you would be the number two
Don't flush it down the drain, cause I love (what you are)
If you were mine then you'd never forget (what you are)
If you were mine then you would always get (what you need)
So bet that what I say is true, I think I need to be with you

[Hook]
Call me crazy, I can't help myself from thinking maybe I should be with (you babe)
And if it were to happen now or later down the road, I wouldn't trade you for the (whole wide world)
Maybe I'm crazy because lately I been thinking that I need to be with (you babe)
Baby you been heavy on my mind no joke, I know we ain't together now but I been holding on to hope
You might also like[Verse]
So I haven't been on a quest for love
I just been on quest for the best way I could confess my love
Or better yet express my love
But I can guarantee you this, you won't forget my love
I got that special love
The type to sooth you when you losing it cause I know what the pressure does to you
Even having dreams of making love to you
Lot of times you're on my mind I don't hit up your line, cause I'm afraid to be a bug to you
Sensitive for you cause girl I got infinite love for you
Maybe if you seen what I see
Then you would realize just why you need to be beside me
Girl you been on my psyche, and if love don't cost a thing then baby let's not make it pricey
I doubt you'll find another that's able to love you like me
Call you wifey because in my dreams it's (what you are)
And I would treat you like a queen because it's (what you are)
What does it take for you to see that I am (what you need)
So now you know just how I feel, so tell me what's the deal girl

[Hook]
Call me crazy, I can't help myself from thinking maybe I should be with (you babe)
And if it were to happen now or later down the road, I wouldn't trade you for the (whole wide world)
Maybe I'm crazy because lately I been thinking that I need to be with (you babe)
If you would pay attention close, you would know that it shouldn't be hard, searching for love you been looking too far

[Bridge]
So you should let me give you want (and what you need)
Girl I could be just everything you want (and what you need)
I got plenty plenty love for you (and what you need)
I want you to know that beautiful is (what you are)
Extraordinary far from usual is (what you are)
The reason I thought of making this move with you is (what you are)Embed
