The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

[Verse 2]
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

[Verse 2]
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too
Much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

[Verse 4]
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side
You might also like[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

[Chorus 2]
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

[Bridge]
The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

[Chorus 2]
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love
[Refrain]
The power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

[Outro]
The power of love
As I look into your eyes
The power of love
(The power of love)
