20 ContributorsBack on the Chain Gang Lyrics[Verse 1]
I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh
What hijacked my world that night
To a place in the past we've been cast out of? oh oh oh oh
Now we're back in the fight

[Chorus]
We're back on the train
Oh, back on the chain gang

[Verse 2]
A circumstance beyond our control, oh oh oh oh
The phone, the TV, and the news of the world
Got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh oh oh oh
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies

[Chorus]
Put us back on the train
Oh, back on the chain gang

[Bridge]
The powers that be that force us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees when I see what they've done to you
But I'll die as I stand here today knowing that deep in my heart
They'll fall to ruin one day for making us part
You might also like[Verse 3]
I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a break in the battle was your part, oh oh oh oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart

[Chorus]
Now we're back on the train
Oh, back on the chain gang1Embed
