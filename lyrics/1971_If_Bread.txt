If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show
The you I've come to know

[Verse 2]
If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me too

[Chorus]
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

[Verse 3]
If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

[Verse 4]
If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
You might also like[Chorus]
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away8Embed
