One, two, three, go (Yeah)
Ciara
Sex
Ciara
Here we go
(Talk to 'em)

[Verse 1: Ciara]
Your touch is so magic to me
The strangest things can happen
The way that you react to me
I wanna do something you can't imagine
Imagine if there was a million me's talkin' sexy to you like that
You think you can handle, boy
If I give you my squeeze and I need you to push it right back

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' till clothin' disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh baby

[Chorus: Ciara & Justin Timberlake]
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

Everything ain't what it seems, I wave my hands and I got you
And you feel so fly assistin' in me
But now it's my turn to watch you, I ain't gon' stop you
If you wanna crowd my neck, talk sexy to me like that
Just do what I taught you girl when I give you my heat
And I need you to push it right back

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' till clothing disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh baby

[Chorus: Ciara & Justin Timberlake]
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

[Bridge: Ciara & Justin Timberlake]

This is the part where we fall in love (Love, sugar)
Let's slow it down so we fall in love (Oh oh oh)
But don't stop whatcha doin' to me
Ciara (Bring it back)
[Chorus: Ciara & Justin Timberlake]
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic, uh
