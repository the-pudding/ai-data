7 ContributorsMr. Blue Lyrics[Intro]
Our guardian star lost all his glow the day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said no, and his silver turned to blue
Like him, I am doubtful that your love is true
But if you decide to call on me, ask for Mr. Blue

[Verse 1]
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me (I'm Mr. Blue)
Then prove it by goin' out on the sly
Provin' your love isn't true
Call me Mr. Blue

[Verse 2]
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry (I'm Mr. Blue)
Then turn around, headin' for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

[Bridge]
I stay at home at night (I stay at home)
Right by the phone at night (Right by the phone)
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mister
You might also like[Verse 3]
I won't tell you
While you paint the town (I'm Mr. Blue)
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm paintin' it, too
But I'm paintin' it blue
Call me Mr. Blue

[Outro]
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue1Embed
