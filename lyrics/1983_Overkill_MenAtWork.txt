20 ContributorsOverkill Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be all right
Perhaps it's just imagination

[Chorus]
And day after day it reappears
And night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

[Verse 2]
Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

[Chorus]
And day after day it reappears
And night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Come back another day

[Verse 3]
I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations that
I know will be all right
It's just overkill

[Chorus]
And day after day it reappears
And night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

[Outro]
Ghosts appear and fade away
Ghosts appear and fade away2Embed
