21 ContributorsAll I Have To Give Lyrics[Verse 1: Nick & Brian]
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car to get to you
I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

[Chorus: Brian & All]
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give (Give)

[Verse 2: Howie & AJ]
When you talk (When you talk)
Does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave (Does he leave)
When you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine
You might also like[Chorus: AJ & All]
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give (Oh-oh, to you)

[Bridge: Nick, Howie, (Brian) & AJ]
(Hey girl) Hey girl
I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
(Could never add up to)
All the love I have inside, inside of you

[Break: Kevin, Brian, (AJ) & All]
And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
All, all, all, all, all
Everything I have is for you
You, you, you, you, you, you
You're what I need (My, my, my love is)
All that I have to give (All that I have is for you)

[Chorus: Brian, AJ, (Nick) & All]
But my love is all I have to give
(My love is all)
Without you I don't think I could live
(I don't think that I can live without you)
I wish I could give the world to you
(I would give the world to you)
But love is all I have to give
(It's all that I have)
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give (to you)
[Reprise: Brian  & All]
Oh-oh-oh-oh! (I have to give)
Without you I don't think I can live
Give my world to you, baby
But love is all I have to give
That's all I got to give

[Outro: Howie, Brian & All]
But my love is all I have to give
(Yeah, yeah)
Without you I don't think I can live
(I don't think I can't live)
I wish I could give my world to you
But love is all I have to give (Oh-oh, oh!)4Embed
