I felt so wonderful, so very wonderful
Let's do it over again

Gina (Gina), Gina (Gina), I can't remember when
I've ever felt a kiss that made me feel like this
Let's do it over again

Look at you, oh, look at you
So warm, so sweet, so shy
Look at me, oh, look at me
I can't believe that I'm such a lucky guy

To have Gina, Gina all for my very own
It's much too wonderful, so very wonderful
To know that Gina is mine alone

Oh, look at you, oh, look at you
So warm, so sweet, so shy
Look at me, oh, look at me
I can't believe that I'm such a lucky guy

To have Gina (Gina), Gina (Gina) all for my very own
It's much too wonderful, so very wonderful
To know that Gina is mine (Gina is mine)
Gina is mine aloneSee Johnny Mathis LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also likeEmbed
