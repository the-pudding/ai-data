18 ContributorsAtlantis Lyrics[Intro: Donovan (Spoken)]
The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean
So great an area of land
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails

To the east, Africa was her neighbor
Across a short strait of sea miles
The great Egyptian age is but a remnant
Of the Atlantean culture

The antediluvian kings colonized the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships
To all corners of the Earth
On board were the twelve
The Poet, the Physician, the Farmer
The Scientist, the Magician
And the other so-called Gods of our legends
Though Gods they were
You might also likeAnd as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice and let us sing
And dance and ring in the new
Hail, Atlantis!
