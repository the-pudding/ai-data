I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
How we get so deep so fast?
Bae, stop playin', I'll beat your ass
You be on some toxic shit but I cannot get off this bitch, I
Haven't seen you in three months, I miss you, can I see you, bae?
Every time I see one of your pictures, that shit drives me crazy
Girl, I know you miss a nigga
Especially how I kiss it
Message say delivered
Why the fuck you keep goin' missing on me?
Every time he get back in the picture, you act different on me
Ayy, tell that nigga we gon' have to share you, I ain't trippin' on it
One more time might be the best for both of us
Maybe we should talk about it later when we sober up
Maybe we should keep it goin', maybe we should let it go
Feel like if it's meant it's what it is so just let it flow
Got somethin' to handle so I'ma be here for a couple hours
Figured out you like them, my assistant keep on sendin' flowers
They got they own business, tell me why the fuck they all in ours?
Mama raised a lot of things but she ain't raised no fuckin' coward
We went to the moon last time, I'm tryna go back
We been doin' our thing for a while but they don't know that
I be buyin' you all type of bags but you can't show that
I be playin' the cut until you come back

I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Thinkin' how we played out
Really I feel off about it but ain't never said it
We ain't gotta talk about it
They'll never know when I'm with you, I play a different role
Can't move off emotion, this shit deep now I got self-control
I ain't never tried to hold you, niggas try to high and low me
I can break it down in dumbest terms and show you how you owe me
Still try and back door me, I know how to go about it
I know everything but I treat you like I don't know about it
Wildin' in Skyami, we took shrooms and caught a different vibe
Bitches can't fuck with you, you the one, for real, I peep your style
I gotta get to it, I'm OT so it's gon' be a while
It feel a lil' better when I ain't seen you, yeah

[Chorus: Fridayy]
I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah2Embed
