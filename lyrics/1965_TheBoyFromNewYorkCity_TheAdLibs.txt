5 ContributorsThe Boy From New York City Lyrics[Chorus]
Ooo-wah, ooo-wah, cool, cool kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City
Ooo-wah, ooo-wah, c'mon kitty (Oh yeah)
Tell us about the boy from New York City

[Verse 1]
He's kind of tall
He's really fine
Some day I hope to make him mine, all mine
And he's neat
And oh so sweet
And just the way he looked at me
He swept me off my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooo wee, you ought to come and see
How he walks
And how he talks

[Chorus]
Ooo-wah, ooo-wah, cool, cool kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City

[Verse 2]
He's really down
And he's no clown
He has the finest penthouse I've ever seen in town
And he's cute
In his mohair suit
And he keeps his pockets full of spending loot
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Ooo wee, you ought to come and see
His pretty bar
And brand new car
Every time he says he loves me
Chills run down my spine
Every time he wants to kiss me, ooh
He makes me feel so fine, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooo-wah, ooo-wah, c'mon kitty (Oh yeah)
Tell us about the boy from New York City

[Verse 3]
He can dance
And make romance
That's when I fell in love
With just one glance
He was shy
And so was I
And now I know I'll never, ever say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooo wee, you ought to come and see
He's the most
From coast to coast
[Chorus]
Ooo-wah, ooo-wah, cool, cool kitty (Oh yeah)
Tell us about the boy from New York City (Oh yeah)
Ooo-wah, ooo-wah, c'mon kitty (Uh-huh)
Tell us about the boy from New York City (Uh-huh)
Ooo-wah, ooo-wah, cool, cool kitty (Oh yeah)
Tell us about the boy from New York City (Oh yeah)Embed
