25 ContributorsSilent Lucidity Lyrics[Intro]
Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream spinning (Spinning)
In your head (Spinning, spinning, spinning)
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake, you face the day
Your dream is over
Or has it just begun?

[Verse 1]
There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly, you hear and see
This magic new dimension

[Chorus]
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you in silent lucidity

[Bridge]
"Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
(Help me) Dream control
How are we feeling today, better?
Dream control (Help me)
Dream control (Help me)
Dream control (Help me)
Dream control (Help me)"

[Verse 2]
If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within come tumbling down
And a new world will begin
Living twice at once, you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head, master of illusion
Can you realize your dream's alive?
You can be the guide, but
[Chorus]
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you8Embed
