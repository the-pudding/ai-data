One, two, three
Oh! That's how element'ry?
It's gonna be
Come on, let's fall in love!

[Chorus]
It's easy
It's so easy
Like taking candy
Like taking candy
From a baby

Falling in love with you was
Easy for me
Easy for me
And you can do it too

[Chorus]
It's easy
It's so easy
Like taking candy
Like taking candy

Baby! There's nothing hard about love
Basicly, it's as easy as pie
The hard part
Is living without love
Without your love, baby! I would die

One, two, three
One, two, three

It's easy
It's so easy
Like taking candy
Like taking candy
From a baby, yeah!

One and one are two
One and one are two
I know you love me and, oh! Oh!
How I love you?
How I love you?
Don't try to fight it
[Chorus]
'Cuz it's easy
It's so easy
Like taking candy
Like taking candy
From a baby, hey!
