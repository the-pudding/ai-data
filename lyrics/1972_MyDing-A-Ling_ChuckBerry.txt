When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hangin' on a string
She told me it was my ding a ling ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling

[Verse 2]
When mamma took me to Sunday School
They tried to teach me the golden rule
Every time the choir would sing
I'd sit there and play with my ding a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling

[Verse 3]
When Pa started me to Grammar School
I found a place in the vestibule
And every time the bell would ring
They'd catch me playin' with my ding a ling
You might also like[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling

[Verse 4]
Once I was climbing the garden wall
Oh and I had an awful fall
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
But I never let go of my ding a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling

[Verse 5]
I remember the girl next door
We used to play house on the kitchen floor
She'd be the queen, I'd be the king
Together we'd play with my ding a ling a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
[Verse 6]
This here song, it is so sad
To those of you who never had
Silver bells hanging on a string
So you could play with your own ding a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
All come on now, everybody sing
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling (One more time)4Embed
