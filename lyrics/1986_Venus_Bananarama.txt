24 ContributorsVenus Lyrics[Verse 1]
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

[Chorus]
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

[Verse 2]
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man mad
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no one else had
Wow!

[Chorus]
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
