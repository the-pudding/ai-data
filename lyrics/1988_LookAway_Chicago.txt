10 ContributorsLook Away Lyrics[Verse 1: Bill Champlin]
When you called me up this morning, told me 'bout the new love you found
I said, "I'm happy for you, I'm really happy for you"
Found someone else, I guess I won't be coming 'round
I guess it's over, baby, it's really over, baby, woah
And from what you said, I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's gotta be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Chicago]
But if you see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
And if we meet on the streets someday and I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

[Verse 2: Bill Champlin]
When we both agreed as lovers we were better off as friends
That's how it had to be, yeah, that's how it had to be
I tell you I'm fine, but sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me, wish you were still holding me, woah
I just never thought that I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you
I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be
You might also like[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Chicago]
But if you see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
And if we meet on the streets someday and I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Chicago]
If you see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
And if we meet on the streets someday and I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me

[Post-Chorus: Bill Champlin, Chicago]
You see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

[Outro: Bill Champlin]
When you called me up this morning, told me about the new love you found
I said, "I'm happy for you, I'm really happy for you"2Embed
