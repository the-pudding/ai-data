23 ContributorsMake It with You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side?
I may be climbing on rainbows
But baby, here goes

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreams, they're for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
And if you're wondering what this all is leading to

[Chorus]
I wanna make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

[Verse 2]
No, you don't know me well
And every little thing, only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do
And we'll see it through

[Pre-Chorus]
Life can be short or long
Love can be right or wrong
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through
You might also like[Chorus]
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girl

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know that
Dreams, they're for those who sleep
Life, it's for us to keep
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through

[Chorus]
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it, girlEmbed
