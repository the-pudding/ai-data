Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Come on now

[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We three-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this-a-way? (Hey, must be the money)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this-a-way? (Hey, must be the money)

[Verse 1: Nelly]
In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, tryna spot something real nice
Looking for a little shawty I noticed
So that I can take her home (I can take her home)
She can be eighteen, eighteen with an attitude
Or nineteen, kinda snotty, acting real rude
Boo, as long as you a thicky, thicky, thick girl
You know that it's on (you know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (Ayy)
Saying she be peepin' and "I dig the last video"
"Somewhere, Nelly, can we go?" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34 (Nelly)
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you groovin' way over there
See Nelly LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We three-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this-a-way? (Hey, must be the money)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this-a-way? (Hey, must be the money)

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Mama poppin', face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots, she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shoppin' with plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that four dot six Range
Watch the candy paint change every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my mama
Put the whip in my own name now
Damn, shit done changed now
Runnin' credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (C'mon), I can't complain now (No more)
Shit, I'm the mayne now in and out my own town
I'm getting pages outta New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash, first class, sitting next to Vanna White (C'mon)
[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money)

[Bridge: Nelly]
Check, check, yo
I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won’t believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: "I can't help ya"
"But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?"
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

[Verse 3: City Spud]
Ayo, now that I'm a fly guy and I fly high
Niggas wanna know why, why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, "wishing you us" niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bub', mackin'
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy Cris', telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shawty wanna knock, we knocking to this
And if shawty wanna rock, we rocking to this
And if shawty wanna pop, we popping the Crist'
Shawty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen, Nelly talk, City listen
When I fuck fly bitches, when I walk, pay attention
See the ice and the gliss', niggas staring, know they diss
Honeys look, know they wish
Come on, boo, gimme kiss (C'mon)
[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
Hey, must be the money!
Hey, must be the money!
Hey, must be the money!
Must be the money!
