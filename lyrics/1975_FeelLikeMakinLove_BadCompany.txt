Baby, when I think about you
I think about love
Darlin', don't live without you
And your love

If I had, those golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you, in the heaven
'Til I'm dyin' (dyin', dyin',)
On the way

[Chorus]
Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

[Verse 2]
Baby, if I think about you
I Think about love
Darlin', if I live without you
I live without love
