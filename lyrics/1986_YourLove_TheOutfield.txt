65 ContributorsYour Love Lyrics[Verse 1: Tony Lewis]
Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older

[Chorus: Tony Lewis & Tony Lewis with John Spinks]
I just wanna use your love tonight
And I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[Verse 2: Tony Lewis & Tony Lewis with John Spinks]
I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it undercover

[Chorus: Tony Lewis & Tony Lewis with John Spinks]
I just wanna use your love tonight, oh
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[Bridge: Tony Lewis]
Try to stop my hands from shakin'
Somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we've been all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'
You might also like[Verse 3: Tony Lewis]
As you leave my place, won't you close the door?
And don't forget what I told ya:
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon

[Chorus: Tony Lewis & Tony Lewis with John Spinks]
I just wanna use your love tonight, yeah
I don't wanna lose your love tonight, yeah
And I just wanna use your love tonight
And I don't wanna lose your love tonight
And I just wanna use your love tonight
And I don't wanna lose your love tonight

[Outro]
(Use your love, lose your love) Your love
(Use your love) Well, I don't wanna lose
(Lose your... tonight) I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose (Use your... tonight) Your love
(Lose your... tonight) Your love, your love
(Use your... tonight) Your love
(I don't wanna lose your love tonight) Ah
(Use your... tonight) Your love31Embed
