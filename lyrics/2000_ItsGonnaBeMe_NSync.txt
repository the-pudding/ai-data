(It's gonna be me)
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin with Chris]
You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go
Oh oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in “no man, no cry”
Maybe that's why

[Chorus: All]
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what?
It's gonna be me

[Verse 2: JC with Chris & Justin]
You got no choice, babe
But to move on, you know
There ain't no time to waste
But you're just too blind (too blind)
To see
But in the end, you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why...
You might also like[Chorus: All, Justin, JC]
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally ('ly)
Get to love somebody (somebody)
Guess what?
It's gonna be me

[Interlude: Justin]
(It's gonna be me)
Ay, ay, ayy
Ooh yeah, yeah

[Middle 8: Justin]
There comes a day
When I'll be the one
You'll see
Lance: It's gonna...
Joey: Gonna...
Justin: Gonna...
JC: Gonna...
Chris: Gonna
It's gonna be me
[Bridge: All, Justin]
All that I do
Is not enough for you
I don't wanna lose it
But I'm not like that
When finally (finally)
You get to love (ah)
Guess what? (guess what?)

[Chorus: All, Justin, JC]
Every little thing I do (do)
Never seems enough for you (for you, babe)
You don't wanna lose it again (don't wanna lose it)
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally ('ly)
Get to love somebody (love...)
Guess what?
It's gonna be me
Every little thing I do (oh...)
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again (don't wanna lose it)
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally ('ly)
Get to love somebody (love somebody)
Guess what?
