Boy, there you go
You're tellin' me that you love me
When will you know
That you belong to another girl who loves you?

[Pre-Chorus: Coko, Taj & Lee Lee]
You are (So fine, so fine), fine
(So fine, blow my mind) You blow my mind
(Things you do) With the things you do to me
(She sees she's not blind) Blind
(Not blind to the) She's not blind
(Things you do, things you do for me)
Things you do for me
But I know

[Chorus]
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do (Don't know what to do)
Boy, you got me so confused (I'm so confused)
I don't know what I'm gonna do (Oh no)

[Verse 2: Coko]
Friends ask how could
I give myself to one who belongs to someone else
They just don't know
Your love's so good
That they would want it for themselves

I don't know what I'm gonna do (You're not mine, I can't deny)
Boy, you got me so confused (Don't know what to do)
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm so into you (If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right)
I don't know what I'm gonna do (Not tonight)
Boy, you got me so confused (You got me so confused)
I don't know what I'm gonna do (You make me sing)

Do-do, do-do, do, do (Ooh, what)
Do-do, do-do, do, do (Ooh, what)
Boy, you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do6Embed
