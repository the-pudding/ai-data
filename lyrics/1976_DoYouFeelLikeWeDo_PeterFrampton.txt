6 ContributorsDo You Feel Like We Do LyricsWoke up this morning with a wine glass in my hand
Whose wine, what wine, where the hell did I dine?
Must have been a dream. I don't believe where I've been
Come on - let's do it again

Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?

My friend got busted just the other day
They said don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away
He drove into a taxi. Bent the boot, hit the back
Had to play some music otherwise he'd crack

Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?

Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?

Champagne for breakfast and a sherman in my hand
White top, White tails, never fails
Must have been a dream. I don't believe where I've been
Come on - let's do it again

Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?You might also like1Embed
