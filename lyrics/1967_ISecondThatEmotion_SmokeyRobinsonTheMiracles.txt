15 ContributorsI Second That Emotion Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'd go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
I do believe that that would only break my heart, oh

[Chorus]
But if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion, ah

[Verse 2]
Maybe you think that love would tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
And so it makes you wise to break the rules

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
I do believe that that would only break my heart, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
But if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

[Break]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
I do believe that that would only break my heart, oh

[Chorus]
But if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

[Outro]
Oh, little girl, I second that emotion
Ooh, little girl, I second that emotionEmbed
