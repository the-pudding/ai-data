20 ContributorsCover Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
The times are tough now, just getting tougher
This old world is rough, it's just getting rougher
Cover me, come on baby, cover me
Well, I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me

[Verse 2]
Now promise me, baby, you won't let them find us
Hold me in your arms, let's let our love blind us
Cover me, shut the door and cover me
Ah, looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me

[Bridge]
Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more

[Verse 3]
This whole world is out there just trying to score
I've seen enough; I don't want to see any more
Cover me, come on in and cover me
I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me

Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more

[Verse 4]
This whole world is out there just trying to score
I've seen enough, ain't gonna see any more
Cover me, wrap your arms around me, cover me
Well, I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me

[Outro]
Ah, I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Yeah, I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Well, I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
Come on, baby4Embed
