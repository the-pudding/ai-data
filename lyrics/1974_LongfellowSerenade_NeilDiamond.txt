Longfellow Serenade
Such were the plans I'd made
For she was a lady
And I was a dreamer
With only words to trade

You know that I was born
For a night like this
Warmed by a stolen kiss
For I was lonely
And she was lonely

Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make your dreams come true
I'll sing my song
Let me sing my song
Let me make it warm for you

I'll weave his web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time
On his winged flight
Then come, and as we lay
Beside this sleepy glade
There I will sing to you
My Longfellow serenade

Such were the plans I made
But she was a lady
As deep as the river
And through the night we stayed
And in my way I loved her as none before
Loved her with words and more
For she was lonely and I was lonely

Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make your dreams come true
I'll sing my song
Let me sing my song
Let me make it warm for you

I'll weave his web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time
On his winged flight
Then come, and as we lay
Beside this sleepy glade
There I will sing to you
My Longfellow serenade

Weave your web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time
On your winged flight2Embed
