[Verse 1]
Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs because there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart beats like a drum (All night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (And it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside

[Chorus]
That you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby, that's okay
Our time, our way
So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world, our fight

[Pre-Chorus]
If we stand side by side (All night)
There's a chance we'll get by (And it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll be live
In my heart till the day that I die

[Chorus]
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart beats like a drum (All night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (And it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside

[Chorus]
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
