35 ContributorsWherever You Will Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Verse 2]
And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

[Pre-Chorus]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Bridge]
Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

[Verse 3]
I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Outro]
If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go33Embed
