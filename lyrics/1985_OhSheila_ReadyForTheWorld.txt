Like they always say, what's good for the goose
Is always good for the gander
Oh Sheila

[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, love me right
Let me love you till we get it right
Why can't you let the others be
Cause with you is where I got to be
Oh, suga, where you been?
Hangin' out with your male friends
Listen, somebody's gonna hurt you
The way you love to keep hurting me

[Chorus]
And we sing
Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you till the morning comes
(see the sun)
Oh, oh Sheila
You know I want to be the only one

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, understand
That I want to be the only man
But it seems as though it's getting too hard
And I think I'll start to have my own fun
Oh, baby, it's plain to see
That you're qualified to fill your needs
You think you've pulled one over on me
Well honey, baby, just you wait and see
