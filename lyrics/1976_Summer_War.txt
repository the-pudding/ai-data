5 ContributorsSummer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ridin' 'round town with all the windows down
Eight track playin' all your favorite sounds
The rhythm of the bongos fill the park
The street musicians tryin' to get a start

[Chorus]
'Cause it's summer
Summertime is here
Yes, it's summer
My time of year
Yes, it's summer
My time of year

[Verse 2]
Stretched out on a blanket in the sand (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Kids of all ages diggin' Disneyland (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Rappin' on the C.B. radio in your van (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We'll give a big "10-4" to the truckin' man

[Chorus]
'Cause it's summer
Summertime is here
Yes, it's summer
My time of year

In Atlantic City or out in Malibu (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Or anywhere between, I'm telling you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
When you feel those balmy breezes on your face (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Summertime is the best time, any place (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's summer
Summertime is here
Yes, it's summer
My time of year (Oh, oh)

[Outro]
'Cause it's summer (Summertime is here)
Summertime is here (Yeah)
Yes, it's summer
My time of yearEmbed
