21 ContributorsLocked Up (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Styles P]
Locked up, they won't let me out
And I had a long day in court, shit stress me out
Won't give me a bail, they can't get me out (Damn!)
Now I'm heading to the County, gotta do a bid here
I used to living luxurious, I don't wanna live here
The walls is gray, the clothes is orange
The phones is broke, the food is garbage
Lotta niggas is living with these circumstances
S.P.'s the same, I still merk your mans-es
Drug money to rap money, work advances
Niggas ran and told, I should've merked to Kansas
Got popped for a murder attempt
Knock me on D-Block when I was burnin' the hemp
Had a brick in the stash
Hope they don't take it to a further extent
Locked up and they won't let me out
When I hit my cellblock, niggas know the dread be out

[Verse 2: Akon]
I'm steady tryin' to find a motive (motive)
Why do what I do? (do)
The freedom ain't getting no closer (closer)
No matter how far I go (go)
My car is stolen (stolen)
No registration (-tration)
The cops patrollin' (patrollin')
And now they done stopped me

And I get locked up
They won't let me out

They won't let me out
They won't let me out

No, they won't let me out

[Verse 3: Akon]
Heading up town to re-up (re-up)
Back with a couple ki's (ki's)
The corner block's on fire (fire)
Undercovers dressed as fiends (fiends)
Making so much money (money)
Product's moving fast (fast)
Put away the stash
As I sold the last bag

[Chorus: Akon]
Fucked around and got locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
My nigga I'm locked up
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
I'm locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
Baby girl, I'm locked up
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
[Verse 4: Styles P]
Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
I'ma Ryde or Die and stay D-Blocked up
Two toothbrushes up, whoever want it with P
When I walk by, nigga, get up
‘Cause I'm locked up, they can't get me out
I smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out
Go and hit the bar when the wrecks be out
Can't wait for the day when they let me out

[Verse 5: Akon]
‘Cause visitation no longer comes by
It seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
My cellmates getting food without me
I can't wait to get out
And move forward with my life
(Move on with my life)
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right

[Chorus: Akon]
But instead I'm here locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
Oh! I'm locked up
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
My nigga I'm locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
Oh, oh, oh! I'm locked up
They won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
[Outro: Akon]
‘Cause I'm locked up
Where's my lawyer?
Get me out of here
Baby, I'm locked up
Where's my niggas on the block?
Tell them I'm locked up
I'm locked up
Can you please accept my phone call?
I'm locked up (...locked up...locked up...)8Embed
