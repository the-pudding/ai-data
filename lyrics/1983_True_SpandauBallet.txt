Huh huh uh-huh hi
Huh huh uh-huh hi

[Verse 1]
So true!
Funny how it seems
Always in time
But never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul!
This is the sound!
I bought a ticket to the world
But, now, I've come back again!
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh! I want the truth to be said

[Chorus]
Huh huh uh-huh hi
I know this much is true!
Huh huh uh-huh hi
I know this much is true!

[Verse 2]
With a thrill in my head
And a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin
All night long!
This is the sound of my soul!
This is the sound!
Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of its own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh! I want the truth to be known
You might also like[Chorus]
Huh huh uh-huh hi
I know this much is true!
Huh huh uh-huh hi
I know this much is true!

[Bridge]
I bought a ticket to the world

Huh huh uh-huh hi
I know this much is true!
Huh huh uh-huh hi
I know this much is true!
This much is true
