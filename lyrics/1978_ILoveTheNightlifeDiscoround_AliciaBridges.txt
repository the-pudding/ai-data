I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah
Oh, I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Please don't talk about love tonight
Please don't talk about sweet love
Please don't talk about bein' true
And all the trouble we've been through
Ah, please don't talk about all the plans we had
For fixin' this broken romance
I want to go where the people dance
I want some action, I wanna live

[Pre-Chorus]
Action, I got so much to give
I want to give it, I want to get some too
Oh, I, I, oh, I

[Chorus]
I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah
Oh, I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah

Please don't talk about love tonight
Yo' sweet talk won't make it right
Lovin', lies just bring me down
When you got women all over town
You can love them all and when you're through
Maybe that'll make, huh, a man outta you
I got to go where the people dance
I want some action, I wanna live

[Pre-Chorus]
Action, I got so much to give
I want to give it, I want to get some too
I, I, oh, I

[Chorus]
I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah
Oh, I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah

[Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah
Oh, I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh, I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah
Oh, I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love the nightlife, I got to boogie
On the disco 'round, oh, yeah
Oh, I love the nightlife…Embed
