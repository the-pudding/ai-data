Mr. Worldwide, T-Pain
El que no vale consejo, no llega viejo
So listen up
Let her go, la-la-la-la
Baby girl wanna play, let her go (Ah-ha)
Said let her go, la-la-la-la
Baby girl wanna play, let her go (Ah-ha)
Said let her go, la-la-la-la (Ah-ha)
Baby girl wanna play, let her go (Ah-ha)
Said let her go, la-la-la-la
Baby girl, wanna play, let her go
DÃ¡le, Pain

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey, baby girl, what you doin' tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store (Hey, hey, baby)
You're giving it your all when you're dancin' on me
I wanna see if you can gimme some more (Hey, hey, baby)
You can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want (Hey, hey, baby)
Pump it from the side, pump it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back and the front (Hey, hey, baby)
[Chorus: Pitbull & T-Pain]
Ooh, baby, baby, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ah-ha)
Ooh, baby, baby, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ah-ha)

Ooh, baby, baby, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Hey, hey, baby)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm a Dade county, self paid, self-made millionaire
I used to play around the world
Now I'm around the world, getting paid
Girl problems, no problems
Don't hate the game that won't solve it
I want to get with you, mami
Now let me see where the Lord split you (Dale)

Make money, make money
This chica right here gotta eat, baby
Scared money don't make money
That's how it goes in the street, baby
But enough with the the nonsense
Baby girl, take a shot to clear your conscience
Not a goon or a God, I'm a monster
'Cause I hit all baddest woman in the world, gangsta
