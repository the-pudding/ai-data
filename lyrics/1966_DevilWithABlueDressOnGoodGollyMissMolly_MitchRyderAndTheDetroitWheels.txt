Hey, hey
Alright
Jump up!
Get it, hey

[Chorus]
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with the blue dress on
Ooh, yeah
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with the blue dress on

[Verse 1]
Fee-fee, fi-fi, fo-fo, fum
Look at Molly now, here she come
Wearin' her wig-hat and shades to match
Got a-high heel shoes and an alligator hat
Wearin' her pearls and her diamond rings
Got bracelets on her fingers now and everything

[Chorus]
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
She's the devil with the blue dress on
Lord have mercy
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
Devil with the blue dress on
Hey
You might also like[Verse 2]
Wearin' her perfume, Chanel No. 5
Got to be the finest girl alive
She walks real cool, catches everybody's eye
The cats'll be nervous, they can't say hi
Not too skinny, she's not too fat
She's a real humdinger and I like it like that

[Chorus]
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
She's the devil with the blue dress on
Hey, I say now
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
The devil with the blue dress on

[Verse 3]
Good golly, Miss Molly, (Good golly, Miss Molly)
Oh yeah, you sure like to ball.  (Good golly, Miss Molly)
Yeah, yeah, good golly, Miss a-Molly, (Good golly, Miss Molly)
Ah, you know you sure like to ball (Good golly, Miss Molly)
It's late in the evening (Good golly, Miss Molly)
Don't you hear your mama call? (Good golly, Miss Molly)
Oh, from the early mornin', early mornin'
Till the early, early night
See Miss Molly rockin' at the House of Blue Light
Good golly, Miss Molly, (Good golly, Miss Molly)
You sure like to ball (Good golly, Miss Molly)
Oh yeah, you're rockin' and rollin'  (Good golly, Miss Molly)
Can't you hear your mama call?
Ahh
Hey, hey
[Verse 4]
Fee-fee, fi-fi, fo-fo, fum
Look at Molly now, here she come
Wearin' her wig-hat and shades to match
Got a-high heel shoes and an alligator hat
Wearin' her pearls and diamond rings
Got bracelets on her fingers now and everything

[Chorus]
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
She's the devil with the blue dress on
Ayy, I loves her
Devil with the blue dress, alright
Gonna sock it to me now
Yeah

Gotta, gotta, gotta jump up now

Gotta feel it, feel it.  (Devil with the blue dress on)Embed
