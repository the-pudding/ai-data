Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has his day
Everybody has to pay
Everybody has to meet his Waterloo
Now old Adam
Was the first in history
With an apple
He was tempted and deceived
Just for spite
The devil made him take a bite
And that's where old Adam
Met his Waterloo

Waterloo Waterloo
Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has his day
Everybody has to pay
Everybody has to meet his Waterloo
Little General Napoleon of France
Tried to conquer the world
But lost his pants
Met defeat
Known as Bonaparte's Retreat
And that's when Napoleon
Met his Waterloo

Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has his day
Everybody has to pay
Everybody has to meet his Waterloo

Now a feller
Whose darling proved untrue
Took her life
But he lost his too
Now he swings where the little birdie sings
And that's where Tom Dooley
Met his Waterloo

Waterloo Waterloo
Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has his day
Everybody has to pay
Everybody has to meet his WaterlooEmbed
