Well, I got a woman mean as she can be
Some-a-times I think she's almost mean as me

She gotta ruby lips, she got shapely hips, yeah
Boy, she makes ole Roy-oy flip
I got a woman mean as she can be
Some-a-times I think she's almost mean as me

Well I ain't braggin', it's understood
Everything I do, well I sure do it good
Yeah, I got a woman, mean as she can be
Some-a-times I think she's almost mean as me
Well

She gotta ruby lips, she got shapely hips, yeah
Boy, she makes ole Roy-oy flip
I got a woman, mean as she can be
Some-a-times I think she's almost mean as me, easy now
