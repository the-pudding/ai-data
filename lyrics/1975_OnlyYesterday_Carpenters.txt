13 ContributorsOnly Yesterday Lyrics[Verse 1]
After long enough of being alone
Everyone must face their share of loneliness
In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was going through
And waiting was all my heart could do

[Verse 2]
Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filling the world surrounding me

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever

[Chorus]
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday
You might also like[Verse 3]
I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us, share it with me
The best is about to be
And so much is left for us to see

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever

[Chorus]
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterdayEmbed
