10 ContributorsUnderstanding Lyrics[Chorus: Xscape]
What I need from you is understanding
How can we communicate
If you don't hear what I say
What I need from you is understanding
So simple as 1-2-3
Understanding is what we need

[Verse 1: Tiny]
You don't really know me
You just wanna do what you wanna do
That's not the way it should be, no
You should listen to me, boy
(You better listen to me, boy)
I try so very hard to make you understand
But the choices you make, baby, they're all demands, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Kandi & Tamika]
I try so very hard to keep our love alive
But you don't wanna meet me halfway
Then the understanding dies
There's no way that we can work it out
If we don't pull together
I don't mean to be demanding
But I want some understanding
I wanna be with you

[Verse 2: LaTocha]
I listen to you, baby
And I know the things you're going through
I try to understand
That's why I'm still with you, baby
(I'm still with you)
See, every day we're living
Is one thing that will always be unsure
That's why I need you, baby, pleading, baby
Please let our love endure

[Pre-Chorus: Kandi & Tamika]
I try so very hard to keep our love alive
But you don't wanna meet me halfway
Then the understanding dies
And there's no way that we can work it out
If we don't pull together
I don't mean to be demanding
But I want some understanding
I wanna be with you
[Chorus: Xscape]
What I need from you is understanding
How can we communicate
If you don't hear what I say

So simple as 1-2-3
(Can't you see, 1-2-3)
Understanding is what we need

[Bridge: LaTocha]
All I need, all I need
All I need is understand
How, if you don't hear what I say
Can't you see...
Ooh ooh

But I want some understanding
I wanna be with you
