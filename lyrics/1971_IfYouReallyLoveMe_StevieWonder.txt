And if you really love me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
And if you really need me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
Then I won't have to be
Playing around

[Verse 1]
You call my name, ooh, so sweet
To make your kiss incomplete
When your mood is clear
You quickly change your ways
Then you say I'm untrue
What am I supposed to do?
Be a fool who sits alone waiting for you?

[Chorus]
But if you really love me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
And if you really need me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
Then I won't have to be
Playing around

[Verse 2]
I see the light of your smile
Calling me all the while
You are saying, "Baby, it's time to go"
First the feeling's alright
Then it's gone from sight
So I'm taking out this time to say, whoa
You might also like[Alternate Chorus]
Oh, if you really love me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
And if you really need me
Won't you tell me, baby? Tell me
Then I won't have to be
Playing around, no
Playing around, no

[Outro]
Hey, yeah
Goofing around, no
Oh baby
Playing around, no
Let me know how you feel, baby
Hey, oh baby
Playing around no, oh
Hey, goofin' around, baby...1Embed
