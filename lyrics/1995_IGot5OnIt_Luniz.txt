Creep on in, on in, on in
Woah
See, I'm ridin' high, woah
Kinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got is five, I got five

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I-D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like the cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty
And when it comes to getting another stogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi (Shinobi)
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit Bit
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
'Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb, da-dumb-dumb
I come to school (Nyoom) with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoidin' all the dick teasers, skeezers and weirdos
That be blowin' off the land like, "Where the bomb at?"
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more growin' pains than Maggie
'Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on it
Partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Numskull & Michael Marshall]
I take sacks to the face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow, so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (Hahahaha)
'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell, no! You better bring your own spliff, chief (Five on it)
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the joint
Stop hittin' 'cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
'Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my PO
I know I failed 'cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me
[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
Partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 3: Numskull & Yukmouth]
Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thang got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashishs
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low-budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land gettin' smoked with my kinfolk, Ibeen smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down
Up in the O-A-K, the Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja (Wouh)
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do, kick in feed
'Cause where I be, we needs half like Umfufu
[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
Partner, let's go half on a sack62Embed
