One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out, pretty mama
What turns on your lights

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons and you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

[Chorus]
Ooh, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

[Verse 2]
One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one
Mmm, one that really screams

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her, but she's nowhere in sight

Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

[Outro]
(One of these nights)
Mmm, in between the dark and the light
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get you, baby, one of these nights
(One of these nights)
Hoo, hoo-hoo
Hoo, hoo-hoo
(One of these nights)
I can feel you
I can feel
(One of these nights)
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you, now
(One of these nights)
And it gets so dark
So dark and cold and lonely
One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
(One of these nights)
Swear I'm gonna find you
Comin' right behind you, now
(One of these nights)
Hoo, hoohoooo
(One of these nights)
And I wanna say, ahhh
(One of these nights)
Ahh, one of these, one of these
(One of these nights)
Ahh, comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
(One of these nights)
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
(One of these nights)11Embed
