Galveston, oh Galveston
I still hear your sea winds blowin'
I still see her dark eyes glowin'
She was twenty-one
When I left Galveston

[Verse 2]
Galveston, oh Galveston
I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannons flashing
I clean my gun
And dream of Galveston

[Bridge]
I still see her standing by the water
Standing there lookin' out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run

[Verse 3]
Galveston, oh Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch
Your sea birds flying in the sun
You might also like[Outro]
At Galveston
