31 Contributors7 Lyrics[Chorus]
All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all space and time
So don't cry
One day all seven will die

[Chorus]
All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all space and time
So don't cry
One day all seven will die

[Verse 1]
And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand, she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet (One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four)
But behold, we will watch them fall
And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us, animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love, only blasphemy
And in the distance, six others will curse me
But that's all right (That's all right)
For I will watch them fall
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven)
You might also like[Chorus]
All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect (Huh), and a savoir faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all space and time
So don't cry
One day all seven will die
(Just how old?)

[Verse 2]
And we will see a plague and a river of blood (Ah)
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their seven tears, but do not fear
For in the distance, twelve souls from now
You and me will still be here
We will still be here
There will be a new city with streets of gold (Ah-ah-ah)
The young so educated, they never grow old
And, uh, there will be no death for with every breath
The voice of many colors sings a song that's so bold
Sing it while we watch them fall

[Chorus]
All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all space and time
So don't cry
One day all seven will die
[Outro]
(Just how old?)
(Just how old?)
(Just how old?)5Embed
