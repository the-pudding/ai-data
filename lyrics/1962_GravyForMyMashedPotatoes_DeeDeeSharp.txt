(C'mon baby, I need gravy)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gravy tonight!

[Verse 1]
I know you danced to Mashed Potato Time
But that don't show me that you're really mine
What's your dancin', without romancin'?
So put that somethin' extra on the line

[Chorus]
Gimme (Gravy)
On my mash potatoes
Gimme (Gravy)
C'mon and treat me right
Gimme (Gravy)
Baby, you're the greatest
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gravy tonight!

[Verse 2]
I dig this twistin' but I want some more
There's somethin' missin' while we're on the floor
C'mon baby, I want some gravy
A little kissin's what I'm waiting for
You might also like[Chorus]
Gimme (Gravy)
For my mash potatoes
Gimme (Gravy)
C'mon and kiss me right
Gimme (Gravy)
Baby, you're the greatest
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gravy tonight!

Yeah!

[Verse 3]
Now when the Mash Potato's finally through
There's lots of groovy, gravy things to do
Lot's of lovin', kiss n' huggin'
I wanna ride that gravy train with you

[Chorus]
Gimme (gravy)
On my mash potatoes
Gimme (gravy)
C'mon and hold me tight
Gimme (gravy)
Baby, you're the greatest
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gravy tonight
Gimme (gravy)
On my mash potatoes
Gimme (gravy)
C'mon and treat me right
Gimme (gravy)

[Outro]
Baby, you're the greatest
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gravy tonight
GimmeEmbed
