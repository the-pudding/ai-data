3 ContributorsAre You Really Mine Lyrics(Really, really, really, are you really mine?)
(Really, really, really, are you really mine?)

You tell me that you love me
And you tell me that you want me
And you even wear my graduation ring

(Doo-wah) It's too wonderful
(Doo-wah) It's too beautiful
(Doo-wah) It's a fantastic thing

Are you really, really mine? (Really mine)
Really mine (Really mine)
Really mine
Will my lucky little star (Little star)
Really shine (Really shine)
Really shine

Kiss me with feeling
Make my heart go reeling
Make me know that you are really, really, really mine

(Really, really, really, are you really mine?)
(Really, really, really, are you really mine?)

You call me every morning
And you see me every evening
And you swear that I'm the only one for you
You might also like(Doo-wah) Here's the funny part
(Doo-wah) Though you cross your heart
(Doo-wah) I can't believe it's true

Are you really, really mine? (Really mine)
Really mine (Really mine)
Really mine
Will my lucky little star (Little star)
Really shine (Really shine)
Really shine

Kiss me with feeling
Make my heart go reeling
Make me know that you are really, really, really mine

(Really, really, really, are you really mine?)
Really mine
(Really, really, really, are you really mine?)
Really mine
(Really, really, really, are you really mine?)
Really mine
(Really, really, really, are you really mine?)
Really mineEmbed
