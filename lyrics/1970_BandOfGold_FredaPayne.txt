Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

[Verse 1]
You took me from the shelter of my Mother
I had never known or love any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

[Verse 2]
I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

[Chorus]
Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were just here, here with me

[Bridge]
Ohhhhhhhhh...

[Verse 3]
Don't ya know that I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'd walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

[Chorus]
Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me
Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of goldEmbed
