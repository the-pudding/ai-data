Little surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
(Surfer girl, my little surfer girl)

[Verse 2]
I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
(Surfer girl, surfer girl)

[Bridge]
We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my Woody I would take you everywhere I go

[Verse 3]
So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

Little one (Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl)
