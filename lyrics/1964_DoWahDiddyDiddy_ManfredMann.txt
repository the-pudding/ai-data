There she was just walkin' down the street
Singin', "Do wah diddy, diddy, dum diddy do"
Snappin' her fingers and shufflin' her feet
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do"

[Hook 1]
She looked good (Looked good)
She looked fine (Looked fine)
She looked good, she looked fine
And I nearly lost my mind

[Verse 2]
Before I knew it she was walkin' next to me
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do"
Holdin' my hand just as natural as can be
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do"

[Hook 2]
We walked on (Walked on)
To my door (My door)
We walked on to my door
Then we kissed a little more

[Bridge]
Whoa, oh
I knew we was falling in love
Yes, I did and so I told her
All the things, I'd been dreamin' of
You might also like[Verse 3]
Now we're together nearly every single day
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do"
We're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do"

[Hook 3]
Well, I'm hers (I'm hers)
She's mine (She's mine)
I'm hers, she's mine
Wedding bells are gonna chime

[Bridge]
Whoa, oh
I knew we was falling in love
Yes, I did and so I told her
All the things, I'd been dreamin' of

[Verse 3]
Now we're together nearly every single day
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do"
We're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay
Singin', "Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do"

[Hook 3]
Well, I'm hers (I'm hers)
She's mine (She's mine)
I'm hers, she's mine
Wedding bells are gonna chime
[Outro]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do, we'll sing it
Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do
Do wah diddy diddy, dum diddy do2Embed
