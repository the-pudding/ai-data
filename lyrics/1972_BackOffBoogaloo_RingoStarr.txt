Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo

[Verse 1]
Back off, boogaloo
Whatcha think you're gonna do?
I gotta flash right from the start

[Verse 2]
Wake up, meat head
Don't pretend that you are dead
Get yourself up off the cart

[Pre-Chorus]
Get yourself together now
And give me somethin' tasty
Everything you try to do
You know it sure sounds wasted

[Chorus]
Back off, boogaloo
I said, back off, boogaloo

[Verse 3]
You think you're a groove
Standin' there in your wallpaper shoes
And your socks that match your eyes

And give me somethin' tasty
Everything you try to do
You know it sure sounds wasted

[Verse 1]
Back off, boogaloo
Whatcha think I'm gonna do?
