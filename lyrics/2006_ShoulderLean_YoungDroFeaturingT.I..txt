Dro! I'm clean in this bitch (Okay)

This Grand Hustle, team of kings is getting rich
I lean and get lit, lima bean Six
I take breath, the opposite of Primatene Mist (Yeah)
I ride twenty-six and let my nine screens flip (Yuh)
Dro be watching Oprah, Mac 9 up in a clip
Triple-black Phantom (Okay), nigga, nah, it ain't Tip (What's up)

Hey, bounce (Bounce), okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk, and I bet my motor clean (Okay)
Suicide-door brown Rover look like pork and beans (Okay)
Everybody know me in the club 'cause they smoking me

Hundred karats have 'em froze for an eon (Okay now)
Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm riding Deion
Put them lights off in my rims (Ayy, okay), now I'm riding neon

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
First, I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
Ahh, then, I pimp a ho, take a bitch to Berlin
My bitch break niggas; after that, we fuck they girlfriends
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cocking hammer, Arm and Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimping in linen and salamander sandals
Dirty South hot 'cause Atlanta, show niggas with ana'
We ride Phantom, holler "Shawty" for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET our channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumping and punking monkeys (Okay)
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies (Okay)
Doughnut dunkin', bitch, I ride glazed on the haze
Gator-green Chevy, gator guts, alligator J's
