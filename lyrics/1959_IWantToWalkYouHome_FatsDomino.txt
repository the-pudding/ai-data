Please let me walk you home
I want to walk you home
Please let me walk you home
You look so good to me oowee
I wish I was a lucky guy
You've been walking right on

I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk
I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk
I'm not trying to be smart
I'm not trying to break your heart
But if I ask you for a date
Then you tell me that I'm not too late

I want to hold your hand
Please let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
Please let me hold your hand
You look so good to me oowee
I saw you walking all alone
That's why when I walk you home

So let me walk you home
Please let me walk you home
I wanna walk you home
Please let me walk you home
You look so good to me oowee

That's why I want to walk you home...
