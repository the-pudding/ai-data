Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

[Chorus]
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm going to treat you right

[Chorus]
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Bridge]
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her he said
"Julie Baby, you're my flame"

[Chorus]
"Thou giveth fever
When we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah I burn, forsooth"

[Verse 4]
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said, "Daddy, oh don't you dare"

[Chorus]
"He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his missus
Daddy won't you treat him right?"
[Verse 5]
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

[Chorus]
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever, if you live you learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn

[Outro]
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn2Embed
