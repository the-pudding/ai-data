14 ContributorsIâ€™d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony) Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to build the world a home
And furnish it with love
Grow apple trees and honey bees
And snow white turtle doves

[Chorus]
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms
And keep it company

[Verse 1]
I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace through out the land
(That's the song I hear)

[Chorus 2]
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to build the world a home
And furnish it with love
Grow apple trees and honey bees
And snow white turtle doves
You might also like[Chorus]
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms
And keep it company

[Verse 1]
I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace through out the land
(That's the song I hear)

[Chorus 2]
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony

[Outro]
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony, that's the song I hearEmbed
