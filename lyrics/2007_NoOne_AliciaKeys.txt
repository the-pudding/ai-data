55 ContributorsNo One Lyrics[Verse 1]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Verse 2]
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

[Bridge]
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So 'til the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
