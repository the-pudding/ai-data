Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you, hoo-ooh-hoo-hoo

[Verse 1]
I'm like a rubber ball, baby, that's all that I am to you
(Bouncy-bouncy, bouncy-bouncy)
Just a rubber ball 'cause you think you can be true to two
(Bouncy-bouncy, bouncy-bouncy)

[Chorus 1]
You bounce my heart around
(You don't even put her down)
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you

[Bridge]
If you stretch my love 'til it's thin enough to tear
I'll just stretch my arms to reach you anywhere
And like a rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 1]
You bounce my heart around
(You don't even put her down)
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you, hoo-ooh-hoo-hoo

[Verse 2]
I'm like a rubber band when on my shoulder you do tap
(Bouncy-bouncy, bouncy-bouncy)
Just a rubber band because my heartstrings, they just snap
(Bouncy-bouncy, bouncy-bouncy)

[Chorus 2]
You go and squeeze me 'til I'm all aflame
(She calls you by some other guy's name)
But like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you

[Outro]
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
