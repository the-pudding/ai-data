I don't mind
Lettin' you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, but just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on

[Pre-Chorus]
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? (Ooh, uh-uh)
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?

[Chorus]
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone?

[Verse 2]
Where you're from
You might be the one who's runnin' things
Well, you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
You see, it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? (Mm, uh-uh)
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you? (Oh, uh-uh)

[Chorus]
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone?
Ain't it good to be on your own? (Oh-oh-oh)
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one? (Oh-oh-oh)
Ain't it good to be on your own? (Ah-ah-ah)
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one? (Ah-ah-ah)
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good, ain't it goo-oo-ood
Bein' all alone?
