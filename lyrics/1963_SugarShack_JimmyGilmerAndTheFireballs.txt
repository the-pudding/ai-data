Oh, there's a crazy little shack
Beyond the tracks
And everybody calls it
The Sugar Shack

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, it's just a coffeehouse
And it's made out of wood
Expresso coffee tastes
Mighty good
That's not the reason why
I've gotta get back

[Chorus]
Oh, to that Sugar Shack
Whoa, baby, to that Sugar Shack

[Verse 2]
Oh, there's this cute little girlie
She's a-working there
A black leotard
And her feet are bare

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm gonna drink a lot of coffee
Spend a little cash
Make that girl love me
When I put on some trash
You can understand why
I've gotta get back
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, to that Sugar Shack
Whoa, baby, to that Sugar Shack
Yeah, honey, to that Sugar Shack
Whoa, yes, to that Sugar Shack

[Verse 3]
And now that Sugar Shack queen
Is a-married to me, yeah, yeah
We just sit around and dream
Of those old memories

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Ah, but one of these days
I'm gonna lay down tracks
In the direction
Of that Sugar Shack
Just me and her, yes
We're gonna go back

[Outro]
Oh, to that Sugar Shack
Whoa, oh, to that Sugar Shack
Yeah, honey, to our Sugar Shack
Yeah, yeah, yeah, our Sugar Shack...Embed
