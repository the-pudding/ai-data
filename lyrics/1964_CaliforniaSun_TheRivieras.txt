5 ContributorsCalifornia Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I'm goin' out west where I belong
Where the days are short, and the nights are long

[Chorus]
Where they walk, and I'll walk
They twist, and I'll twist
They shimmy, and I'll shimmy
They fly, and I'll fly
Well, they're out there a-havin' fun
In that warm California sun

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm goin' out west out on the coast
Where the California girls are really the most

[Chorus]
Where they walk, and I'll walk
They twist, and I'll twist
They shimmy, and I'll shimmy
They fly, and I'll fly
Well, they're out there a-havin' fun
In that warm California sun

Well, the girls are frisky in old 'Frisco
A pretty little chick wherever you go

[Chorus]
And they walk, and I'll walk
They twist, and I'll twist
They shimmy, and I'll shimmy
They fly, and I'll fly
Well, they're out there a-havin' fun
In that warm California sun

[Outro]
Yeah, they're out there a-havin' fun
In that warm California sunEmbed
