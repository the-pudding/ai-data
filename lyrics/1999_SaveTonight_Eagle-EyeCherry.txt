24 ContributorsSave Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Go on and close
The curtains
'Cause all we need
Is candlelight
You and me
And a bottle of wine
Gonna hold you tonight
Uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we know
I'm going away
And how I wish
I wish it weren't so
So, take this wine
And drink with me
Let's delay our misery

[Chorus]
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

There's a log
On the fire
And it burns
Like me for you
Tomorrow comes
With one desire
To take me away
Oh, it's true

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain't easy
To say goodbye
Darling, please
Don't start to cry
'Cause, girl, you know I've got to go
Oh
And, Lord, I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus]
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
[Pre-Chorus]
Tomorrow comes
To take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
Girl, you know I've got to go
Oh
Lord, I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus]
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

[Chorus]
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
[Post-Chorus]
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone

[Outro]
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Oh, that's right?
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Yeah, that's right?14Embed
