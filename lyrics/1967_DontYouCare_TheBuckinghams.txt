2 ContributorsDon’t You Care LyricsIf you don't love me
Why don't you tell me
Instead of running around
With all the other guys in town
Can't you see
You're hurting me
Don't you care
Don't you care

If you don't want me
Why don't you tell me
Instead of telling lies
And making me cry
Can't you see
You're hurting me
Don't you care
Don't you care

Whatever happened
To all the good times we used to have
The times we cried and laughed
I want to know, I want to know
Will you ever love me again
Or will I find out that this is the end
Don't you care
My my my my baby
You might also likeYou said that you'd believe me
Then why'd you ever leave me
I'm standing here all alone
Without a girl of my own
Can't you see
You're hurting me
Don't you care
Don't you care

Don't you care
Don't you care
Don't you care
Don't you care
Don't you care
Don't you careEmbed
