I'm comin' home, I've done my time
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter tellin' you, I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me
If you still want me

[Chorus: Tony Orlando, Telma Hopkins, Joyce Vincent Wilson & Both]
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
It's been three long years
Do ya still want me? (Still want me?)
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree

[Verse 2: Tony Orlando]
Bus driver, please look for me
'Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison
And my love she holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free
I wrote and told her, "Please"

[Chorus: Tony Orlando, Telma Hopkins, Joyce Vincent Wilson & Both]
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
It's been three long years
Do ya still want me? (Still want me?)
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree

[Bridge: Tony Orlando, Telma Hopkins & Joyce Vincent Wilson]
Now the whole damned bus is cheerin'
And I can't believe I see
A hundred yellow ribbons 'round the ole oak tree
('Round the ole oak tree)
I'm coming home (Mmm, mmm)

[Outro: Telma Hopkins & Joyce Vincent Wilson]
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)Embed
