There comes a time
When we heed a certain call

[Nicole Scherzinger, Jennifer Hudson & Justin Bieber]
When the world must come together as one

[Jennifer Hudson]
There are people dying

[Jennifer Nettles]
And it's time to lend a hand to life

[Jennifer Nettles & Josh Groban]
The greatest gift of all

[Josh Groban]
We can't go on
Pretending day by day

[Tony Bennett]
That someone somehow will soon make a change

[Mary J. Blige]
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
You might also like[Mary J. Blige & Toni Braxton]
Love is all we need

[Chorus: Michael & Janet Jackson, Barbra Streisand]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus, Enrique Iglesias, Nicole Scherzinger, Jamie Foxx]
Well, send them your heart
So they'll know that someone cares
So their cries for help
Will not be in vain
We can't let them suffer
No, we cannot turn away
Right now they need a helping hand

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Adam Levine, P!nk, BeBe Winans]
Nou sé mond la
We are the Children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
[Verse 3: Michael Jackson, Usher, Céline Dion, Fergie]
When you're down and out
And there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come when we
Stand together as one

[Chorus]
[Everyone]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

[Nick Jonas]
Better start giving

[Everyone]
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives

[Toni Braxton]
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
[Mary Mary]
We are the world
We are the children

[Tony Bennett]
It's for the children

[Isaac Slade]
We are the ones who make a brighter day

[Toni Braxton]
So let's start giving

[Lil Wayne]
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Everyone]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

[Akon]
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

[Fergie]
Come on now let me hear you

[T-Pain]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

[Jamie Foxx]
Choice were making
Saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Verse 4: LL Cool J, will.i.am, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes & Swizz Beatz]
We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dream's gone
When the earthquakes we'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the world united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road you're walking on
A signpost to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the world connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet's singing along

[Chorus: All]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

[Bridge: Kanye West, Wyclef Jean & Choir, will.i.am]
Everyday citizens
Everybody pitching in
Nou sé mond la
Nou sé timoun yo
You and I
You and I
Uh, twelve days, no water
What's your will to live?
We amplified the love we watching multiply
Feeling like the world's end
We can make the world win
Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
And now Haiti needs us, they need us, they need us

[Chorus: All]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Nou sé mond la
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

[Outro: Wyclef Jean]
Haiti, Haiti, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
