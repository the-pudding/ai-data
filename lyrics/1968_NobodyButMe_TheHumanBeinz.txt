1 ContributorPULSE Lyrics[Spoken]
You know I’m unstoppable
I’m rapping with a mouth full of blood

[Verse 1]
Say
I ask you, “Do you wanna see a ghost?”
The net is where they trap the soul
Apparitions on the phone
One missed call, you pay the toll
I heard you got the ring
That’s seven days for ya
Samara come up out that well
There’ll be no tape on ya
Steady sayin’ ugh like I gotta grudge
I’m just tired of all these cappin’ rappers
Oh my gosh (Say)
These flunkies killin’ they character for the internet
I talked to my bros ‘bout yo post
I.G., we ain’t in to that
And you may get verified
But my wholе squad got some blue checks
But you knеw that (yeah)

[Refrain]
Kairo, I say check the pulse
The afterlife is finite
I’m seeing shadows on the wall
Kairo, I say check the pulse
It was D.O.A when they saw me
It ain’t no tellin’ what they saw
You might also like[Verse 2]
I found myself in isolation
It was nobody but me
Driving myself crazy in a human beinz
And in the end
I dropped six hot ones
Call up Sean Evans, I think I got sum
A hot one, not two
Who at the top? It’s me & you
Talkin’ to myself at Linkin Park
Keep building all the walls
A titan, fightin’, Yaegar
Boss of ‘em all
You tryna win or draw?
And when I’m gone
You’ll know it’s me
I’ll leave my shadow on the wall yeah

[Refrain]
Kairo, I say check the pulse
The afterlife is finite
I’m seeing shadows on the hold up-
Kairo, I say check the pulse
The afterlife is fin-

[Segue]
Switch it up on ‘em
Uh, yeah
[Verse 3]
Kodokushi, it’s only me
Hikikomori, I know it get lonely
He hear the beat, his daddy scream
(Son!)
Ain’t gotta touch him for him to come with me
I’m everywhere at the end of time
But ain’t no caretaker, may I remind?
So don’t forget when Mikal around
Don’t play cause I gotta three-headed hellhound
And never beg ‘cause Jordan dead
It’s a new era so I’m cuttin’ off heads
This is yo last warning
ShhhEmbed
