5 ContributorsGirl Watcher LyricsI'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Watchin' girls go by
My, my, my

I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Here comes one now
Mmmm, mmm, mmm

I was just a boy
When I threw away my toys
I found a new pastime
To dwell on

Whenever I detects
Members of the other sex
I play the game I do so well, oh

I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Watchin' girls go by
My, my, my

I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Here comes one now
You might also likeHello there, female
My, my, but you do look swell
Could you please walk
A little slower

I wonder if you know
That you're putting on a show
Could you please walk
A little closer

I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Watchin' girls go by
My, my, my

I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Here comes one now
Mmm, mmm, mmmEmbed
