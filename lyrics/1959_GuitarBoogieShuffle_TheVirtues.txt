1 ContributorGuitar Boogie Shuffle LyricsDon't change yourself to suit everybody else
Don't change yourself to suit everybody else
You lay staring at your ceiling through all of the night
And out to haunt you come the ghosts of your life
You bury your head in a bone colored cradle
But do you sleep with a smile upon your face?
They say into every life a little rain must fall
But your dream cloud has burst
And dripped all over your face
A sick body forms a sick mind
But you're duty bound to do what's right
Is that the oasis of light in the darkness of your life?
You can't admit, but you can't deny
A small heart, a spiteful mind
Are you good or bad you ask yourself
And do the things you do hurt the ones who care the most for you
Are you good or bad you ask yourself
And do the things you do hurt the ones who care the most for you
Don't change yourself to suit everybody else
Don't change yourself to suit everybody else...You might also likeEmbed
