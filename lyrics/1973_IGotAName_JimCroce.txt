26 ContributorsI Got a Name Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like the pine trees lining the winding road
I've got a name, I've got a name
Like the singin' bird and the croakin' toad
I've got a name, I've got a name

[Pre-Chorus]
And I carry it with me like my daddy did
But I'm livin' the dream that he kept hid

[Chorus]
Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by

[Verse 2]
Like the north wind whistlin' down the sky
I've got a song, I've got a song
Like the whip-poor-will and the baby's cry
I've got a song, I've got a song

[Pre-Chorus]
And I carry it with me and I sing it loud
If it gets me nowhere, I'll go there proud

[Chorus]
Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by
You might also like[Bridge]
And I'm gonna go there free

[Verse 3]
Like the fool I am and I'll always be
I've got a dream, I've got a dream
They can change their minds, but they can't change me
I've got a dream, I've got a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know I could share it if you want me to
If you're goin' my way, I'll go with you

[Chorus]
Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by

[Outro]
Movin' me down the highway, rollin' me down the highway
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by10Embed
