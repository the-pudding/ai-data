1 ContributorThey Just Canâ€™t Stop It (Games People Play) LyricsCan't get no rest
Don't know how I work all day
When will I learn?
Memories get in the way

I walk around
I can't hear a sound, folks talkin' loud, but I
Don't see at all
I gotta get away, gotta get away, I don't
Know where to go
It's hopeless, so
I guess I'll leave it alone

Well, I spent all the day
Fixin' up to go somewhere
Thought I was late
And I found she wasn't there

I guess I'll find
The love, peace of mind, some other time, but I
Still have today
I gotta get away, gotta get away, I don't
Know where to go
It's hopeless, so
I guess I'll leave it alone

Night or day, they're just not matching
What they should do
Keeps me feelin' blue

Been down too long
Right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spending all day
Thinking just of you

12:45
Headed for the subway home
I took my time
'Cause I felt so all alone

Not far away
I heard a funny sound, took a look around, and I
Could see her face
Smilin' as she came, callin' out my name, so I
Know where to go
We'll take it slow
I guess I'll call it a day

Games people play
Night or day, they're just not matching
What they should do
Keeps me feeling blue
Been down too long
Right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spending all day
Thinking just of you

Not far away
I heard a funny sound, took a look around, and I
Could see her face
Smiling as she came, callin' out my name, so I
Know where to go
We'll take it slow
I guess I'll call it a day

Games people play
Night or day, they're just not matching
What they should do
Keeps me feeling blue

Been down too long
Right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spending all day
Thinking just of you

Games people play
Night or day, they're just not matching
What they should do
Keeps me feeling blue
Been down too longEmbed
