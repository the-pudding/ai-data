8 ContributorsDannyâ€™s Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun, I think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like him and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love, the sun is gonna shine above

[Chorus]
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with you, honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise, bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

[Verse 2]
Love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up, love him and he'll bring you luck
And if you find he helps your mind, better take him home
Yeah, and don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own

[Chorus]
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with you, honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise, bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

[Instrumental Bridge]

And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with you, honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise, bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right
