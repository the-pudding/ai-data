9 ContributorsStagger Lee LyricsThe night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men who were gambling in the dark
(Da, da, da, da, da, da.) It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight

Stagger Lee told Billy, "I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money and my brand new Stetson hat."
(Go, Stagger Lee.)
Stagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four
Said, "I'm going to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe."
(Go, Stagger Lee.) Go on, Stagger Lee!

(Oooh, wah.) Look out there now!
(Oooh, wah.) Come on, Stag, stop playing!
Oooh, wah, oooh, wah, oooh
Ahhh

Stagger Lee went to the barroom
And he stood across the barroom door
Said, "Now nobody move." and he pulled out his forty-four
(Da, da, da, da, da, da.)  "Stagger Lee," cried Billy
"Oh, please don't take my life
I got three little children and a very sickly wife."
(Da, da, da, da, da, da.) Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass
Look out, Stag, go!  (Go, Stagger Lee.)

(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Get out there, Stag!
(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Oh, please Stagger!
(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Come on now, Stag!
Yeah, do move that!  That...Hey!
(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Come on, Stag!Embed
