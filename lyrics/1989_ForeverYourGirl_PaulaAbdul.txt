9 ContributorsForever Your Girl Lyrics[Intro]
Hey baby
You gotta remember
I'm forever your girl
And baby, forever and ever and ever
(You know I am)

[Verse 1]
Baby, pick your head up (Head up)
Come on and look me in the face
'Cause I can tell that somethin' is bringin' you down
(Why are you down?)
Is it the rumour that another boy wants to take your place?
(I hear he's after your heart)
Have you been hearin' the stories? They're goin' around
(All of my friends are talkin')

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Baby, just remember I gave you my heart
Ain't no one gonna tear us apart
He could promise the moon and the stars above
Even if he promised me the world

[Chorus 1]
Just remember I'm forever your girl
He could promise the world
You gotta remember
I'm forever your girl
You might also like[Verse 2]
Honey, listen to me (To me)
Your love is all I need
You should know that I don't need nothin' that money can buy
(It's no lie)
So if a boy were to come along
And try to make me leave you
(Girl, I'd go out of my mind)
There'd be no need to worry
I'm tellin' you why
(I need to hear that you really love me)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, don't you know that I love ya?
And I'd never put nobody above ya
He could promise the moon and the stars above
Even if he promised me the world

[Chorus 1]
Just remember I'm forever your girl
He could promise the world
You gotta remember
I'm forever your girl

[Chorus 2]
I'm forever your baby
Just remember I'm forever your girl
He could promise the world
Hey baby, just remember
I'm forever your girl
[Bridge]
When the mountains crumble into the sea
That's the day someone'll come between you and me
Baby, just remember I gave you my heart
(Tell me) Ain't no one gonna tear us apart
Baby, he could promise me diamonds
Even if he promised me pearls
Honey, you know I ain't lyin'
Listen as I tell it to the world
Just remember, baby, remember
Just remember

[Interlude]
Baby, forever and ever and ever
We'll be together
I'm forever your girl
Baby, forever and ever and ever
We'll be together
I'm forever your girl
Baby, forever and ever and ever
We'll be together
I'm forever your girl

[Outro]
Hey baby, he could promise the world
Girl, you know I love you
And I always will (Hey baby)
If we live 'til forever
I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you still
Just remember
I'm forever your girl
Forever your girl
Just remember
I'm forever your girlEmbed
