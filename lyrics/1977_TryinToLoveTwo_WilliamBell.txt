2 ContributorsTryinâ€™ To Love Two LyricsTrying to love two
Ain't easy to do
When you're trying to love two
It sure ain't easy to do

I've got a woman at home
That's sweet as can be
A woman on the outside
Crazy about me

I'm caught in the middle
Of a three-way love affair
Caught up in this triangle
Can't go nowhere

Trying to love two
Sure ain't easy to do
When you're trying to love two
Oh, sure ain't easy to do, no

I need to be three men in one
To get my job done
I need a thirty hour day
Two jobs with double pay

I need a man to go to work
A man to stay at home
I need a man on the outside
To keep my woman strong
You might also likeTrying to love two
Sure ain't easy to do, no
When you're trying to love two
Oh, it ain't easy to do

Both women are aware
There's another woman somewhere

When you're trying to love two
Oh, it ain't easy to do
When you're trying to love two
It sure ain't easy to do

Hey, it started out, had lots of fun
But now it's got me on the run
This jumping in and out of bed
Keeps messing with my head

Trying to love two
Sure ain't easy to do, no
When you're trying to love two
Oh, it ain't easy to do

Trying to love two
Sure ain't easy to do
Oh, ain't easy to do
When you're trying to love two
It sure ain't easy...Embed
