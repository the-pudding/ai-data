You'll never know what you've done for me
What your faith in me has done for my soul
And you'll never know the gift you've given me
I'll carry it with me
Yeah, yeah
Through the days ahead, I'll think of days before (Mhm)
You made me hope for something better (Yes, you did)
And made me reach for something more

[Chorus: *NSYNC, JC Chasez]
You taught me to run, you taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Helped me hear the music of my heart
Helped me hear the music of my heart (Yeah)
You opened my eyes, you opened the door
To something I've never known before (Ooh)
And your love (Love) is the music of my heart (Music of my heart)

[Verse 2: Gloria Estefan, *NSYNC, & Chris Kirkpatrick]
You were the one always on my side (Always on my side)
Always standing by (Always standing by), seein' my through
You were the song that always made me sing (Made me sing, made me sing), I'm singing this for you (I'm singing this for you, baby)
Everywhere I go, I'll think of where I've been (Think of where I've been)
And of the one who knew me better (Better) than anyone ever will again

Helped me to free the me inside
Helped me hear the music of my heart
Helped me hear the music of my heart (Hey)
You opened my eyes, you opened the door (You opened the door)
To something I've never known before (Before)
And your love (Your love) is the music of my heart

[Bridge: Gloria Estefan, JC Chasez, & *NSYNC]
What you taught me, only your love could ever teach me
You got through where no one could reach me before (Before)
'Cause you always saw in me
All the best that I could be
It was you who set me free

[Chorus: All, Justin Timberlake,  JC Chasez, Gloria Estefan]
You taught me to run, you taught me to fly

Helped me hear the music of my heart (Music of my heart)
Helped me hear the music of my heart (Hey)

To something I've never known before (Never, never, never felt before)
And your love is the music of my heart
