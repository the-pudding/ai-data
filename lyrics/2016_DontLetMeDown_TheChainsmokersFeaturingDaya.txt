Crashin', hit a wall
Right now, I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reachin' out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around

[Chorus]
I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losin' my mind now
It's in my head, darlin', I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down

Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
