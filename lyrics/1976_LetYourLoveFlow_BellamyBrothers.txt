[Verse 1]
There's a reason for the sun-shining sky
And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when that love light shines all around us

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So, let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing through the moonlit nights with your lover

[Chorus]
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

[Verse 2]
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candlelights
Must be the season when those love rights shine all around us

And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face, you can't hold back

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

[Outro]
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams2Embed
