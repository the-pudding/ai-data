Haha, not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

[Break: Kanye West]
Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, our kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause, boy, you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes, love comes around
(Love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

I never thought I'd hear myself say (Say, mm)
"Y'all go 'head" (Oh)
"I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today"
(Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief
On my pimp ship, flyin' high (Flyin' high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile (Oh)
That shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky, uh)
Hit, so now, I'm crashin' (Don't know how it happened)
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and (Make it happen faster)
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could? (Oh)
Miss Independent (To the fullest)
The load never too much, she helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you, the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes, love...

[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Sometimes, love comes around (Aye)
(Love comes around, love comes around)
(Oh, it comes around)
And it knocks you down (Hey, hey)
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
(Ooh, when it knocks you down, oh) (Hey)
Sometimes, love comes around (Ooh-ooh, yeah, comes around)
And it knocks you down (Oh, whoa)
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
(When it knocks you down, knocks you down)
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA?
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seemed to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So, please, don't mess up the trick
"Hey Young World," I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice?
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flyin'; now, I'm crashing
This is bad, real bad—Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad—Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask him
[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
Well, will you bring a better future than I had in the past?
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa) Mmh-mmh, I'll admit it
I was scared to answer love's call
(Whoa, whoa) And if it hits better make it worth the fall
When it comes around, hey
[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo, Both]
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around, love comes around)
Comes around, whoa
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
(Get back up when it knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around (When love comes around)
(When love comes around)
And it knocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)
Just get back up when it knocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)
Knocks you down
(When it knocks you down, knocks you down)

[Outro: Keri Hilson & Ne-Yo, Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Won't see it coming when it happens (Eh)
But when it happens (Uh-huh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Oh, no, when it knocks you down
Won't see it coming when it happens (Oh-oh)
But when it happens (Ooh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now (Tell you now)
You see, when love comes and knocks you down
