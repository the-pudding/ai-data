I don't wanna lose you, this good thing
That I've got
'Cause if I do, I will surely
Surely lose a lot
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightnin'
The way you love me is frightenin'
You better knock, knock

[Chorus]
On wood, baby
Ooh
Baby
Ooh
Woo

[Verse 2]
I'm not superstitious about ya
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnin', baby
You know that I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightnin'
The way you love me is frightenin'
You better knock, knock, knock
