3 ContributorsWhen We Get Married LyricsDarling..oh oh
When we get married
We will have a big celebration
Send invitations to all of our friends and relations
We'll have a ball, dancing and all
When we get married

With the bells ringing
And tell the world that I'm taking your hand
Folks from all over
Will come to see the wedding we planned
We'll have a ball, dancing and all
When we get married (when we get married)

We'll have a time(we'll have a time)
And darling we will be us again
We'll have a ball, dancing and all
And darling we will be as one

Just wait and see, our wedding day is not very far
Our folks will whisper, and say how lovely we both are
We'll have a ball , dancing and all
