Wherever you go
Wherever you may wander in your life
Surely you know
I'll always wanna be there
Holding your hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through
In everything you do

[Chorus]
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right (Make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
(Oh, let me be there)

[Verse 2]
Watching you grow
And going through the changes in your life
That's how I know
I'll always wanna be there
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on, here I am
Whenever you call, you know I'll be there
You might also like[Chorus]
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right (Make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
(Oh, let me be there)
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right (Make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
(Let me be there)
All I ask you is let me be there
(Let me be there)1Embed
