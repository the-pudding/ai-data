2 ContributorsTell Me Why Lyrics[Intro: All]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: Gioia]
Echoes thunder almost every night
Why this prison if we're all alike?
Look around you, look at all your friends
Tell me, are they just what they pretend?

[Pre-Chorus: Gioia with All]
Listen to my story if you have the time
Yes, we'll make the difference if we really try
Listen everybody and start to make it right
One and all together, we feel it from inside

[Chorus: All]
Tell me why it echoes every night
Why we fight just to find who's wrong or right
Don't let it slide, you can't run and hide
Tell me why, oh, won't you please tell me why?

[Post-Chorus: All]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)

Give me a reason for all this senseless crime
We can change it, why'd they have to die?
Think of the children, tomorrow's their future
Don't make them feel it's just another day

[Pre-Chorus: Gioia with All]
Tell me anybody, why can't we live together?
End all the fighting, erase it all forever
Listen for this reason before it gets too late
Soon, there will be no one, no one left to hate

[Chorus: All]
Tell me why it echoes every night
Why we fight just to find who's wrong or right
Don't let it slide, you can't run and hide
Tell me why, oh, won't you please tell me why?

[Bridge: Gioia with All, All]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Won't you tell me, tell me why?
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Tell me why we fight (tell me, tell me why)
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Tell me, tell me why
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Won't you tell me why we fight? (tell me, tell me why)
[Pre-Chorus: Gioia with All]
So, tell me anybody, why can't we live together?
End all the fighting, erase it all forever
Listen for this reason before it gets too late
Soon, there will be no one, no one left to hate (so tell me)

[Chorus: All]
Tell me why it echoes every night
Why we fight just to find who's wrong or right
Don't let it slide, you can't run and hide
Tell me why, oh, won't you please tell me why?

Tell me why it echoes every night
Why we fight just to find who's wrong or right
Don't let it slide, you can't run and hide
Tell me why, oh, won't you please tell me why?

[Outro: Gioia, All]
Games are not where it's at
Give it up, no time for that
Imagine people hand in hand
No more fighting in this land
Red, yellow, black or white (oh, oh-oh-oh)
Colors don't make up what's right
Come with me and see the light
We can start the peace tonight
Let the music fill your life (oh, oh-oh-oh)
Now's the time to realize
Don't be living in a lie (oh, oh-oh-oh)
Can't you hear the people's cry? (oh, oh-oh-oh)
Can't you hear the people's cry? (tell me, tell me why)Embed
