Uh, let me see you go back (Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H)
Let me see you come forth, yeah

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
It's Friday and I'm ready to swing
Pick up my girls and hit the party scene
Tonight, oh, it's alright, mmm
So get up and let this funky mellow groove
Get you in the mood
'Cause you know it's alright

[Pre-Chorus: Aaliyah]
So Mr. DJ, keep the music grooving (Keep on grooving)
Don't stop moving (Don't stop moving)
Let me see you, let me see you go

See, can you feel the groove moving when I'm with you?
Hey, I wanna keep this party going on all night
