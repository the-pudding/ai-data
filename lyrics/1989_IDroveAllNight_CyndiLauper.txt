I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, I

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

[Chorus]
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night

[Verse 2]
What in this world
Keeps us from tearing apart?
No matter where I go I hear
The beating of your heart
I think about you
When the night is cold and da-ah-ark

No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases the feeling between me and you

[Chorus]
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

[Chorus]
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
I drove all night
[Outro]
Taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside
I drove all night...Embed
