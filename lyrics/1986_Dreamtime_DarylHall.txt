4 ContributorsDreamtime Lyrics[Intro]
Uh!

[Verse 1]
I saw you standing and I felt your rage
Like a dark cloud
On a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke
In your fantasy
I know you, girl!
I know what to believe
Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love
Never cared at all
You wanna run away
Don't care where you go
You wanna run away
Run away
That's all you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe it's alright
To fantasize
Say the words
You think will satisfy me
But you know
Better than that
'Cuz you know
What's a lie

You're living in dreamtime, baby!
You wanna run away
It's time to wake up!
Oh!
You're living on dreamtime, baby!
You wanna run away
It's time to shape up!

[Verse 2]
In your dream
It's overcast
Rain comes down
Moving your way fast
You wanna run away
Don't care where you go
You wanna run away
Run away
That's all you know
You turn a corner
And you see a door
Walk on through
Throw yourself on the floor
Oh! When you're looking up
It's no surprise
Standing there is a man
With movie star eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
You think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan
That will see you through
And I say
There ain't no way
'Cuz I know
He's a lie

[Chorus]
You're living in dreamtime, baby!
You wanna run away
It's time to wake up!
Oh!
You're living on dreamtime, baby!
You wanna run away
It's time to shape up!
Shape up!
You're living on dreamtime
You wanna run away
Whoa-whoa
You're living on dreamtime, baby!
You wanna run away
Wanna run away
Wanna run away
[Bridge]
I know
I say

[Chorus]
You're living in dreamtime, baby!
You wanna run away
Shape up!
You're living on dreamtime, baby!
You wanna run away
It's time to wake up!
I never saw anybody fall apart so fast
You're living in dreamtime
You know it ain't gonna last
Never saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong
Living in dreamtime
It's hard to carry on, girl!Embed
