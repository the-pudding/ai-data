23 ContributorsRidinâ€™ Solo Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine
I'm loving cloud nine, my head's in the sky
I'm solo, I'm riding solo
I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, solo

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight
Finally doing me and it feels so right, oh
Time to do the things I like
Going to the club, everything's alright, oh
No one to answer to
No one that's gon' argue, no
And since I got the hold off me
I'm living life now that I'm free, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me get my shit together
Now I got my shit together, yeah, yeah
Now I made it through the weather
Better days are gon' get better
