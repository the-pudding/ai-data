8 ContributorsI Believe Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
Have you ever reached a rainbow's end
And did you find your pot of gold? Oh
Ever catch a shooting star?
And tell me, how high did you soar?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever felt like you were dreaming
Just to find that you're awake?
And the magic that surrounds you
Can lift you up and guide you on your way

[Chorus]
I can see it in the stars across the sky
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see, I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally, I believe

[Verse 2]
When you look out in the distance
You see, it never was that far, oh no
Heaven knows your existence
And leads you to be everything you are, oh

There's a time for every soul to fly
It's in the eyes of every child
It's the hope, the love that saves the world
And, oh, we should never let it go

[Chorus]
I can see it in the stars across the sky (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see, I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I believe in the impossible
If I reach deep within my heart, yeah
Overcome any obstacle
Won't let this dream just fall apart
You see, I strive to be the very best
Shine my light for all to see
'Cause anything is possible
Oh, when you believe, yeah

[Chorus]
I can see it in the stars across the sky (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see, I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally
I believe
Oh-oh, yeah

I believe, oh yeah, yeah
Love keeps lifting me higher (I believe in love)
Love keeps lifting me higher (Higher, higher, higher, higher)
