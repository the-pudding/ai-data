12 ContributorsRoll to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look around your world pretty baby
Is it everything you hoped it'd be
The wrong guy, the wrong situation

[Pre-Chorus]
The right time to roll to me
Roll to me

[Verse 2]
Look into your heart pretty baby
Is it aching with some nameless need
Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it

[Pre-Chorus]
Right then, roll to me

[Chorus]
And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?

[Verse 3]
So don't try to deny it pretty baby
You've been down so long you can hardly see
When the engine's stalled and it won't stop raining
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's the right time to roll to me
Roll to me, Roll to me

[Chorus]
And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?

[Verse 1 (Repeated)]
So look around your world pretty baby
Is it everything you hoped it'd be
The wrong guy, the wrong situation

[Outro]
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me
