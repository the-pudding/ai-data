14 ContributorsLove You Inside Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, I can't figure it out, your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't give me no rise
Oh, oh, what you tryna do?
Livin' on your cheatin' and the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever, but you're driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you when your world ain't working right

[Chorus]
I ain't no vision, I am the man who
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

[Verse 2]
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
Figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever, we won't ever feel the storm
You might also like[Chorus]
I ain't no vision, I am the man who
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

[Bridge]
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word, I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

[Verse 3]
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle, I will burn again tomorrow
No man on Earth can stand between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me, I will love you 'til I die

[Chorus]
I ain't no vision, I am the man who
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I (I), love (Love), no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I (I), love (Love), no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love (Love), no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?1Embed
