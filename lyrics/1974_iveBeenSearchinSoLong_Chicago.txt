8 Contributors(I’ve Been) Searchin’ So Long Lyrics[Verse 1: Peter Cetera, with bandmates]
As my life goes on, I believe
Somehow something's changed
Something deep inside
Ooh, a part of me
There's a strange new light in my eyes
Things I've never known
Changing my life
Changing me

[Chorus: Peter Cetera, with bandmates]
I've been searching
So long
To find an answer
Now I know my life has meaning, oh

[Verse 2: Peter Cetera, with bandmates]
Now I see myself as I am
Feeling very free
Life is everything
Ooh, it's meant to be
When my tears have come to an end
I will understand
What I left behind
Part of me
