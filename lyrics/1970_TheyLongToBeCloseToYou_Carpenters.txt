29 Contributors(They Long to Be) Close to You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

[Verse 2]
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

[Bridge]
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

[Verse 3]
That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (All around)
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

[Bridge]
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (All around)
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me (Just like me), they long to be
Close to you

[Outro]
Wha, close to you
Wha, close to you
Ha, close to you
Wha, close to you
Wha, close to you
Wha, close to you
