8 ContributorsYou Beat Me to the Punch Lyrics[Verse 1]
That day, I first saw you, oh, oh, passing by
I wanted to know your name but I was much too shy
But I was looking at you (Looking) so hard
Until you must have had a hunch (You must have had a hunch)
So you came up to me and asked me my name

[Chorus]
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch), that time
You beat me to the punch, oh-oh-oh-oh (You beat me to the punch)
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch)

[Verse 2]
Oh-oh-oh, after I had known you for what seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you, would you please, please be mine?
Whenever you came around (You came), my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch (You must have had a hunch)
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours

[Chorus]
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch), one more time
You beat me to the punch, oh-oh-oh-oh (You beat me to the punch)
You beat me to the punch, yeah (You beat me to the punch)

[Bridge]
Since I love you, I thought you would be true and love me tender
So I let my heart surrender - to you, yes, I did
But I found out beyond a doubt one day, boy, you were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me blue

So I ain't gonna wait around (Gonna wait) for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch (I'm gonna play my hunch)
And walk away this very day

[Chorus]
And beat you to the punch (And beat you to the punch) this time
I'll beat you to the punch (I'll beat you to the punch), yes, I will
Let you know, know, how it feels (I'll beat you to the punch)
Oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (I'll beat you to the punch)
Oh oh oh ohEmbed
