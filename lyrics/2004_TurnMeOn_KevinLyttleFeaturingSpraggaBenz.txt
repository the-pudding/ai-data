2 ContributorsTurn Me On (remix) LyricsOh yeaah… Ah ah ah…
Is ah big dancehall song in know
Madzart alongside Kevin Lyttle
You know how it is, you know how we go
You know

For the longest while we jamming in the party
And you're wining on me
Pushing everything
Right back on top of me (yea - hey- ai)
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind
You're going home…
You're going home with me tonight

So let me hold you
Girl caress my body
You got me going crazy - you
-Turn me on
-Turn me on…
Let me jam you
Girl wine all around me
You got me going crazy - you
-Turn me on
-Turn me on…

Push it harder back on me
