I've got a song
I ain't got no melody
I'ma gonna sing it to my friends
I've got a song
I ain't got no melody
I' ma gonna sing it to my friends

[Chorus]
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky

[Verse 2]
I've got a story
Ain't got no moral
Let the bad guy win every once in a while
I've got a story
Ain't got no moral
Let the bad guy win every once in a while

[Chorus]
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky

I've got a dance
I ain't got no steps, no
I'm gonna let the music move me around
I've got a dance
I ain't got no steps
I'm gonna let the music move me around

[Chorus]
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky

[Verse 1 Repeated]
I've got a song
I ain't got no melody

I've got a song
I ain't got no melody
I' ma gonna sing it to my friends
[Chorus]
Will it go round in circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
