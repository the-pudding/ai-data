When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
(You know it's hard, you know it gets so hard)

[Chorus 1]
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

[Verse 2]
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)

[Chorus 2]
You know that its crazy and you don't wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

[Post-Chorus]
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone

[Bridge]
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is I've been fooled before
By fair-weathered friends and faint-hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
(Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies
(Keep lookin' for lies, baby keep lookin' for eyes)

[Chorus 3]
Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

[Post-Chorus]
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone

[Verse 2]
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends-you better lookout)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, oh it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)

[Verse 3]
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
(Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies
(Keep lookin' for lies, baby keep lookin' for eyes)Embed
