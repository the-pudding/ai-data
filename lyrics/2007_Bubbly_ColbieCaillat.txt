Will you count me in?

[Verse 1]
I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feeling like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

[Chorus]
It starts in my toes and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

[Verse 2]
The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under covers, stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

[Chorus]
They start in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

When you make me feel this way?
I just... mm

[Chorus]
And it starts in my toes, makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

Ta-da-dam, ta-da, da-dam, ta-da-dam, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-dam
Um-ba, da-da, um-ba, ta-da-da-da, uhm, mm-mmh

[Verse 3]
I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in, just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

[Chorus]
It starts in my soul and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows
'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now
Holding me tight
[Outro]
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever you go, I always know
'Cause you make me smile, even just for a while31Embed
