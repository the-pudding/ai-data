5 ContributorsBristol Stomp LyricsThe kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp
Really somethin' when they join is jumpin'
When they do the Bristol Stomp

Whoa, they start spinning every Friday night
They dance the greatest and they do it right
Well, it's the latest, it's the greatest sight to see

The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol (Whoa, oh, oh)
When they do the Bristol Stomp (Whoa, oh, oh)
Really somethin' when they join is jumpin'
(Ah-ah-ah, whoa)
When they do the Bristol Stomp

Whoa, it started in Bristol at a dee jay hop
They hollered and whistled, never want to stop
We pony and twisted and we rocked with Daddy G

The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp
(Whoa, oh, oh)
Really somethin' when they join is jumpin'
(Ah-ah-ah)
When they do the Bristol Stomp
(Duh-duh-doo)
You might also likeIt's got that groovy beat
That makes you stomp your feet
Come along and try
Gonna feel fine
And once you dance with me
You'll fall in love you see
The Bristol Stomp will make you mine, all mine

The stars are spinning every Friday night
They dance the greatest if they do it right
But it's the latest, it's the greatest sight to see

The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp
(Whoa, oh, oh)
Really somethin' when they join is jumpin'
When they do the Bristol Stomp

It started in Bristol at a dee jay hop
They hollered and whistled, never want to stop
We pony and twisted and we rocked with Daddy G

The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp
(Whoa)
Really somethin' when they join is jumpin'
When they do the Bristol Stomp
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol StompEmbed
