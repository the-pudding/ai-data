Like quicksand, quicksand
Pulling me closer, closer in your arms
Can't resist your loving charms
You're like quicksand
Sinking me deeper in love with you

[Verse 1]
The more I fight it, the deeper in love I get
Each time you hold me
I feel nothing but happiness
It's not safe loving you this way
But from your arms I can't stay

[Chorus]
You're like quicksand, quicksand, yeah
Pulling me closer, closer
Making me love you, need you
(Deeper) Sinking me deeper, deeper in love with you

[Bridge]
Deeper, deeper, deeper
In love with you

[Verse 2]
My heart is a prisoner of your warm embrace
I can't help, I can't help myself
Nothing can take your place
When you say sweet things to me
I start trembling from head to feet
You might also like[Chorus]
You're like quicksand, quicksand, yeah
Pulling me closer, closer
(Quicksand, quicksand) I just can't resist you
(Quicksand, quicksand) I just want to kiss you
(Quicksand, quicksand) You're like quicksand, yeah

Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand, baby, pulling me closer, yeah
Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand pulling me closer
(It's taking me deeper, it's taking me deeper)
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper in love with you
(I just can't resist you, I just want to kiss you)

Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper in love with you
Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand pulling me closerEmbed
