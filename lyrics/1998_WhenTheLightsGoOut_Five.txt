1 ContributorWhen the Lights Go Out LyricsLook away look away - got to close my eyes
Well I've got to admit - that it's been a long time
Since I took a look - to see what's inside
Look away look away - got to close my eyes

I don't want to see what I already know
I KNOW
Behind these eyes there's a truth in a shadow
I just can't hide
Something inside - burning to get out
Waiting to be released - when the lights go out

Look away look away - got to close my eyes
Well I've got to admit - that it's been a long time
Since I took a look - to see what's inside
Look away look away - got to close my eyes

I don't want to see what I already know
I KNOW
Behind these eyes there's a truth in a shadow
I just can't hide
Something inside - burning to get out
Waiting to be released
WHEN – THE – LIGHTS – GO – OUT
OUT
