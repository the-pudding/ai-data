6 ContributorsGet Over Yourself Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get over, get over (listen)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was right there like a little wife
I was everything that you need, always in line
I was livin' you, lovin' you
Fillin' your desires
But that was then, this is now
Look me in the eye and

Oh, oh
If love could choose sides
Oh, oh
It's taking mine, so

[Chorus]
Get over yourself, goodbye
It must be hard to be you, yeah
Livin' in your life
I was always the one to cry
Now everything, everything
Everything is alright
You might also likeGet over yourself, know why
'Cause without you
See, I do anything I like
Sometimes I stay out all night
And everything, everything
Everything is alright

[Verse 2]
This just can't be it
I kept telling myself
And every magazine said
Was me was on the shelf

I was givin' out
Givin' in
Givin' away my dreams (that's right)
You put it in
Put me down
Now I found my self-esteem

Oh, oh
Won't get me back, no
Oh, oh (no no)
You overreact (you're overreacting), yeah

[Chorus]
Get over yourself, goodbye
It must be hard to be you, yeah
Livin' in your life
I was always the one to cry
Now everything, everything
Everything is alright
Get over yourself, know why
'Cause without you
See, I do anything I like
Sometimes I stay out all night
And everything, everything
Everything is alright

[Bridge]
So now you wanna talk
Say, let's do it just once more for luck
Like old times, make up
Better yet, just forget
Better get over yourself

Stay in touch
When you learn a few things about love (tell me, baby)
Until then, wake up
Better yet, better get
Better get over yourself

[Breakdown]
Get over yourself, goodbye
(Over yourself, goodbye)
Over yourself, over yourself

Get over yourself, goodbye
(Always the one to cry, baby)
(Over yourself, goodbye)
Over yourself, over yourself
(Every single night)
Get over yourself, know why
'Cause without you
See, I do anything I like
(I do anything I want, baby)
Sometimes I stay out all night
And everything, everything
Everything is alright

[Chorus]

Get over yourself, goodbye
It must be hard to be you, yeah
Livin' in your life
I was always the one to cry
Now everything, everything
Everything is alright
(Get over yourself, baby)

Get over yourself, know why
'Cause without you
See, I do anything I like
(I do anything I want, baby)
Sometimes I stay out all night (yeah, baby)
And everything, everything
Everything is alright

Get over yourself, goodbye
(Get over yourself, baby)
It must be hard to be you, yeah
Livin' in your life
I was always the one to cry
(Yes I was, now)
Now everything, everything
Everything is alright

Get over yourself, know why
'Cause without you
See, I do anything I like
(Anything I want, anything I want)
Sometimes I stay out all night
And everything, everything
Everything is alright
(Anything I want)

(Everything is alright)
Over yourself
(Everything is alright)
Get over yourself, goodbye
(Everything is alright)
Over yourself
Get over yourself, goodbye1Embed
