8 ContributorsBefore I Let You Go Lyrics[Intro]
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss, goodnight, baby
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss, goodnight, baby
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss, goodnight, baby
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss, goodnight, baby

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been thinking something's going wrong
Cause you got an attitude
And you're not in the mood, like you used to
Girl I can feel it when I hold you in my arms
The feeling is not the same
Can I be the one to blame?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna say bye-bye
True love is so hard to find
And it's right between your lips and mine
And mine (Before I let go)

[Chorus]
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?

Listen baby, turn the lights down low, let's take it nice and slow
My mission is to keep you mine
Don't want this to be the last time
We make sweet love baby; I know you feel it, too
It's bigger than the both of us
There's one thing I'm so certain of

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose your love (Don't wanna lose ya)
I don't wanna say bye bye (Don't wanna lose ya)
It's always the little things
I remember and I can't just let it slip away
Slip away (before)

[Chorus]
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?

[Interlude]
Teddy, won't you play the music for me
Teddy, won't you play
Blackstreet say
[Bridge 1]
(Don't wanna lose ya)
Baby I get so lonely sometimes, I
(Don't wanna lose ya)
Baby my heart is broken sometimes
I need you right now, I don't
Don't wanna loose ya
I can't let you slip away, slip away
Before I let go

[Chorus]
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?

[Bridge 2]
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?
[Outro]
I don't want lose your sweet love
So don't say goodbye, say goodnight1Embed
