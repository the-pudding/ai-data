4 ContributorsIt’s a Man’s, Man’s, Man’s World (Live at the Apollo Theater, 1967) LyricsThis is a man's world
This is a man’s world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl
I'll say it one more time
This is a man's world
This is a man’s world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl
Now, looka here

You see, man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electro-light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made The Ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl
Looka here

Man thinks about a little bit of baby girls, and of baby boys
Man make them happy
Because man make them toys
But after man make everything
Everything he can
Do you know that man makes money
To buy from other man?
You might also likeThis is a man's, man's, man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl
Looka here

But oh, how a man needs a woman
A man needs a woman
Lord, he got to have a woman now
Man, man can make everything he can
But a woman makes a better man
So baby, don't worry
Don’t worry
Don’t worry about the peeling falling from the ceiling
But just be there when I get the feeling
UH! UH! UH! UH!
Baby, don't worry
Don’t worry about the motion of the ocean
But just be there when I take a notion
UH! UH! Do you know what I'm talking about?
UH! Say it one more time, UH!
The man, the man that don't have a woman
The man, the man that don't have a woman
He lost...in the wilderness
The man, the man that don’t have a woman
He's lost...in bitterness
The man, thank you, the man that don't have a woman
The man, the man that don't have a woman
He's lost...in loneliness
Let's give a big round of applause for the violin section
Will you please stand up, take a bow
Thank you very muchEmbed
