23 ContributorsLose My Breath Lyrics[Intro: Michelle Williams]
Hit me!

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my "ha, ha"
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath, ha, ha

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Ooh, I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like ya don't know what to do
After I had done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Move so fast, baby, now I can't find you
Ooh, I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk, but it seems like you can't come through
All them nights like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believin' you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my "ha, ha"
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath, ha, ha

Ooh, two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partner that meets me only halfway and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Do you understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you?
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference from a man and an adolescent
It ain't you, boo, so get to steppin'

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland & Both]
Can you keep up? (Ooh)
Baby boy, make me lose my breath (My breath)
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my "ha, ha" (Ha, ha)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath, ha, ha
Can you keep up? (Ooh)
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath (My breath)
Hit me hard, make me lose my "ha, ha" (Ha, ha)
Can you keep up? (Yeah)
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath, ha, ha (Ooh)
[Bridge: Michelle Williams, Beyoncé & Both]
If you can't make me say, "Ooh"
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some?
You ain't really want none
If you can't make me say "Ooh" (Ooh, ooh)
Like the beat of this groove
You don't have no business in this
Here's your papers, baby, you are dismissed (Woo)

[Break: Darkchild]
Come on
Breathe with me
Ha, ha
Darkchild
Come on, let's go

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my "ha, ha"
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath, ha, ha
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my "ha, ha"
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath, ha, ha12Embed
