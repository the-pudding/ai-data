Early in the morning, I put breakfast at your table
And make sure that your coffee has its sugar and cream
Your eggs are over-easy, your toast done lightly
All that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me
Now you say the juice is sour, it used to be so sweet
And I can't help but to wonder if you're talking 'bout me
We don't talk the way we used to talk, it’s hurting so deep
I’ve got my pride, I will not cry
But it’s making me weak

[Chorus]
I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me
(Ooh baby, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you
But when you get there you just tell me you’re not hungry at all
You said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk
You like to think that I’m just crazy when I say that you've changed
I’m convinced I know the problem: you don't love me the same
You’re just going through the motions and you’re not being fair
I've got my pride, I will not cry
Still I can't help but care
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm not your superwoman (Oh no no no)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything is okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me
I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay (Don't let me down, don't let me down)
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human, yeah)
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me

[Bridge]
Ooh baby
Look into the corners of your mind
I'll always be there for you through good and bad times
But I can't be that superwoman that you want me to be
I'll give my love, everlasting love if you'll return love to me
I’m not your superwoman

[Chorus]
I'm not your superwoman (Oh no, oh no)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me

[Bridge]
Ah-ha, if you feel it in your heart and you understand me
Stop right where you are, everybody sing along with me
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo…hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
I’m the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet
But you got to realize that you got to be sweeter to me, oh
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo…hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
I need love
I need just your love
I'm not your superwoman
[Chorus]
I'm not your superwoman (Oh no)
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me
I'm not your superwoman1Embed
