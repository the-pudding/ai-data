My, my
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

[Pre-Chorus]
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Verse 2]
My, my
I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Pre-Chorus]
So how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

[Outro]
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you16Embed
