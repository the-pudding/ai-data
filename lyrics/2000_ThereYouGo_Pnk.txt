17 ContributorsThere You Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Please don't come around talkin' 'bout that you love me
'Cause that love shit just ain't for me
And I don't wanna hear that you adore me
And I know that all you're doing is playin' your mind games
Don't you know that game beats these games?
So your best bet is to be straight with me

[Pre-Chorus]
So you say you wanna talk, let's talk
If you won't talk, I'll walk
Yeah, it's like that
I got a new man, he's waiting out back
Now what, whatcha think about that?
Now when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically, I'm through with you
Whatcha wanna say, had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay

[Chorus]
There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go
There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go

Please don't come around talking about how you changed
How you said good-bye to what's her name
All it sounds like to me is new game
And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off without you
Had to get myself from 'round you, because my life was all about you

[Pre-Chorus]
So you say you wanna talk, I don't
Say you wanna change, I won't
Yeah, it's like that
Had your chance, won't take you back
Now what, what you think about that?
And when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
What you wanna say?
Had to have it your way, had to play games, now you're begging me to stay

[Chorus]
There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go
There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go
[Bridge]
Oh, don't you wish you could turn the hands of time
Don't you wish you still were mine?
Don't you wish I'd take you back?
Don't you wish that things were simple like that, oh?
Didn't miss a good thing 'til it's gone
But I knew it wouldn't be long, till you came running back
Missing my love, there you go

[Chorus]
There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go
There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go
There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go
There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go
There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go
There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go
[Outro]
So there you go, there you go3Embed
