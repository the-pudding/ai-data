I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful (Somethin' beautiful)
Somethin' beautiful (Somethin' beautiful)
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle (Oh)
On a miracle (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Don't fall asleep (Ooh)
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need (Oh)
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
(Yeah) Know we're good enough

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
