10 ContributorsCome With Me LyricsUh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah, uh
Uh-huh, yeah, uh
Uh-huh, yeah, uh
Uh-huh, yeah, uh
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

Hear my cries, hear my call
Lend me your ears, see my fall
See my error, know my faults
Time halts, see my loss
Know I'm lacking, backtracking
Where I met you, pistol packing
Itchy finger, trigger happy
Try to trap me, bad rap
Wiretap me, backstab me
Break the faith, fall from grace
Tell me lies, time flies
Close your eyes, come with me

Come with me, yeah
Come with me

Uh-huh, yeah

You said to trust you, you'd never hurt me
Now I'm disgusted, since then adjusted
Certainly you fooled me, ridiculed me
Left me hanging, now shitâ€™s boomeranging
Right back at you, think long range
Narrow-minded, left me blinded
I cosigned it, shit backfired
But I'm bouncing back, I grinded
Not many would bear the pressure, you comprehend me?
You want to end me, you offend me
It's drama, feel the trauma
Come with me

Come with me
Don't be afraid, yeah
Come with me

[Bridge]
I close my eyes and I see you standing there
I cry tears of sorrow, I die

Uh-huh, yeah

Fuck my enemies, fuck my foes
Damn these hoes, you're stepping on my toes
Back up off me, take your hands off me
Give me room to breathe
I'm not hearing it, I'm not fearing it
I'm up to my ears in it, bullshit
I'm destructive, some women find that seductive
Some say it's lunacy, reluctantly I've been moving on
I ignore you, sorry if I bore you
I neglect you, don't mean to disrespect you
Can't you see...
I love you dearly? And that sincerely
But you annoy me, you can't avoid me
I'm here to stay, forever and ever and a day, that's never
I can't let you go, I can't forget it
Why you did it, I won't permit it
And won't acquit it, I want to fight you
I'll fucking bite you, can't stand nobody like you
You can't run, you can't hide
No surprise, close your eyes
Come with me
Yeah, come with me

Hear my cries, hear my calls
Lend me your ears, uhh
I wanna get it just right, I wanna get it just right

Hear my cries, hear my calls
Lend me your ears, see my fall
See my errors, know my faults
Time halts, see my loss
Know I'm lacking, backtracking
Where I met you, pistol packing
Itchy finger, trigger happy
Try to trap me, bad rap
Wiretap me, backstab me
Break the faith, fall from grace
Tell me lies, time flies
Close your eyes
