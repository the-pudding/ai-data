Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

[Chorus]
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see

[Verse 2]
Another day goes by
And still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
You want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

[Chorus]
And the world (And the world) will be a better place
All the world (And the world) will be a better place
For you (For you) and me (and me)
You just wait (Just wait) and see, wait and see
You might also like[Verse 3]
Take a good look around
And if you're looking down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide
Kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart

[Chorus]
And the world (And the world) will be a better place
And the world (And the world) will be a better place
For you (For you) and me (and me)
You just wait (Just wait) and see

[Outro]
People now
Put a little love in your heart
Each and every day
Put a little love in your heart
There's no other way
Put a little love in your heart
It's up to you
Put a little love in your heart
C'mon and
Put a little love in your heart
You've got to put a little love in your heart2Embed
