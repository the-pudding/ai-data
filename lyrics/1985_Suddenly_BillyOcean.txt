6 ContributorsSuddenly Lyrics[Verse 1]
I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing
Cause this love is everlasting

[Chorus]
Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough
To say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for

[Chorus]
Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love
You might also like[Bridge]
Each day
I pray, this love affair would last forever
Oh hoh

[Chorus]
Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, suddenly you're in love

[Outro]
Ooh
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, suddenly you're in love
Ooh...2Embed
