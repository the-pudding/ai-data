And I had to start again with just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars to be living here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

[Chorus]
And I'm proud to be an american
Were at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the ones who died and gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the USA
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
Detroit down to Houston
And New York the L.A
Where there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say...

[Chorus x2]You might also likeEmbed
