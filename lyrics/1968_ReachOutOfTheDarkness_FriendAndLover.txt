5 ContributorsReach Out of the Darkness Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's so groovy, now
That people are finally gettin' together
I think it's wonderful an' how
That people are finally gettin' together
I think it's so groovy, now
That people are finally gettin' together
I think it's wonderful an' how
That people are finally gettin' together

[Chorus]
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
And you may find a friend

[Verse 1]
I knew a man that I did not care for
And then one day this man gave me a call
We sat and talked about things on our mind
And now this man, he is a friend of mine

[Chorus]
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
And you may find a friend
You might also like[Post-Chorus]

I think it's wonderful an' how
That people are finally gettin' together

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid of love, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid to love
Listen to me, everybody needs a little love
Everybody needs somebody that they can be thinking of
Now, reach out!

[Chorus]
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
And you may find a friend
