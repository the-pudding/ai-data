8 ContributorsCrying Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was all right for a while
I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say 'hello'
And though you wished me well
You couldn't tell

[Chorus]
That I'd been crying, over you
Crying, over you
Then you said so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
Crying
Crying
Crying

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

[Verse 2]
I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before
But, darling, what can I do

While you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying, over you
Crying, over you

[Post-Chorus]
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying (Crying)
Crying (Crying)
Crying (Crying)
Crying

[Outro]
I'm crying
Crying
Over youEmbed
