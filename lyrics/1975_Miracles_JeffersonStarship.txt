9 ContributorsMiracles LyricsIf only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I
If only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)

I might have to move heaven and earth
To prove it to you, baby (Baby)
So we're making love
And you feel the power
And I feel the power
Then there's really nothing we can't do
(You know we could, you know we could)
If we wanted to, baby
(You know we could, you know we could)
We could exist on the stars
It'd be so easy

Now, baby
All we gotta do (Baby, baby, baby, oh, baby)
Is get a little faith in you (Baby, baby)
Oh, I've been so many places
I've seen some things (Yes, I have)
I know love is the answer (Yes, it is)
Keeps holding this world together, yeah
Ain't nothing better
Ain't nothing better (Nothing's better)
And all the answers to our prayers
Hell, it's the same everywheres, baby (Just the same now)
Nothing ever breaks up the heart (Love's a game now)
Only tears give you away (Ain't it a shame now?)
