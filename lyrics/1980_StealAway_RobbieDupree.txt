11 ContributorsSteal Away Lyrics[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Come on and hold me
Just like you told me
Then show me
What I want to know

[Chorus 1]
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night
I know it ain't right

[Verse 2]
Don't tease me
Why don't you please me
And show me
What you came here for

[Chorus 1]
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night
I know it ain't right

Baby, tonight
Ooh

I caught you glancing my way
And I know what you're after
No second chances tonight

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away

[Hook]
Into the night
I know it ain't right
Into the night
I know it ain't right

[Chorus 2]
Why don't we steal away
I know it ain't right
Into the night, babe
Why don't we steal away
Make it tonight
Why don't we steal away2Embed
