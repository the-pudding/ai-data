14 Contributors(Keep Feeling) Fascination Lyrics[Verse 1]
If it seems a little time is needed
Decisions to be made
The good advice of friends unheeded
The best of plans mislaid

Just looking for a new direction
In an old familiar way
The forming of a new connection
To study or to play

[Pre-Chorus]
And so the conversation turned
Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

[Chorus]
Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on

[Verse 2]
Well, the truth may need some rearranging
Stories to be told
And plain to see the facts are changing
No meaning left to hold

And many fantasies were learned
On that day

[Chorus]
Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on

[Pre-Chorus]
And so the conversation turned
Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

[Chorus]
Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on
Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination

Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
