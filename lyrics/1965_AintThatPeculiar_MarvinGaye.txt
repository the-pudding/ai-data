Honey, you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get, you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before

[Pre-Chorus]
I know flowers go from rain
But how can love grow from pain (Pain, pain, pain, pain)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar (Ain't that peculiar)
A peculiar-ality (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar)

[Verse 2]
Oh, you tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you baby, 'til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true

[Pre-Chorus]
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger (Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
You might also like[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity, hey, hey (Ain't that peculiar)

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Hey hey (Hey hey)
Ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Hey hey (Hey hey)
Ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah)
Ooh

[Verse 3]
I cried so much just like a child that's lost a toy
Maybe baby, you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child, my tears don't help me to get my way

[Pre-Chorus]
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears? (Tears, tears, tears, tears)

[Chorus]
Now ain't that peculiar baby? (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar-arity (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't it peculiar, honey? (Ain't that peculiar)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar)
Said I don't understand it, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
It's so strange sometimes (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't it peculiar, darling? (Ain't that peculiar)
Oh, baby (Ain't that peculiar)
Talk about strange (Ain't that peculiar)
Ain't it funny? (Ain't that peculiar)2Embed
