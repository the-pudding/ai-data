4 ContributorsCrying Dude Raps About Dead Mother LyricsThere's not enough drugs in this world to wipe my freckin past away

But if feels like just yesterday when I found out my mom just passed away

So much i still have to say but I passed up my only shot

Should of showed you I loved you but I was too busy smoking pot

To busy starting fights and arguments and breaking rules
Hanging out with the wrong group of people cause I thought it made me cool

Now I know I was a fool sorry being such a jerk
And now your dead and I can't take any of it back and now it makes it so much worse

I just wanna be able to wake up in the morning and pretend it doesn't hurt

On the day you died I wondered why the hell you had to go to work

Cause if you didn't you'd still be alive I'd be able to sleep at night

Why the hell would god take me from this planet and leave me behind

You love me, bents?, Monica ,Stacey and my damn brother

It bothers me knowing  my children are never gonna meet there grandmother
You might also likeI just wanna cry actually I wanna die cause the day you passed away I bottled up all Inside

Couple days ago was Mother's Day but you weren't here to celebrate

They say the day you die you always make it to a better place

That may be true but without you i don't know how I'll make it through

You always said you loved me but I never said the same to you

Chorus:

Circles & Cycles and seasons
For everything there's always reason
But it's never good
Never turns out as it should

And now I lay awake in remember? what you did for me

If god is really how is any of this crap ment to be

I loved you so much and now I'll never be able to tell you that

Just to see your face again I'll go to frickn hell and back
But I know your never coming back
I wish I had my mother back
Your the only reason that I'm breathing your only reason why I wanna rap

Everybody wanna try and be able to hold me back and keep me on the ground

They say god real but I keep looking and he's not around
Ain't no body gonna be able to save me I can't save my fricken self

Need some major help cause I don't wanna burn inside the flames of hell

Everything you do in life has gotta be for something right think I need to go to bed and deal with the pain another night

I don't even wanna right but I gotta be able to go with the pain

Someone to save hell with a broke heart but I have a broken brain

I just wanna walk away but I've got a lot to say but I feel like I'm better off dead or put in jail locked away
