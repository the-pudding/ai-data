12 ContributorsLate in the Evening Lyrics[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember
I was lying in my bed
It couldn't have been no more
Than one or two

I remember there's a radio
Coming from the room next door
And my mother laughed
The way some ladies do

When it's late in the evening
And the music's seeping through

[Verse 2]
The next thing I remember
I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right
I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah

And down along the avenue
Some guys were shooting pool
And I heard the sound
Of a cappella grooves, yeah
You might also likeSinging late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

[Verse 3]
Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke
Myself a "J"

And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I
Began to play

And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away

[Verse 4]
The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do

Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way that I loved you
And it was late in the evening
And all the music seeping through

The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do

Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way that I loved you

And it was late in the evening
And all the music seeping throughEmbed
