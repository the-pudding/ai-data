10 ContributorsTeenage Dream Lyrics[BLAINE and THE WARBLERS]

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS harmonizing]
You think I'm pretty
Without any makeup on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright, but things
Were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS (BLAINE)]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die

[THE WARBLERS]
(Until we die)

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS (BLAINE)]
You and I (We'll be young forever!)
You might also likeYou make me (Feel like I'm livin' a) teenage dream
(The way you turn me on)
I can't sleep (Let's run away and)
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
(Now baby, I believe) this is real
(So take a chance and)
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS harmonizing]
We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS (BLAINE)]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die

[THE WARBLERS]
(Until we die)
[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS (BLAINE)]
You and I, (we'll be young forever!)

You make me (feel like I'm livin' a) teenage dream
(The way you turn me on)
I can't sleep (Let's run away and,)
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
(Now baby, I believe) this is real
(So take a chance and)
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back

[BLAINE with THE WARBLERS harmonizing]
I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me

[THE WARBLERS]
(Hands on me)

Be your teenage dream tonight
[THE WARBLERS]
Uh, oh, woah (Tonight, tonight)
Uhhhhhhh... (Tonight, tonight)
