8 ContributorsComing Out of the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why be afraid if I'm not alone?
Though life is never easy, the rest is unknown
And up to now for me, it's been hands against stone
Spent each and every moment searching for what to believe

[Chorus]
Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now
And it's shining on me
Coming out of the dark
I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me

[Verse 2]
Starting again is part of the plan
And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step, I'll make it through, I know I can
It may not make it easier, but I have felt you
Near all the way

[Chorus]
Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now
And it's shining on me
(I see the light, I see the light)
See the light (I see the light)
Coming out of the dark
I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me
You might also like[Bridge]
(And ever, and ever) Ever
I stand on the rock of your love
(And ever) Ever (And ever) Ever, ooh
Can't nobody stop me, watch me
(And ever) Ever (And ever) And ever
Stand on the rock of your love is all it takes
No matter what we face

[Chorus]
(Coming out of the dark)
Coming out of the dark
I see the light, I feel your love shining (Shining, shining)
Yes, shining on me (Shining)
(Coming out of the dark) I know the love that saved me
You're sharing
You're sharing with me (See the light)
You're sharing with me (See the light)
You're sharing with me (See the light)
You're sharing with me (Oh-oh-oh)
(Coming out of the dark)
Cannot be in the dark to make it into the light, yeah
Your love is shining on me
(Shining on me) Shining on me
(I see the light, I see the light)
Shining on me (I see the light)
(Coming out of the dark)
I see the light, I see the light, oh-oh (I see the light)
Got it shining on me (Shining, shining)
I didn't think that I could take it
But your love helped me to make it
(Coming out of the dark) Coming out of the dark
I see the light now
Yes, I see the light now
(Shining, shining) (I see the light, I see the light)Embed
