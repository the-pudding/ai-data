9 ContributorsSomething So Strong Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love can make you weep
Can make you run for cover
Roots that spread so deep
Bring life to frozen ground

[Chorus]
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

[Verse 2]
Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
A taste of jealousy
Is like a lust for gold

[Chorus]
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

[Bridge]
I've been
Feeling so much older
Frame me
And hang me on the wall
I've seen
You fall into the same trap
This thing
Is happening to us all

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today
Something so strong
Something so strong
Something so strong
Something, something so strongEmbed
