Ever since I met you
Seems I can't forget you
The thought of you
Keeps running through the back of my mind
Every time I'm near ya
I get that urge to feel ya
Just touching you
And loving you makes everything right
(Tell me how you feel, baby)

[Chorus: Dionne Warwick & The Spinners, Bobby Smith, Dionne Warwick]
I never knew love before (Oh, no)
Then came you, you
Then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
You

[Verse 2: Dionne Warwick & Bobby Smith, Bobby Smith, Dionne Warwick]
Now that I have found ya
How did I live without ya?
(I don't know, baby)
It's plain to see
You're all I need to satisfy me
I'm so darned proud of ya
I wanna sing about ya
(Sing it, sing it, sing it, baby)
All I know
You made love grow
By touching my hand
Oh, oh
