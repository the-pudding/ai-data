5 ContributorsHow Do I Make You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're a doll
Your eyes see it all
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Wanna see me?

[Verse 2]
You're so young
But your feelings are deep
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Feel for me?

[Chorus]
You put your head on my pillow
And you're fast asleep
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Dream about me?

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, baby
The world's a wall of ice
You're gonna need someone
To treat you warm
And keep you nice
You might also like[Verse 3]
I like the way you dance
The way you spin
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Spin for me?

[Chorus]
You put your head on my pillow
And you're fast asleep
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Dream about me?

[Outro]
Dream about me
Dream about me, woo
Dream about me
Dream about me, woo
Dream about me
Dream about me, woo
Dream about me
Dream about meEmbed
