Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte
Charlotte, don't you cry
Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte
He'll love you till he dies

[Verse 1]
Oh, hold him, darling, please hold him tight
And brush the tear from your eyes
You weep because you had a dream last night
You dreamed that he said goodbye
He held two roses within his hand
Two roses he gave to you
The red rose tells you of his passion
The white rose his love's so true

[Chorus]
Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte
Charlotte, don't you cry
Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte
He'll love you till he dies

[Verse 2]
And every night after he shall die
Yes, every night when he's gone
The wind will sing to you this lullaby
Sweet Charlotte was loved by John
You might also like[Chorus]
Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte
Charlotte, don't you cry
Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte
He'll love you till he diesEmbed
