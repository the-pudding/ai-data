My life is brilliant
[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
[Chorus]
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

[Verse 2]
Yes, she caught my eye
As I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

[Bridge]
Ba, la, la, na
Ba, la, la, na
Ba, la, la, na, na

[Chorus]
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

[Outro]
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you48Embed
