Yeah, yeah, yeah I go a swingin' school
Where the chicks are kicks and the cats are cool
Well we dance the greatest and we dress the latest
Wo, wo, wo I go a swingin' school

Ah, Bobby Ah! Uh huh! Everythings cool, thats cool
We're glad you go to a swingin' school

My little chick is my heart's desire
Well the way we kiss it puts the school on fire

Ah chicks, kicks, cats, cool, yeah school!
Yeah yeah yeah wail!

After school we have to rendezvous

Gonna plan all the things that we're gonna do
Trade bookin' for cookin' and I'll quit my lookin'
When our days at the school are through

Ah, Bobby Ah! Ah hah! Everythings cool, thats cool
We're glad you go to a swingin' school

We live and love by the golden rule
We're gonna settle down at a swingin' school
Well have a house and car, a swimmin' pool
Wo, wo, wo I go a swingin' school
