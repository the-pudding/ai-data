Just a song before I go
To whom it may concern
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned

[Verse 1]
When the shows were over
We had to get back home
And when we opened up the door
I had to be alone

[Verse 2]
She helped me with my suitcase
She stands before my eyes
Driving me to the airport
And to the friendly skies

[Verse 3]
Going through security
I held her for so long
She finally looked at me in love
And she was gone

[Guitar Solo]

Just a song before I go
A lesson to be learned
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burnedEmbed
