39 ContributorsName Lyrics[Verse 1]
And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Get tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

[Chorus]
And now we're grown-up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one, that's a shame
You could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

[Verse 2]
And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
And did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are?

[Chorus]
You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
Then reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

And I won't tell 'em your name
Hmm, mmm-hmm
And I won't tell 'em your name
Oh!

[Outro]
I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are, come back down
And I won't tell 'em your name18Embed
