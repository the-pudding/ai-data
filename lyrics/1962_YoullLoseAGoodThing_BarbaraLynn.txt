8 ContributorsYouâ€™ll Lose A Good Thing Lyrics[Intro]
If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'll lose a good thing
If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'll lose a good thing

[Verse 1]
You know I love you
Do anything for you
Just don't mistreat me
And I'll be good to you
'Cause if you should lose me, oh yeah
You'll lose a good thing

[Verse 2]
I'm giving you one more chance
For you to do right
If you'll only straighten up
We'll have a good life
'Cause if you should lose me, oh yeah
You'll lose a good thing

[Verse 3]
This is my last time
Not asking any more
If you don't do right
I'm gonna march out of that door
And if you don't believe me, just try it daddy
And you'll lose a good thing

Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thing
Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thing
Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thing
Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thing
Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thing
Just try it daddy and you'll lose a good thingEmbed
