7 ContributorsHead to Toe Lyrics[Intro]
Head to toe
I know

[Verse 1]
Today started with a crazy kiss
On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Who would have thought
That we would become lovers?
As friends we were so, so tight
Can't help myself
You make me feel so right
I got to, got to
Got to tell you, darling

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe
I think I love you
From head to toe
I know
You might also like[Verse 2]
Here today
Gone tomorrow
It's possible
But I doubt it
His kiss is credit in the bank of love
I never leave home without it

[Verse 3]
He's different from any boy I know
Body supreme
Bedroom eyes
Head back to the side
Please don't be so mean

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Fourteen karat love
You are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love
Diamonds are forever
Top to bottom
I love you
I will leave you never
I got to, got to
Got to tell you, darling
[Chorus]
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby
I want to kiss you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
You got to know
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe

[Bridge]
I think I love you from head to toe
You can't hurry love
You got to take it slow
But, my angel
You'll get your wings tonight
Baby, you got the love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Fourteen karat love
You are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love
Diamonds are forever
Top to bottom
I love you
I will leave you never
I got to, got to
Got to tell you, darling
[Chorus]
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby
I want to kiss you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
You got to know
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you
From head to toe
I know
Ooh, baby
I want to kiss you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
You got to know

[Outro]
Ooh, baby
I think I love you
From head to toeEmbed
