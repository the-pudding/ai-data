2 ContributorsOver and Over Lyrics[Refrain]
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh

[Verse 1]
Well, I went to a dance just the other night
Everybody there was dead
I said over and over and over again
This dance is gonna be a drag

[Chorus]
I said over and over and over again
This dance is gonna be a drag
I said over and over and over again
This dance is gonna be a drag

[Refrain]
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh

[Verse 2]
All at once it happened
The prettiest in the world
I said a-won't you come over and a-talk to me
And be my girl

[Chorus]
I said a-won't you come over and a-talk to me
And be my girl
I said a-won't you come over and a-talk to me
And be my girl

[Verse 3]
She said she was sorry
And I was a little bit late
She would a-wait and a-wait and a-wait and a-wait
For her steady date

[Chorus]
She would a-wait and a-wait and a-wait and a-wait
For her steady date
She would a-wait and a-wait and a-wait and a-wait
For her steady date

[Refrain]
Ah-ooh, , ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-oohEmbed
