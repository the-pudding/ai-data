Ooh

[Chorus]
Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

[Verse 1]
In and out my life (In and out my life)
You come and you go (You come and you go)
Leaving just your picture behind (Ooo)
And I've kissed it a thousand times (Ooo)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you snap your finger or wink your eye
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings (Can't help myself)
And there's nothing that I can do, ooh

[Chorus]
Can't help myself (Ooh)
No, I can't help myself (Ooh)
'Cause, sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love, you see

Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But every time I see your face (I can't help myself)
I get all choked up inside

[Pre-Chorus]
When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
(Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart)
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide

[Chorus]
'Cause sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I'm weak for you (Weak for you)
Can't help myself
I love you and nobody else (Ooh)
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
Do anything you ask me to (Ask me to)
Can't help myself
I want you and nobody else (Ooh)
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I love you (Love you)
Can't help myself
No, I can't help myself (Ooh)
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I love you1Embed
