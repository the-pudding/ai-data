2 ContributorsMake it Real Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tonight, it's been a year
We met each other here
Well, here I am, all alone
As thoughts of you, go on

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear me cryin' out to you
You said, "Never, never, would I leave?"
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

[Chorus]
I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart, you're in my heart
Give me one more chance to make it real

[Verse 2]
In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart, I'll pretend
That you are here again

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear me cryin' out to you
You said, "Never, never, would I leave?"
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me
You might also like[Chorus]
I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart, you're in my heart
Give me one more chance to make it real

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart, you're in my heart
Give me one more chance to make it real
Give me one more chance to make it realEmbed
