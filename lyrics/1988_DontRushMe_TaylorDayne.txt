5 ContributorsDonâ€™t Rush Me Lyrics[Intro]
Ah

[Verse 1]
Red roses, temptation
You make the most of a iffy situation
I'm weighing my decision
Who's to say if it's love or if it isn't?

[Pre-Chorus]
Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you
Don't mean to lead you on
But I want to take it slowly, slowly

[Chorus]
So don't rush me
I made that mistake before, oh-woah-oh
Don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth waiting for

[Verse 2]
Desire can mean danger
I want a lover, not another stranger
I'm saving all my passion
Who's to say if its love or just attraction?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you
Don't mean to lead you on
But I want to take it slowly, slowly

[Chorus]
So don't rush me
I made that mistake before, oh-woah-oh
Don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth waiting
Don't rush me
I made that mistake before, oh-woah-oh
Don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth waiting

[Bridge]
And my resistance is weakening, weakening
Every time we touch
'Cause baby, you get everything, everything
That I've been dreamin' of

[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
So don't rush me
I made that mistake before, oh-woah-oh
Don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth waiting

[Outro]
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before, oh no-no-no-no
Don't rush me
This love could be so much more, yeah, yeah
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
Don't rush me
This love could be so much more
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake beforeEmbed
