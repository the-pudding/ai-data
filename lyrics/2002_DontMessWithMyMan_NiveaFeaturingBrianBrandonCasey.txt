[Verse 1: Nivea]
It was hard to find a brother that was down for me
So I'm tellin' everybody let him be
'Cause he's mine and I can't take no pigeons tryin' to take my baby
So I thought I had to let you know
Find someone you can call your own
'Cause, now you're walkin' in the danger zone
And if I touch you, I'll be wrong

[Chorus 1: Nivea]
If you mess with my man
I'ma be the one to bring it to ya
Got my girls, got my man
So find your own and leave mine alone
Don't mess with my man
I'ma be the one to bring it to ya
Here's a little advice for you, find your own man

So you know you will be dealt with
Better find your own, own girl
