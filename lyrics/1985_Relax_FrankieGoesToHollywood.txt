Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it

When you want to come
Relax, don't do it
When you want to suck it, chew it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come

Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Relax don't do it
When you want to suck it, chew it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
