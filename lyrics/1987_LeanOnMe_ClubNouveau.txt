9 ContributorsLean on Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Thomas McElroy with Valerie Wilson]
Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

[Chorus: All, Samuelle Prater, Valerie Wilson, Jay King, Denzil Foster & Valerie Wilson, Valerie Wilson]
Lean on me
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (Lean on me)
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

[Verse 2: Thomas McElroy with Valerie Wilson]
Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill
Those of your needs
That you won't let show

[Chorus: All, Samuelle Prater, Valerie Wilson, Jay King, Denzil Foster & Valerie Wilson, Valerie Wilson]
Lean on me
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (Lean on me)
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
You might also like[Bridge: Samuelle Prater]
So just call on me brother
When you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem
That you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

[Chorus: Samuelle Prater, Valerie Wilson, Jay King, Denzil Foster & Valerie Wilson, Valerie Wilson]
Lean on me
When you're not strong (When you're not strong)
And I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (Lean on me)
For said, it won't be long (Won't be too long)
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
