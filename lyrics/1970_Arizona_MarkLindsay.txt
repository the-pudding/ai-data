10 ContributorsArizona Lyrics[Verse 1]
She must belong to San Francisco
She must have lost her way
Postin' a poster of Pancho and Cisco
One California day
She said she believes in Robin Hood and brotherhood
And colors of green and grey
And all you can do is laugh at her
Doesn't anybody know how to pray?

[Chorus]
Arizona, take off your rainbow shades
Arizona, have another look at the world, my, my
Arizona, cut off your Indian braids
Arizona, hey, won't ya go my way?

[Verse 2]
Mm, strip off your pride, you're acting like a teeny-bopper runaway child
And scrape off the paint from the face of a little town saint

[Chorus]
Arizona, take off your hobo shoes
Arizona, hey, won't ya go my way?

[Bridge]
Follow me up to San Francisco
I will beguide your way
I'll be the Count of Monte Cristo
You'll be the Countess May
And you can believe in Robin Hood and brotherhood
And rolling the ball in the hay
And I will be reading you an Aesop's fable
Anything to make you stay
You might also like[Chorus]
Arizona, take off your rainbow shades
Arizona, have another look at the world, my, my
Arizona, cut off your Indian braids
Arizona, hey, won't ya go my way? Hey
Arizona, take off your hobo shoes
Arizona, have another look at the world, my, my
Arizona, get off your eight-ball blues
Arizona, hey, won't ya go my way? Come on, hey

[Outro]
Arizona, take off your rainbow shades, hey
