9 ContributorsIâ€™ll Stand By You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, why you look so sad?
The tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
'Cause I've seen the dark side too

[Verse 2]
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

[Chorus 1]
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
I won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

[Verse 3]
So, if you're mad, get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide?
I get angry too
Well, I'm a lot like you

When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
'Cause even if you're wrong

[Chorus]
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
I won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into you darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

[Bridge]
And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You're feeling all alone
You won't be on your own

[Chorus]
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
I won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into you darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
[Outro]
Oh, I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you5Embed
