[Verse 1]
Danger in the shape of something wild
Stranger dressed in black, she's a hungry child
No one knows who she is or what her name is
I don't know where she came from or what her game is

[Chorus]
Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty
Hot child in the city

[Verse 2]
So young to be loose and on her own
Young boys, they all want to take her home
When she comes downtown, the boys all stop and stare
When she comes downtown, she walks like she just don't care
Yeah

[Chorus]
Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty
Yeah
Hot child in the city

Come on down to my place baby, we'll talk about love
Come on down to my place baby, we'll make love

[Outro]
Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city (she's kinda dangerous)
Hot child in the city (a young child)
Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty (a young child, runnin' wild)
Hot child in the city (a hot child in the city)
Hot child in the city (hot child in the city)
Hot child in the city (hot child in the city)
Hot child in the city (hot child in the city)
Hot child in the city (ohh)
