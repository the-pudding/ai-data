16 ContributorsBlue Jean Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blue Jean, I just met me a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
(Oh, somebody send me)

[Verse 2]
One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember like everybody has to wait in line
Oh, Blue Jean, look out world, oh you know I've got mine
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
She got Latin roots
She got everything

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can tempt me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody sent me
(Oh, somebody send me)

{Hook}

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can tempt me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody sent me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody, somebody
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
(Oh, somebody send me)11Embed
