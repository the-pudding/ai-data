4 ContributorsBarefootinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody, get on your feet
You make me nervous when you're in your seat
Take off your shoes and pat your feet
We're doin' a dance that can't be beat

[Chorus]
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'

[Verse 2]
Went to a party the other night
Long Tall Sally was out of sight
Threw away her wig, and her high sneakers, too
She was doin' a dance without any shoes

[Chorus]
She was barefootin'
She was barefootin'
She was barefootin'
She was barefootin'

[Verse 3]
Hey, little girl with your red dress on
I bet you can barefoot all night long
Take off your shoes and throw 'em away
Come back and get 'em another day
You might also like[Chorus]
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'

[Bridge]
Everybody get barefootin'
Take off your shoes

[Verse 4]
Li'l John Henry, he said to Sue
"If I was barefootin' would you barefoot, too"?
Sue told John, "I'll stir your stew
I was barefootin' ever since I was two"

[Chorus]
They were barefootin'
They were barefootin'
They were barefootin'
We're barefootin'

[Outro]
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
Ah-ha
We're barefootin'
We're barefootin'
Don't have no shoes on
We're barefootin'Embed
