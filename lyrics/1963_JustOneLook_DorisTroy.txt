Just one look, and I fell so hard
In love with you, oh-oh, oh-oh
I found out how good it feels
To have, your love, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Say you will, will be mine
Forever and always, oh-oh, oh-oh
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one
Oh-oh-oh-ooh

[Bridge]
I thought I was dreamin'
But I was wrong, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on schemin'
'Til I can make you, make you my own

[Verse 3]
So you see, I really care
Without you I'm nothin', oh-oh, oh-oh
Just one look and I know
I'll get you someday, , oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus/Outro]
Just one look, that's all it took
Just one look, that's all it took
Just one look, that's all it took
Just one look, that's all it tookYou might also likeEmbed
