64 ContributorsSummertime Lyrics[Intro]
Drums, please!

[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to Summer Madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody go
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime
You might also like[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 3]
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah, I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
'Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to your crib change your clothes once more
'Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends 'cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kissed
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout, it looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness
[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind11Embed
