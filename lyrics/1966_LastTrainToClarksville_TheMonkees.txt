Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be here by four thirty
'Cause I've made your reservation
Don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning
And I must see you again
We'll have one more night together (Train)
'Til the morning brings my train and I must go
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home

[Verse 3]
Take the last train to Clarksville (Train)
I'll be waiting at the station
We'll have time for coffee-flavored kisses (Train)
And a bit of conversation, oh
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
You might also like[Bridge]
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

[Verse 4]
Take the last train to Clarksville
Now I must hang up the phone
I can't hear you in this noisy railroad station all alone
I'm feeling low
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home

[Verse 5]
Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be here by four thirty (Train)
'Cause I made your reservation
Don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home

[Outro]
Take the last train to Clarksville (Train)
Take the last train to Clarksville (Train)
Take the last train to Clarksville (Train)
Take the last train to Clarksville (Train)2Embed
