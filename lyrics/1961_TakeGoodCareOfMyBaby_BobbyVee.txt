My tears are fallin'
'Cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's somethin' that I've got to say

[Verse 1]
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinkin' of her
In everything you say and do

[Verse 2]
Oh, take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky

[Bridge]
Once upon a time
That little girl was mine
If I'd been true
I know she'd never be with you

So, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Well, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

[Outro]
Oh, take good care of my baby
Well, take good care of my baby
Just take good care of my baby3Embed
