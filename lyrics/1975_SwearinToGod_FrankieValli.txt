[Chorus: Frankie Valli]
Swearin' to God
There's no one else on earth I'd rather be
Mmmmmm, Swearin' to God
You made me see, so I believed in you

[Verse 1: Frankie]
Oh, you've been fillin' my cup
'Til I'm runnin' over with joy
From your heaven sent love
Just touch me again
I'm king of all men
And reigning from above

[Chorus: Frankie & Patti Austin]
Swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
You're mistress of the world and all I am
(Don't tell the angels)
Swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
You're where I won in paradise began

[Verse 2: Frankie]
No one gets me up there like you can
But girl, you know I'm only human
You might also like[Chorus: Frankie & Patti]
And I'm swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
So glad he's given me you

[Bridge: Frankie & Patti]
I was born for you, baby
Girl, ain't you glad we made it
Made to give my heart and soul to you, baby
I'm so very glad you gave it
Hey, baby, we're together
Try to live on forever as long (as long)
As we live (as we live)

[Chorus: Frankie & Patti]
Swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
I dedicate my life to loving you
Oh, I'm swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
I'd cross my heart and hope to die, I do
Just call me your one woman lover
I can't even look at another
Girl, I'm swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
So glad I'm livin'
I'm swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
For all he's given me
Swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
So glad he's given me you
[Chorus: Frankie & Patti]
Well, swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
Look what he's given me (swearin' to God)
More than the world can see (swearin' to God)
He's given me you, oh

[Instrumental]
Swearin' to God
Ooh, so help me, I'm in love with you
Swearin' to God
Ooh, so help me, swearin' to God
Swearin' to God
Ooh, so help me, I'm in love with you
I swear it
Ooh, I do
Believe me
I love you
Mm, baby
Mm, mm, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
Hey, baby, we're together
Try to live on forever as long (as long)
As we live (as we live)
[Chorus: Frankie & Patti]
Swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
I dedicate my life to loving you
(Don't tell the angels)
Yeah, I'm swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
I'd cross my heart and hope to die, I do
Just call me your one woman lover
I can't even look at another

So glad I'm livin'
I'm swearin' to God (swearin' to God)
