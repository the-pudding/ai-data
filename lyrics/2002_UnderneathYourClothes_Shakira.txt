You're a song written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

[Verse 2]
'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a, ah, ah

[Bridge]
I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
You know it's true, oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

[Instrumental Break 02:30-02:52]
[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
Underneath your clothes, woah-oh-oh
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl14Embed
