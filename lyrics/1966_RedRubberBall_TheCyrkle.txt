5 ContributorsRed Rubber Ball Lyrics[Verse 1]
I should have known
You'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Now, I know you're not
The only starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin'
Like a red rubber ball

[Verse 2]
You never care
For secrets I confide
For you, I'm just an ornament
Something for your pride
Always runnin', never carin'
That's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give
You might also like[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin'
Like a red rubber ball

[Verse 3]
The story's in the past
With nothing to recall
I've got my life to live
And I don't need you at all
The rollercoaster ride we took
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That's all I'm gonna spend

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin'
Like a red rubber ball, woah, oh, oh
Oh, I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining
Like a red rubber ballEmbed
