54 ContributorsEverybody Talks Lyrics[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ahem, ahem

[Verse 1]
Hey, baby, won't you look my way?
I can be your new addiction
Hey, baby, what you got to say?
All you're giving me is fiction
I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I find out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks

[Chorus]
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always gotta backtrack
When everybody talks back

[Verse 2]
Hey, honey, you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash-talk make me itchin'
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my, my, shit, everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks too much

[Chorus]
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

[Bridge]
Never thought I'd live to see the day (Ah-ah)
When everybody's words got in the way, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Hey, sugar, show me all your love
All you're giving me is friction
Hey, sugar, what you gotta say?

[Chorus]
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back
[Post-Chorus]
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks back

[Outro]
It started with a whisper
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
And that was when I kissed her
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
Everybody talks, everybody talks back, uh43Embed
