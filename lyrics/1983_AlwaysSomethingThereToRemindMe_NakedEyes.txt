I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take reminds me of just how we used to be

[Chorus]
Oh, how can I forget you, girl?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

[Verse 2]
When shadows fall, I pass a small caf√© where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight

[Chorus]
Oh, how can I forget you, girl?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

[Post-Chorus]
I was born to love her
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me, oh-woah-oh

[Verse 3]
If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just come back to the places where we used to go and I'll be there
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, how can I forget you, girl?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

[Post-Chorus]
I was born to love her
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

[Outro]
'Cause there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me6Embed
