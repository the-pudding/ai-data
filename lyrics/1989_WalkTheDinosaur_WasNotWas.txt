[Verse 1]
It was a night like this forty million years ago
I lit a cigarette, picked up a monkey skull to go
The sun was spitting fire, the sky was blue as ice
I felt a little tired, so I watched Miami Vice

[Pre-Chorus]
I walked the dinosaur
I walked the dinosaur

[Chorus]
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur

Boom boom acka lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka lacka boom boom
Boom boom acka lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka lacka boom boom

[Verse 2]
I met you in a cave, you were painting buffalo
I said I'd be your slave, follow wherever you go
That night we split a rattlesnake and danced beneath the stars
You fell asleep, I stayed awake and watched the passing cars

[Pre-Chorus]
And walked the dinosaur
I walked a dinosaur

[Chorus]
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
[Bridge]
One night I dreamed of New York
You and I roasting blue pork in the Statue of Liberty's torch
Elvis landed in a rock-rock-rocket ship
Healed a couple of lepers
Ah, and disappeared
But where was his beard?

[Verse 3]
A shadow from the sky, much too big to be a bird
A screaming, crashing noise louder than I've ever heard
It looked like two big silver trees that somehow learned to soar
Suddenly a summer breeze and a mighty lion's roar

[Pre-Chorus]
I killed a dinosaur
I killed a dinosaur

[Chorus]
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the dinosaur
