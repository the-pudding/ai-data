7 ContributorsLittle Green Apples Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says, "Hi"
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school, "Goodbye"
And she reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says, "How ya feeling, hon?"
And I look across at smiling lips
That warm my heart and see my morning sun

[Pre-Chorus]
And if that's not loving me (Loving me)
Then all I've got to say (Got to say)

[Chorus]
Oh, God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Disneyland, Mother Goose, there's no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when my self is feeling low
I think about her face aglow to ease my mind

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I call her up at home
Knowing she's busy (She's busy)
And ask if she could get away
And meet me and grab a bite to eat (A bite to eat)
And she drops what she's doing
And she hurries down to meet me and I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently
And smiles when she first sees me 'cause she's made that way (Made that way)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
If that's not loving me (Loving me)
Woah, all I've got to say (Got to say)

[Chorus]
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make-believe
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves, and BB guns
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
Hey, and when my self is feeling low
I think about her face aglow to ease my mindEmbed
