12 ContributorsMe and You and a Dog Named Boo Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember to this day the bright red Georgia clay
And how it stuck to the tires after the summer rain
Will power made that old car go
A woman's mind told me that so
Oh how I wish we were back on the road again

[Chorus]
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

[Verse 2]
I can still recall the wheat fields of St. Paul
And the morning we got caught robbing from an old hen
Old McDonald he made us work
But then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again

[Chorus]
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man
You might also like[Verse 3]
I'll never forget the day we motored stately into big L.A
The lights of the city put settling down in my brain
Though it's only been a month or so
That old car's bugging us to go
We've gotta get away and get back on the road again

[Chorus]
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

[Chorus]
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

[Chorus]
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land
Me and you and a dog3Embed
