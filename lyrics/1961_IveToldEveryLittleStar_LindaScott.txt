7 ContributorsIâ€™ve Told Every Little Star LyricsWhy haven't I told you?

I've told every little star
Just how sweet I think you are
Why haven't I told you?

I've told ripples in a brook
Made my heart an open book
Why haven't I told you?

Friends ask me am I in love
I always answer yes
Might as well confess
If the answer's yes

Maybe you may love me too
Oh my darling if you do
Why haven't you told me?

Friends ask me am I in love
I always answer yes
Might as well confess
If the answer's yes

Maybe you may love me too
Oh my darling if you do
Why haven't you told me?You might also likeEmbed
