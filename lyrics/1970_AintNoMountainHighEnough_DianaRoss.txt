Aaaah, aaah
Aaaah, ooh
Oooh
Ooh, aaaah, aaah
Aaaah, ooh
Oooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry
You see, my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling, let it be me

[Chorus]
Aah-aah, ooh
Aaah aah
Aaah aah aah
Oooh, ooh

I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words:

[Bridge]
No wind (No wind), no rain (No rain)
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me, babe (Oh, babe), baby (Daby)
If you're my goal (Oh)
No wind (No wind), no rain (No rain)
Can stop me, babe
If you are my goal

[Chorus]
Aah-aah aah
Aaah, ooh, aah
Aaah, aah ah
Oooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
I know, I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me
And if you should miss my lovin'
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close
Or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free
[Refrain]
Ain't no mountain high enough (Aah)
Ain't no valley low enough (Ooh)
Ain't no river wide enough (Ah, oh)
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough (Ow!)
Ain't no valley low enough (Say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough (Hey, hey)
To keep me from you

[Refrain]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
Keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough (No)
Nothing can keep me
Keep me from you

[Outro]
Ain't no mountain high enough (Oh, oh)
Ain't no valley low enough (Say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough (Again, again)
To keep me from you (Ooh)
Ain't no mountain high enough (Ain't no mountain high enough)
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough (Nothing can keep me)
Keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough (Nothing in this world)
Ain't no valley low enough (Nothing in this world)
Ain't no river wide enough (Can keep me from you, babe)
Keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough (Just call my name)
Ain't no valley low enough (I'll be there in a hurry)
Ain't no river wide enough (Just call my name)
Keep me from you (I'll be right there)
Ain't no mountain high enough (Ain't no mountain high enough)
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough (Nothing can keep me)
Keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough (Ooh)
Ain't no valley low enough (Say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough (Oh, say it like you feel it)
Keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough (No wind, no rain)
Ain't no valley low enough (Can stop me now)7Embed
