11 ContributorsGimme Little Sign Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you do want me, gimme little sugar
If you don't want me, don't lead me on, girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me
And when I'm feelin' blue, and I want you
There's just one thing that you should do

[Chorus]
Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my baby
To show me that you're mine, girl, oh yeah
Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my darlin'
To show me that you're mine, girl, all right

[Verse 2]
If you do want me, give me little sweet talk
If you don't want me, don't lead me on, girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me
And when I'm feelin' down, wearin' a frown
You'll be there when I look around

[Chorus]
Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my baby
To show me that you're mine, girl, all right
Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my baby
To show me that you're mine, girl, all right, huh!

Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my darlin'
To show me that you're mine, girl, all right

[Chorus/Outro]
Just gimme some kind of sign
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, sign
Just gimme some kind of sign, girl, oh, my baby
To show me that you're mine, girl, all right
Just gimme some kind of sign...2Embed
