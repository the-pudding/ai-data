(Stay in my corner)
You'll make me oh so proud
Stay darling, please, stay
(Stay in my corner)
To the world I'd cry out loud
How I love you
Honey, I love you, I really love you
(Stay, stay, stay, stay)
Please, please, please

Stay darling
(Stay in my corner)
And I will never, never let you down
Just say you'll stay
(Stay in my corner)
'Cause I will need you always around
To tell me you love me
Honey, you love me, so darling stay
(Stay, stay, stay)

There'll be times when I may fail
And I'll need your love to sometimes comfort me
Bitter days may prevail
But just a kiss from you
Will make them sweet
