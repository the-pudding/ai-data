Out on the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze
Sweet, sweet Connie and doing her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact
Up all night with Freddy King
I got to tell you poker's his thing
A-booze 'n ladies keep me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band

{Hook}
Four young chiquitas in Omaha
Awaitin' for the band to return from the show
I'm feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night
The hotel detective -- he was out-a-sight
Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, "Come on, dudes, let's get it on,"
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down
