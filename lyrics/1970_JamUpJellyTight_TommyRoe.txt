2 ContributorsJam Up And Jelly Tight Lyrics[Chorus]
Jam up and jelly tight
My, my, my, my, baby
Now you're outta sight
Jam up and jelly tight
You look a little naughty
But you're so polite
Jam up and jelly tight
You won't say you will
But there's a chance that you might

[Verse 1]
I said, the first day I met you
"Someday, I'm gonna pet you"
Now you're here and baby I love it
So come on and give me some lovin'

[Chorus]
Jam up and jelly tight
My, my, my, my, baby
Now you're outta sight
Jam up and jelly tight
You look a little naughty
But you're so polite
Jam up and jelly tight
You won't say you will
But there's a chance that you might
You might also like[Verse 2]
You've got a sweet disposition
So come on and give me permission
For one kiss and maybe another
We'll see if we're meant for each other

[Chorus]
Jam up and jelly tight
My, my, my, my, baby
Now you're outta sight
Jam up and jelly tight
You look a little naughty
But you're so polite

[Outro]
Jam up and jelly tight
Jam up and jelly tight, yeah
Jam up and jelly tight, yeah
Jam up and jelly tight, yeah...Embed
