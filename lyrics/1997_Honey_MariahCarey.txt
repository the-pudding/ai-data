Let's go

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey & Styles P]
Oh honey, you can have me when you want me (Ooh)
If you simply ask me to be there
Uh-huh
And you're the only one who makes me come runnin'
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & Styles P]
And it's just like honey (Yeah)
When your love comes over me (When your love comes over me)
That's right
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey
You might also like[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya (Cryin', mmh)
One hit of your love addicted me (Yeah)
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see? (Every night)
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey (No, honey)

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside (Oh, honey)
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey & Styles P]
Yeah, yeah, oh, I can't be elusive with you, honey
I like that
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you
Yeah
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
Uh-huh

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (When your love comes over me)
Oh baby, I've got a dependency (So dependent to ya, honey)
Always strung out for another taste of your honey (Honey)
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet (Oh)
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya (I need you bad)
One hit of your love addicted me (Ooh, your love addicted me)
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see? (I can't wait for another)
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

And Mariah, you're on fire
How good it feels inside (Gotta have another taste)
Harlem world, we won't stop
So Mariah, take us higher
Honey I can't describe (I gotta have you now, come on baby)
Harlem world, we won't stop (I need your honey right now)
How good it feels inside
And Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem world, we won't stop
So Mariah, take us higher (Come sweeten me with your honey)
