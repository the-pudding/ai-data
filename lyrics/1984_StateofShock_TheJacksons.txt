Yeah, come on, baby

[Verse 1]
You gotta be mine
'Cause you're so fine
I like your style
It makes me wild
You take it to me good
You like it, know you should
You get me on my knees
Well, please, baby, please

[Chorus]
Listen
She looks so great every time I see her face
She put me in a state, a state of shock

[Interlude]
Oh, do it
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
Come on, baby

[Verse 2]
She put me on my knees
Please, baby, please
I know you like to tease
Please, baby, please
You take it to me good
You like it, know you should
I love the way you walk
And talk, baby, talk
