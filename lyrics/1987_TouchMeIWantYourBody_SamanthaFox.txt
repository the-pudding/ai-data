Ah, touch me, touch me
This is the night
Touch me, touch me
I wanna feel your body

[Verse 1]
Full moon in the city and the night was young
I was hungry for love, I was hungry for fun
I was hunting you down and I was the bait
When I saw you there, I didn't need to hesitate

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the night, this is the night
This is the time, we've got to get it right (This is the night)

[Chorus]
Touch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now

[Verse 2]
Quick as a flash, you disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you, boy? Didn't I treat you right?
You made me feel so good, made me feel myself
Now I'm alone and you're with somebody else
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
This is the night, yeah, this is the night
This is the time, we've got to get it right (This is the night)

[Chorus]
Touch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now

[Bridge]
Hot and cold emotions confusin' my brain
I could not decide between pleasure and pain
Like a tramp in the night, I was beggin' for you
To treat my body like you wanted to (Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
Oh, I was beggin' for you (This is the night)

[Chorus]
Touch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (This is the night)
'Cause I want your body all the time (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (This is the night)
'Cause I want your body all the time
[Outro]
Ah, touch me, touch me, touch me (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me, touch me (This is the night)
Ah, touch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body (This is the night)
Touch me, touch me, touch me (This is the night)
