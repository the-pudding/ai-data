25 ContributorsSoul Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Comin' to you on a dusty road
Good lovin', I got a truckload
And when you get it, you got something
So don't worry, cause I'm coming

[Chorus]
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, come on!
I'm a soul man
That ain't all, look

[Verse 2]
That's what I got, the hard way
And I'll make it better each and every day
So honey, don't you fret, heh
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

[Chorus]
I'm a soul man, oh lord
I'm a soul man, play it, Steve
I'm a soul man, ha!
I'm a soul man, oh

[Verse 3]
I was brought up on a side street, listen now
I learned how to love before I could eat
I was educated at Woodstock
When I start lovin', oh, I can't stop
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm a soul man, yes I am
(I wanna tell you)
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, yeah
I'm a soul man, look!

[Bridge]
Grab a rope
And I'll pull you in
Give you hope
And be your only boyfriend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I'm talkin' about a soul man
(I'm a) Soul man
(And you a) Soul man
(I'm a) Soul man, oh no
Soul man, I'm a soul man
(And you a) Soul man
(And you're a) Soul man...6Embed
