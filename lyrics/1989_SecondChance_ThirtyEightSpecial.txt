5 ContributorsJuice Lyrics[Verse 1: Carl Sherron]
I heard you robbed a couple niggas down on forty-deuce
You and your crew
You only fifteen, what the fuck you know about twenty-two's?
Slow down before you get your melon split or knocked by jake's
Cause nowadays, niggas act tough but be on some telling shit
I learned the hard way, ninth grade I use to play the raw way
Till I was tested, pulled out a weapon and caught that court case
Mom stressing, taking off work, rushing to court dates
While pops angry, telling me Lico, go get your shit straight
Believe me fam', I know G's
I was deep as a Spartan with my co-deez
If you about that, do it fadoli
Use your minds eye, think for a second before you flex your desert
Respect is something that's earned, I hope you take head to this message
It's ill in the boogie down
Some niggas came through looking for you hoodie down
Mobbing six deep, gripping a four pound
You think you thugged out, but the way I see it you bugged out
Could barely stand up straight, angel dust got you strung out
Wow, you got the juice now

[Verse 2: Wati Heru]
Underneath the shadows of the two train, we hop turnstiles
The barrel spin like turn tables when the parties turned out
In return we turn the wrist a turning point eternally
The burner twist determine if he returns from eternity
Don't be concerned with this, we firm with this like Escobar and Fox
Never spent a term on D block but yet a nigga picking locks
We shoulda known better like case after we saw the cops
Still no strangers stand by my spot
They exit or they're getting ox'd
By any God given chance I turn myself in
My attorney's in a fraternity, he'll turn that twenty-five into ten
I'll do that bid, get big, turn twenty-five into ten
Same cycle, stretch turn twenty-five outta' ten
So while they turning in they grave, I'm still collecting this yen
Same corner, thirty-eight special in the side of the Timb's
And if the jake turn the curb, I'm putting five into them
So now the table turn, El Ragga still survives in the end
Cause if I turn over the juice, another saga begins
You might also like[Outro: Wati Heru]
Said I was whylin' out, I got the juice now
Look who's whylin' now, you got the juice now

[Outro 2: Bishop]
What's the matter Raheem? Nothing to say?
That's cause you know I'm right
In your heart you know I'm right

[Q]
Yo big man, if you want respect you gotta earn it

[Bishop]
You damn right
You gotta be ready to go down, stand up, and die for that shit like Blizzard did
If you want some juice

[Q]
Blizzard? Blizzard ain't sticking up to nothing now

[Bishop]
That's cause we wasn't there to back him up
If we was there-

[Q]
If we was there there'd be five dead niggas instead of oneEmbed
