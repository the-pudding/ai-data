To do do, down dooby doo down down
Comma comma, down dooby doo down down
Comma comma, down dooby doo down down
Breaking up is hard to do

[Verse 1]
Don't take your love away from me!
Don't you leave my heart in misery?
If you go, then I'll be blue!
'Cuz breaking up is hard to do

[Verse 2]
Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

[Chorus]
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now, I know, I know that it's true!
Don't say that this is the end!
Instead of breaking up, I wish we were making up again

[Verse 3]
I beg of you, don't say goodbye!
Can't we give our love another try?
Come on, baby, let's start a new!
'Cuz breaking up is hard to do

I beg of you, don't say goodbye!
Can't we give our love another try?
Come on, baby, let's start a new!
'Cuz breaking up is hard to do
