Those oldies but goodies reminds me of you
The songs of the past bring back memories of you
I always remember the first night we met
The songs they were playing I never will forget
I always will treasure them so close to my heart
They always will haunt me although we're apart
Each time that I hear them a tear's bound to fall
For I love those memories that I, I-I recall
Those oldies but goodies reminds me of you
The songs of the past bring back memories of you
Forever they will haunt me but what can I do?
Those oldies but goodies reminds me of
You
(Oldies but goodies reminds me of you)
SPOKEN: "Yes, dear, they are playin' our songs. And they will always remain our
Songs. And each time you hear them, I hope you, too, will cherish the wonderful
Memories that our love once knew. For these songs are just a symbol of the
Love that I had for you."
