It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "Be of good cheer!"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Verse 1]
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
Oh, the most wonderful time of the yearEmbed
