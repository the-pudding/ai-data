Step right up and don't be shy
Because you will not believe your eyes
She's right here behind the glass
You're gonna like her 'cause she's got class

[Pre-Chorus]
You can look inside another world
You get to talk to a pretty girl
She's everything you dream about

[Chorus]
But, don't fall in love!
She's a beauty
She's one in a million girls
She's a beauty
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?

[Verse 2]
You can say anything you like
But you can't touch the merchandise
She'll give you every penny's worth
But, it will cost you a dollar first

[Pre-Chorus]
You can step outside your little world
Step outside your world
You can talk to a pretty girl
She's everything you dream about
You might also like[Chorus]
But, don't fall in love!
She's a beauty
She's one in a million girls
One in a million girls
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?

[Chorus]
But, don't fall in love!
'Cause if you do, you'll find out she don't love you
She's one in a million girls
One in a million girls
Why would I lie?
Now, why would I lie? Oh!

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Step outside your world

[Chorus]
But, don't fall in love!
She's a beauty
She's one in a million girls
One in a million girls
Why would I lie?
Now, why would I lie?
[Chorus]
But, don't fall in love!
'Cause if you do, you'll find out she won't love you
She's one in a million girls
One in a million girls
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?

[Outro]
But, don't fall in love!
She's one in a million girls
Why would I lie?Embed
