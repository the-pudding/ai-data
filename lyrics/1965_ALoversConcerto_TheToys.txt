6 ContributorsA Loverâ€™s Concerto LyricsHow gentle is the rain
That falls softly on the meadow?
Birds, high up in the trees
Serenade the clouds with their melodies

Oh, see, there beyond the hill
The bright colors of the rainbow
Some magic from above
Made this day for us just to fall in love

Now, I belong to you
From this day until forever
Just love me tenderly
And I'll give to you every part of me

Oh, don't ever make me cry
Through long, lonely nights without us
Be always true to me
Keep this day in your heart eternally

Someday we shall return
To this place upon the meadow
We'll walk out in the rain
Hear the birds above singing once again

Oh, you'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
You might also likeYou'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful

You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderfulEmbed
