10 ContributorsNever Had a Dream Come True Lyrics[Intro: Jo]
Ooh-ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1: Jo]
Everybody's got something
They had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday
That just seems to grow with time

[Pre-Chorus: Jo]
There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
How it could be now or might have been (Or might have been)
All this I know, but still, I can't find ways to let you go

[Chorus: All]
I never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (Never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (The one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you, yeah

[Verse 2: Jo]
Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
And tomorrow can never be
'Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Jo]
There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
How it should be now or might have been (Or might have been)
All this I know, but still, I can't find ways to let you go

[Chorus: All]
I never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (Never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (The one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be

[Bridge: Jo]
You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes, you will, say you will, you know you will, oh, baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget

[Pre-Chorus: Jo]
There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
Because love is a strange and funny thing (And funny thing)
No matter how I try and try (How I try), I just can't say goodbye
No, no, no, no
[Chorus: All]
I've never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (Never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (The one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be

[Outro: Jo]
A part of me will always be with you
