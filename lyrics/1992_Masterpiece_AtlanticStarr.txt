10 ContributorsMasterpiece Lyrics[Verse 1]
A simple touch of your hand
And everything is right
The gentle way you look at me
When we kiss goodnight
You've given me the freedom
No other love has known
And now, I thank you, girl (Thank you, girl)
Thank you, girl (Thank you, girl)

[Verse 2]
The countless ways
You've touched my heart
Is more than I can say (More than I can say)
The beauty that you've shown to me
Takes my breath away (Takes my breath away)
A picture perfect painting
That's what our love is
And, yes I need you so (Need you so)
And now I know (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art, it's true
And I treasure you, my love (Ooh, ooh)
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art, it's true
And I treasure you

Sometimes I wonder
What I'd be had I not found you

This world could show me nothing new
But now my life's a canvas
Painted with your love
And it will always be (Always be)
And now, I see (Ah)

[Verse 4]
The gentle walks together
Through time we'll never part (Time we'll never part)
This fairytale we shared
Is real inside our hearts (Real inside)
Let it be forever
Never let it end
This promise I can make
Heaven is ours to take (Ooh, ooh)

A work of art, it's true

When I'm lost and insecure (Ah)
You build me up and make me sure (Ah)
