Your love, lifted me higher
Than I've ever, been lifted before
So keep it it up
Quench my desire
And I'll be at your side
Forever more

[Chorus]
You know your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

[Verse 2]
Listen
Now once I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But then you came and it soon departed
And you know he never
Showed his face again
You might also like[Chorus]
That's why your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting me (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
Alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'm so glad, I finally found you
Yes, that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
Honey, I can stand up
And face the world

[Chorus]
Let me tell you, your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting me (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
And I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
[Outro]
Alright, now sock it to me (lifting, lifting, lifting)
Alright, lift me up woman (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep my love going, now (lifting me)
Higher and higher
I said keep on lifting (lifting, lifting,lifting)
Lift me up mama (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting me (lifting me)
