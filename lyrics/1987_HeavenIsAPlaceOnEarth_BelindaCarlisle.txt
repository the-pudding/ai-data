Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
They say in Heaven, love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth

[Verse 1]
When the night falls down
I wait for you and you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids on the street outside
[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinnin' with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
They say in Heaven, love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth

When I feel alone
I reach for you and you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice and it carries me

[Pre-Chorus]
In this world, we're just beginnin'
To understand the miracle of livin'
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore
[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
They say in Heaven, love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
