One more night
One more night

[Verse 1]
I've been trying, ooh, so long
To let you know, let you know how I feel
And if I stumble, if I fall, just help me back
So I can make you see

[Chorus]
Please give me one more night
Give me one more night
One more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (Ooh-ooh-hoo)
Give me just one more night
Ooh, just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (Ooh-ooh-hoo)

[Verse 2]
I've been sitting here so long
Wasting time, just staring at the phone
And I was wondering should I call you
Then I thought maybe you're not alone
You might also like[Chorus]
Please give me one more night
Give me just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (Ooh-ooh-hoo)
Please give me one more night
Ooh, just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (Ooh-ooh-hoo)
Give me one more night
Give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (Ooh-ooh-hoo)

[Bridge]
Like a river to the sea
I will always be with you
And if you sail away
I will follow you

[Chorus]
Give me one more night
Give me just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (Ooh-ooh-hoo)
[Verse 3]
I know there'll never be a time you'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind, you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

[Chorus]
Give me just one more night
Give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (Ooh-ooh-hoo)
Give me just one more night
Give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (Ooh-ooh-hoo)

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo)
(Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo)
(Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo)
(Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo)
(Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo)
(Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo)
(Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo)
(Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hooâ€¦)
