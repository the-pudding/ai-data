[Verse 1]
Never met a girl could make me feel
The way that you do, you're alright
Whenever I'm asked what makes my dreams real
I tell 'em you do, you're outta' sight

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, twiddley dee, twiddley dum
Look out, baby, 'cause here I come

[Chorus]
I'm bringing you a love that's true (get ready)
Get ready, (get ready)
I'll start makin' love to you (get ready)
Get ready, (get ready)
Oh, don't you know I'm comin'? (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
On my way (Get ready, 'cause here I come)

[Verse 2]
You wanna' play hide and seek with love
Let me remind you, you're alright
Lovin' you're gonna' miss
And the time it takes to find you, you're outta' sight

Look out, baby, now here I come

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, if all of my friends should want you too
I think I'll understand,  you're alright
Hope I get to you before they do
'Cause that's how I planned it, you're outta' sight
