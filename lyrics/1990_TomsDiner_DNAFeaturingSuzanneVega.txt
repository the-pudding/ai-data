[Verse 1: Suzanne Vega]
I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
He is looking out the window at somebody coming in

[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

"It is always nice to see you," says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in, she is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them and instead I pour the milk

[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 3: Suzanne Vega]
I open up the paper, there's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking, it was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope and looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me and so I raise my head

[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
[Verse 4: Suzanne Vega]
There's a woman on the outside looking inside, does she see me?
No, she does not really see me 'cause she sees her own reflection
And I'm trying not to notice that she's hitching up her skirt
And while she's straightening her stockings, her hair has gotten wet

[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 5: Suzanne Vega]
Oh, this rain, it will continue through the morning as I'm listening
To the bells of the cathedral
I am thinking of your voice

[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-dooEmbed
