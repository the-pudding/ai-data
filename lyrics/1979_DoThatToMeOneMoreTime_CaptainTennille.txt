Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, kiss me like you just did
Oh baby
Do that to me once again

[Chorus]
Pass that by me one more time
Once just isn't enough for my heart to hear
Oh, tell it to me one more time
I can never hear enough while I've got you near, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Say those words again like you just did
Oh baby
Tell it to me once again

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Woah, do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]

Oh baby
Do that to me once again

[Bridge]
Oh baby
Do that to me once again
Oh baby
Do that to me one more time

[Outro]
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more timeEmbed
