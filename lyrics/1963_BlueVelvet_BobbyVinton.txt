Blue velvet, woah-woah

[Verse 1]
She wore blue velvet (Woah-woah)
Bluer than velvet was the night (Woah-woah-woah)
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

[Verse 2]
She wore blue velvet (Woah-woah)
Bluer than velvet were her eyes (Woah-woah-woah)
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours, a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of

[Verse 3]
Blue velvet (Woah-woah)
But in my heart there'll always be (Woah-woah-woah)
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

But in my heart there'll always be (Woah-woah-woah)
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears
