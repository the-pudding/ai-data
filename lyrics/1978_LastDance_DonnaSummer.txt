Last dance
Last chance for love
Yes, it's my last chance
For romance tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you by me
Beside me to guide me
To hold me
To scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so, so bad

[Chorus]
So, let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance
Let's dance this last dance tonight

[Verse]
Last dance
Last chance for love
Yes, it's my last chance
For romance tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I need you by me
Beside me to guide me
To hold me
To scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so, so bad

All that I ask is that you dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you by me
Beside me to guide me
To hold me
