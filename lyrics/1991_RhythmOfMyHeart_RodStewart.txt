Across the street, the river runs
Down in the gutter, life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running under cover of a helicopter blade

[Verse 2]
Flames are getting higher in effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, someway
Where they're downing only deer, a hundred steel towns away

[Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

[Verse 3]
Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness, light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

I'll be sailing
I'll be sailing
I will

[Bridge]
Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yanking back the handle, no expression on my face

[Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

[Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

[Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailingEmbed
