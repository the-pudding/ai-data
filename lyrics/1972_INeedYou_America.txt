10 ContributorsI Need You Lyrics[Verse 1]
We used to laugh
We used to cry
We used to bow our heads then
Wonder why
But now you're gone
I guess I'll carry on
And make the best of what you left to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Left to me, left to me

[Chorus]
I need you
Like the flower needs the rain
You know, I need you
Guess I'll start it all again
You know, I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know, I need you
I need you

[Verse 2]
And every day
I'd laugh the hours away
Just knowin' you were thinkin' of me
Then it came
That I was put to blame
For every story told about me

About me, about me

[Chorus]
I need you
Like the flower needs the rain
You know, I need you
Guess I'll start it all again
You know, I need you
I need you
I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know, I need you
Guess I'll start it all again
You know, I need you
I need you

[Chorus]
I need you
Like the flower needs the rain
You know, I need you
Guess I'll start it all again
You know, I need you
I need you
I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know, I need you
[Outro]
Guess I'll start it all again
You know, I need youEmbed
