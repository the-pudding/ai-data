20 ContributorsI Knew I Loved You Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm
Ooh, oh

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant
And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that it might sound more than a little
Crazy, but I believe...

[Chorus]
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

[Verse 2]
There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces (I'm searching for)
I think I found my way home
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know that it might sound more than a little
Crazy, but I believe...

[Chorus]
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
A thousand angels dance around you
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
I am complete now that I've found you

[Chorus]
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into my life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
[Outro]
I knew I loved you before I met you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
I knew I loved you
I knew I loved you before I met you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
I knew I loved you
I knew I loved you before I met you (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I knew I loved you before I met you (Yeah, yeah, oh)
I knew I loved you7Embed
