5 ContributorsDown by the Lazy River Lyrics[Verse 1]
What're you doin' tonight?
You got no place to go
Gotta get out of the city
Why don't you come along with me?
Mighty fine out tonight
Get your girl and hold her tight
We can take it nice and easy
You know it won't be long
'Til we'll be, we'll be

[Chorus]
Down by the lazy river, come as you please
Down by the lazy river, one big family
If you're all alone, you won't be long
Just bring your guitar and sing your song
Down by the lazy river, everybody follow me

[Verse 2]
Better make up your mind
Get the show on the road
We're gonna have a party
Come along or you'll be sorry, sorry
You know there's plenty of room
Come on, sing a-boom-boom-boom
We can get nice and cozy
Why don't you come along and mosey
You might also like[Bridge]
On down, I said, down
Come on down, I'm going

[Chorus]
Down by the lazy river, come as you please
Down by the lazy river, one big family
If you're all alone, you won't be long
Just bring your guitar and sing your song
Down by the lazy river, everybody follow me

[Alt. Chorus]
If you're all alone, you won't be long
Just bring your guitar and sing your song
Down by the lazy river, down

[Outro]
I'm going down by the lazy river, down
I'm going down by the lazy river, down
I'm going down by the lazy river, down
I'm going down by the lazy river, down...Embed
