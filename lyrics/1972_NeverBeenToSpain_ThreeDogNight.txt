13 ContributorsNever Been to Spain Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it

[Chorus 1]
They don't abuse it
Never gonna lose it
I can't refuse it

[Verse 2]
Well, I've never been to England
But I kinda like the Beatles
Well, I headed for Las Vegas
Only made it out to Needles

[Chorus 2]
Can you feel it?
Must be near it
Feels so good
Oh, it feels so good

[Verse 3]
Well, I've never been to heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
Oh, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember

In Oklahoma, not Arizona
What does it matter?
What does it matter?

[Verse 1]
Oh, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it

[Chorus 1]
They don't abuse it
Never gonna lose it
I can't refuse it, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Well, I've never been to heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
Well, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember

[Chorus 3]
In Oklahoma, not Arizona
What does it matter?
What does it matter?2Embed
