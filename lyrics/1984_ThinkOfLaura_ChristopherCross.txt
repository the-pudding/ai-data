8 ContributorsThink of Laura Lyrics[Intro]
Hey Laura, Laura
Hey Laura, Laura

[Verse 1]
Every once in a while
I'd see her smile
And she'd turn my day around
A girl with those eyes could stare through the lies
And see what your heart was saying

[Chorus]
Think of Laura
But laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
When you think of Laura
Laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way

[Verse 2]
A friend of a friend
A friend 'til the end
That's the kind of girl she was
Taken away so young
Taken away without a warning

Think of Laura
But laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
When you think of Laura
Laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way

[Verse 3]
I know you and you're here
In every day we live
I know her and well, she's here
I can feel her when I sing

[Bridge]
Hey Laura, where are you now?
Are you far away from here?
I don't think so
I think you're here taking our tears away

[Chorus]
Think of Laura
But laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
When you think of Laura
Laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that wayEmbed
