2 ContributorsGirls Nite Out LyricsGet up!
Ow!
Na, na, na, na, na, na

We're sick and tired of being left at home
While the boys go out and leave us all alone.  Yeah
I wanna go out with my girlfriends and party all night
And this time you won't change my mind
'Cause I've got my mind made up
So don't wait up for me

It's the girls' nite out, na, na, nite out
And there's nothing you can say, baby
It's the girls' nite to play, our nite to play
So don't wait up for me

Na, na, na, na, na, na

We're stepping out and we're leaving our troubles behind
Yeah, oh yeah
I've got the girls and we've only got one thing on our mind
(Where are we going tonight?) Oh, oh
The time is right, so are you ready to party all night?
And this time I'm leaving you behind
'Cause I've got my mind made up
So don't wait up for me
