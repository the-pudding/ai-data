5 ContributorsSugar Town Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got some troubles, but they won't last
I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass
And pretty soon, all my troubles will pass
'Cause I'm in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, Sugar Town

[Verse 2]
I never had a dog that liked me some
Never had a friend or wanted one
So I just lay back and laugh at the sun
'Cause I'm in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, Sugar Town

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Yesterday, it rained in Tennessee
I heard it also rained in Tallahassee
But not a drop fell on little old me
'Cause I was in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, Sugar Town

[Verse 4]
If I had a million dollars or ten
I'd give to you, world, and then
You'd go away and let me spend
My life in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, Sugar Town
