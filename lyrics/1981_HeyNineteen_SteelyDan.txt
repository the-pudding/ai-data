60 ContributorsHey Nineteen Lyrics[Verse 1]
Way back when, in '67
I was the dandy of Gamma Chi
Sweet things from Boston
So young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale
Where the hell am I?

[Chorus]
Hey Nineteen
No, we can't dance together
(We can’t dance together)
No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down

[Verse 2]
Hey Nineteen
That's 'Retha Franklin
She don't remember the Queen of Soul
It’s hard times befallen
The sole survivors
She thinks I'm crazy
But I'm just growing old

[Chorus]
Hey Nineteen
No, we got nothing in common
(We can’t dance together)
No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down
You might also like[Interlude]
Nice!
Sure looks good!
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Skate a little lower, now

[Bridge]
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
(Say it again)
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing

[Chorus]
No, we can't dance together
No, we can't talk at all4Embed
