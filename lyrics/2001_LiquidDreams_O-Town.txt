17 ContributorsLiquid Dreams Lyrics[Intro]
Posters of love surrounding me, lost in a world of fantasy
Every night she comes to me and gives me all the love I need

[Pre-Chorus]
Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine
And she's so fine designed to blow your mind
She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen

[Chorus]
I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch of Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile, rolled in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams

[Verse 2]
Angelina Jolie's lips to kiss in the dark
Underneath Cindy C's beauty mark
When it comes to the test well Tyra's the best
And Salma Hayek brings the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine
And she's so fine designed to blow your mind
She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen
You might also like[Chorus]
I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch of Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile, rolled in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams

[Verse 3]
Looks ain't everything she's got the sweetest personality
Like Halle B
My mama thinks I'm lazy, my friends all think I'm crazy
But in my mind, I leave the world, oh
(World behind every night I dream)

[Bridge]
Liquid Dreams, my Liquid Dreams
Waterfalls and streams, these liquid dreams

[Chorus]
I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch of Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile, rolled in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams

[Outro]
My liquid dreams
My liquid dreams
