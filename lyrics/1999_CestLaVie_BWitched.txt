"Some people say I look like me dad"
"What? Are you serious?"

[Verse 1]
I say, hey boy, sittin' in your tree
Mummy always wants you to come for tea (Uh-oh)
Don't be shy, straighten up your tie
Get down from your treehouse sittin' in the sky (Uh-oh)
I wanna know just what to do
Is it very big? Is there room for two? (Uh-oh)
I got a house with windows and doors
I'll show you mine if you show me yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey
Let the fun begin, hey
I'm the wolf today, hey, hey, hey
I'll huff, I'll puff
I'll huff, I'll puff, I'll blow you away

[Chorus]
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me
C'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me (Get a life!)
C'est la vie

Do you play with the girls, play with the boys?
Do you ever get lonely playing with your toys? (Uh-oh)
We can talk, we can sing
I'll be the queen and you'll be the king (Uh-oh)
Hey boy, in your tree
Throw down your ladder, make a room for me (Uh-oh)
I got a house with windows and doors
I'll show you mine if you show me yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey
Let the fun begin, hey
I'm the wolf today, hey, hey, hey
I'll huff, I'll puff
I'll huff, I'll puff, I'll blow you away

[Chorus]
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me (Say you will, yeah)
C'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't (Oh, say you will)
Say you'll do what I don't (Say you will)
Say you're true, say to me (What are you like?)
C'est la vie
[Bridge]
Huh, huh
Na-na-nah, hey
Na-na-nah, oh
Na-na-nah, hey
Huh, huh, huh, huh

[Chorus]
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't (Say you will)
Say you're true, say to me
Wanna say, c'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me (Say you will)
C'est la vie (Fight like me dad as well!)

[Outro]
Na-na-nah oh (C'est la vie)
Na-na-nah, hey
Huh, huh, huh, huh (C'est la vie)1Embed
