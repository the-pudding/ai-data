You know our love was meant to be
The kind of love that lasts forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart
In my soul, baby

[Chorus: All]
You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
"No one needs you more than I need you"

[Verse 2: Peter Cetera]
And I know, yes, I know that it's plain to see
So in love when we're together
Now I know (Now I know)
That I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know  (Yes, you need to know)
Everywhere I go
You're always on my mind, you're in my heart
In my soul
