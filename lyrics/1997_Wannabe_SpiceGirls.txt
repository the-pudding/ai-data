If you wanna get with me
Better make it fast
Now, don't go wasting
My precious time
Get your act together, we could be just fine

So tell me what you want
What you really, really want
I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!)
I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!)
I wanna really, really, really wanna "zig-a-zig", ah

I'll give you a try
If you really bug me, then I'll say goodbye

Slam your body down and wind it all around

Make it last forever (Slam, slam, slam)
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around

Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and "zig-a-zig", ah
