26 ContributorsWichita Lineman Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload

[Chorus]
I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

[Chorus]
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
