When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say, "Live and let live"
(You know you did
You know you did
You know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we're livin'
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney]
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude: Paul McCartney]
What does it matter to ya?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You gotta give the other fella hell!

[Verse: Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney]
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did
You know you did
You know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we're livin'
Makes you give in and cry
You might also like[Chorus: Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney]
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)5Embed
