2 Contributors(Down at) Papa Joe’s LyricsSay, there's a place in New Orleans
That serves fried chicken with turnip greens
Crawfish bisque that'll treat you right
And Papa Joe plays there every night

A little dark haired beauty says "Step right in"
And you can bet a full dollar she's be yo' friend
And everybody there has a toler'ble time
Down at Papa Joe's

Papa Joe's got a swingin' band
You can rock and roll to Dixieland
The customers knows it's the place to go
Down at Papa Joe's

A little waitress comes to set you down
She's got the best frog legs in town
There's a welcome sign hangin' on the door
So don't you be afraid to ask for more

Now the only time Joe's closed at night
Is when the Police come and turns out the light
They get a little mad 'cause they don't fight
Down at Papa Joe's

It's thicker than fleas on a monkey's back
But the folks down there, they like it like that
They live it up and they all come back
Down at Papa Joe'sYou might also likeEmbed
