I don't want to hear it
No more fussin' and a-fightin', baby
Hold me tight
Let's let bygones be bygones
Let's think about tomorrow, girl
Our future's bright

[Chorus]
Well, I know I was wrong
But I was just a fool
Too blind to see
You were the only girl for me
Ah, but now I see the light
And everything's gonna be all right
Baby, hold me tight

[Refrain]
Baba, baba-ba-baba-ba
Baba, baba-ba-baba-ba
Baba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Baba, baba-ba-baba-ba
Baba, baba-ba-baba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba

[Chorus]
Well, I know I was wrong
But, I was just a fool
Too blind to see
You were the only girl for me
Ah, but now I see the light
And everything's gonna be all right
Baby, hold me tight

You will always be my baby

[Refrain]
Baba, baba-ba-baba-ba
Baba, baba-ba-baba-ba
Baba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba

Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
