10 ContributorsInside Your Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation comin' around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you, I'm alive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight (Light)
All my dreams are in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

[Verse 2]
When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone (Done)

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

[Bridge]
When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away

[Chorus]
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from (Wanna be inside)
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven1Embed
