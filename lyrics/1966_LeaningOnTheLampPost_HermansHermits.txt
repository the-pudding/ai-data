4 ContributorsLeaning on the Lamp Post LyricsI'm leaning on the lamp
Maybe you think I look a tramp
Or maybe you think I'm 'round to steal a car
But no, I'm not a crook
And if you think that's what I look
I'll tell you why and what my motives are

I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by
Oh me, oh my
I hope that little lady comes by

She's wonderful, she's marvelous
She's fabulous, she's beautiful
And anyone can understand why
I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by

She doesn't always get away
She cannot always get away
But anyway I know that she'll try
Oh me, oh my
I hope that little lady comes by

She's not the kind of girl to be late for
But this girl I'd break any date for
I won't have to ask what she's late for
She'd never leave me flat
She's not a girl like that

I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by

I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by
Oh me, oh my
I hope that little lady comes by

Oh, she's wonderful, she's marvelous
She's fabulous, she's beautiful
