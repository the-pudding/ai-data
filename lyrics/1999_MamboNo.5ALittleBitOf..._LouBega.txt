Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number 5

[Verse 1]
One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna beer-bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue, you know they gettin' sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me, flirtin' is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Mambo Number 5 (Ha)

[Verse 2]
Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound, put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doin' it right

[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)

[Bridge]
(Ha) Trumpet
The trumpet
Mambo Number 5
Ha-ha-ha
[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ooh)

[Outro]
I do all to
Fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky
Mambo Number 5 (Ha)14Embed
