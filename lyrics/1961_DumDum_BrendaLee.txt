2 ContributorsDum Dum Lyrics[Intro]
(Da-da, da-da, da-da-da)

[Chorus]
A-dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, uh-huh-huh
A-dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, oh yeah
Dum-dum, a-diddly-dum

[Verse 1]
Ah, music's sweet, the lights are low
Playin' a song on the radio
Your ma's in the kitchen, your pa's next door
I wanna love you just a little bit more

[Chorus]
Singin', dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, uh-huh
Dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, sing it out
Dum-dum, a-diddly-dum

[Verse 2]
Come on, baby, don't you be so shy
You know that I love you, let me tell you why
You got a heart, I know that it's true
I couldn't love you any more than I do

[Chorus]
Singin' dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, whoa yeah
Dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, one more time
Dum-dum, a-diddly-dum

[Verse 3]
Ah, I want you with me all of the time
Tell me you love me, and you'll be mine
There's so many things that we could do, ah
So say the words and make my dreams come true

[Chorus]
Singin' dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, uh-huh
A-dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, sing it out
Dum-dum, a-diddly-dum

[Outro]
A-dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, sing it out
Dum-dum, a-diddly-dum, I can't hear you
Dum-dum, a-diddly-dumEmbed
