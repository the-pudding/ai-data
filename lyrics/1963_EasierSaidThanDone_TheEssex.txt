5 ContributorsEasier Said Than Done Lyrics[Verse 1]
My friends all tell me
Go to him, run to him
Say sweet lovely things to him
And tell him, he's the one

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart I know it
But it's so hard to show it
'Cause it's easier, easier said than done

[Verse 2]
My buddies tell me
Fly to him, sigh to him (Fly)
Tell him I would die for him (Sigh, sign)
And tell him, he's the one

[Chorus]
Although he gives me a feeling
That sets my heart a-reeling
Yet it's easier, easier said than done

[Bridge]
Well, I know (I know) that I love him so
But I'm afraid that he'll never know
Because I (I-I), I get so timid and shy
Each time that I look him in the eye
You might also like[Verse 3]
They all tell me
Sing to him, swing with him (Sing, sing)
And just do anything for him (Swing, swing)
And tell him, he's the one

[Chorus]
I got a love so true
And yet I'm sad and blue
'Cause it's easier, easier said than done

[Bridge]
Well, I know (I know) that I love him so
But I'm afraid that he'll never know
Because I (I-I), I get so timid and shy
Each time that I look him in the eye

[Verse 3]
They all tell me
Sing to him, swing with him (Sing, sing)
And just do anything for him (Swing, swing)
And tell him, he's the one

[Chorus]
I've got a love so true
And yet I'm sad and blue
'Cause it's easier, easier said than done
Easier-er-er-er, said than doneEmbed
