6 ContributorsYouâ€™re In Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Open the door and come in
I'm so glad to see you, my friend
I don't know how long it has been
Having those feelings again

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I see that you're so happy
And ooh, it just sets me free
And I'd like to see us as good of friends
As we used to be
Ah-ah-ah, my love
Ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
You're in love, that's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love, and I know
That you're not in love with me
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that you're in love
Now I'll let you go 'cause I know that you're in love

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That you're never coming back for me
I've had this dream that you'd always be by my side
Oh, I could've died

But now I see that you're so happy (See that you're so happy)

And I'd like to see us as good of friends
As we used to be

Ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
You're in love (You're in love), that's the way (That's the way) it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love (You're in love), and I know (And I know)
That you're not in love with me
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that you're in love
I can let you go 'cause I know that you're in love

[Bridge]
I tried to find you, but you were so far away
I was praying that fate would bring you back to me
Someday, someday, someday, someday
Ooh, you're in love

[Outro]
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that you're in love
Now I'll let you go 'cause I know that you're in love, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, oohEmbed
