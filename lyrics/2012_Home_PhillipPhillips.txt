Hold on, to me as we go
As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave (Wave) is stringing us along
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

[Pre-Chorus]
Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble, it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found

[Chorus]
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh-ahh-ahh
Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh, ahh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found
You might also like[Chorus]
Just know you're not alone
