35 ContributorsParty All the Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, I can't understand it, why you want to hurt me
After all of the things I've done for you
I buy you champagne and roses, put diamonds on your finger
(Diamonds on your finger)
And still, you hang out all night
What am I to do?

[Chorus]
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time
She parties all the time

[Post-Chorus: Rick James]
(Party all the time)
She likes to party all the time
(Party all the time)
(Party all the time)
She likes to party all the time
(Party all the time)

[Verse 2]
Girl, I've seen you in clubs just hanging out and dancing
You give your number to every man you see
You never come home at night because you're out romancing
I wish you'd bring some of your love home to me
You might also like[Chorus]
But my girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time, yeah

[Bridge: Rick James]
(Party, party)
She likes to party all the time
(Party, party, party, party, party)

[Outro: Rick James]
She likes to party all the time, yeah
She lets her hair down
She likes to party down
She likes to party
She likes to party down
(Party all the time)
Oh, now get down and party, yeah
(Party all the time)
(Party all the time)9Embed
