12 ContributorsBernadette Lyrics[Chorus]
Bernadette, people are searching for
The kind of love that we possessed (Bernadette)
Some go on searching their whole life through
And never find the love I've found in you

[Verse 1]
And when I speak of you, I see envy in other men's eyes
And I'm well aware of what's on their minds (Ah, don't you know?)
They pretend to be my friend, when all the time (Sweet Bernadette)
They long to persuade you from my side (Sweet Bernadette)
They'd give the world and all they own
For just one moment we have known

[Chorus]
Bernadette, they want you because
Of the pride that it gives
But Bernadette, I want you because
I need you to live

[Verse 2]
But while I live only to hold you
Some other men, they long to control you (Ah, don't you know?)
But how can they control you, Bernadette? (Sweet Bernadette)
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette? (Sweet Bernadette)
From wanting you, needing you

But darling, you belong to me (Bernadette)
I'll tell the world, you belong to me
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me (Bernadette)
I'll tell the world, you're a part of me
Bernadette

[Bridge]
In your arms, I find the kind of peace of mind
The world is searching for
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine
Has always been longing for

[Verse 3]
In you I have what other men long for
All men need someone to worship and adore (Ah, don't you know?)
That's why I treasure you and place you high above (Sweet Bernadette)
For the only joy in life is to be loved (Sweet Bernadette)
So whatever you do, Bernadette

[Chorus]
Keep on loving me (Bernadette)
Bernadette, keep on needing me
Bernadette

[Outro]
Bernadette (Bernadette)
You're the soul of me
More than a dream, you're a plan to me
And Bernadette, you mean more to me
Than a woman was ever meant to be
Bernadette, my darling Bernadette2Embed
