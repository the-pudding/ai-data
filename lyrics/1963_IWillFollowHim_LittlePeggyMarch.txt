13 ContributorsI Will Follow Him Lyrics[Intro]
I love him, I love him, I love him
And where He goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow

[Verse 1]
I will follow him
Follow him, wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep me away

[Verse 2]
I must follow him
Ever since he touched my hand I knew
That near him I always must be
And nothing can keep him from me
He is my destiny

[Chorus]
I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
He'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love
From now until forever, forever, forever

[Verse 1]
I will follow him
Follow him, wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep, keep me away
Away from my love

I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
He'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love
From now until forever, forever, forever

[Verse 1]
I will follow him
Follow him, wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep, keep me away
Away from my love

[Outro]
And where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
I know I'll always love him1Embed
