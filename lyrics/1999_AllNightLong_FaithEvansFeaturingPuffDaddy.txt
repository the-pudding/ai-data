5 ContributorsAll Night Long Lyrics[Intro: Puffy]
I like this right here, yeah
Bad Boy, and we won't stop
Faith, '99

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
We can dance, dance, dance (all)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (night)
All night long
If you're in the mood (all)
Do what you wanna do (night)
All night long

[Verse 1: Faith Evans]
Happy days are here
So leave your cares behind
Just relax your mind
It's so easy to do it

[Pre-Chorus: Faith Evans]
Just enjoy  yourself
If the feeling's right
Get your groove on tonight
Take your time tonight
Everything's all right
Ain't nothing but a party
You might also like[Chorus: Faith Evans]
We can dance, dance, dance (all)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (night)
All night long
If you're in the mood (all)
Do what you wanna do (night)
All night long

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
Get up on the floor
Don't worry 'bout a thing
The rhythm's got you now
So come on, get into it

[Pre-Chorus: Faith Evans]
Just enjoy yourself
If the feeling's right
Get your groove on tonight
Take your time tonight
Everything's all right
Ain't nothing but a party

We can dance, dance, dance (all)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (night)

[Bridge: Faith Evans]
Have a good time
Lay back, relax
Just free your mind
Let the music take control of you

[Verse 3: Puffy and (Faith Evans)]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If it's a hot then I must've did it
If it's not then I wasn't with it
Bad Boy stay committed
Whether hip-hop or R&B
Featuring Faith Evans, co-starring me, P. Diddy
You know I got the key to your city
Unlock the door, rock some more
Beats we lace
Bad Boy heat the place
We run R&B too cuz we keep the faith
Givin the streets a taste
Blaze the charts (I remember)
In case you forgot
First Lady B making it hot
Ain't nobody taking the spot
Now it's Faith instead of pain
Coming through with a better grain
In the dash, cell phone better range
Get the cash, and stock paper for the whole four quarters
Damn, some things never change
Ya feel me? Let's make 'em dance
Let's go
[Chorus: Faith Evans]
We can dance, dance, dance (all)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (night)
All night long
If you're in the mood (all)
Do what you wanna do (night)
All night long

[Bridge: Faith Evans]
Have a good time
Lay back, relax
Just free your mind
Let the music take control of you

[Chorus (repeated until fade): Faith Evans]
We can dance, dance, dance (all)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (night)
All night long
If you're in the mood (all)
Do what you wanna do (night)
All night longEmbed
