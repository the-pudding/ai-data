I said "Go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay"
I didn't care if you hung around me, I didn't care if you went away
And I know you were never right, I'll admit, I was never wrong
I could never make up my mind, I made it up as I went along

[Pre-Chorus]
And though I treated you like a child
I'm gonna miss you for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you

[Verse 2]
I never had any time, and I never had any call
But I went out of my way just to hurt you, the one I shouldn't hurt at all
I thought I was being cool, yeah, I thought I was being strong
But it's always the same old story, you never know what you've got 'til it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
If I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

[Chorus]
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

[Chorus]
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)

[Outro]
All I need is a miracle (All I need is a, all I need is a, all I need is you), all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle (All I need), all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle (All I need is a miracle), all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)1Embed
