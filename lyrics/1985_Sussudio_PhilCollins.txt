There's a girl that's been on my mind
All the time
Su-sussudio, oh-oh
Now, she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
Su-sussudio, woah-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere
She's all I need, all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word

[Chorus]
Su-sussudio
Just say the word, oh, su-sussudio

[Verse 2]
Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun
Su-sussudio, oh, oh
Ooh, give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime
Su-su-s-sussudio, oh, oh

Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer, but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
I feel so good if I just say the word

[Chorus]
Su-sussudio
Just say the word, oh, s-s-su-s-s-sussudio, oh

[Horns Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, she's all I need, all of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word

[Chorus]
Su-sussudio
I just say the word, oh, su-su-s-sussudio
I just say the word, oh, su-sussudio
I'll say the word, oh, s-s-su-s-s-sussudio, oh, oh, oh
