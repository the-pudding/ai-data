Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me, oh so tight
Show me that you love me, too

[Verse 2]
Put your lips next to mine, dear
Won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in love
(You and I will fall in love)

[Bridge]
People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way, I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in

[Verse 3]
Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me, tell me that you love me, too
(Tell me that you love me, too)
