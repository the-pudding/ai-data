14 ContributorsIâ€™m a Man Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, my pad is very messy
And there's whiskers on my chin
And I'm all hung up on music
And I always play to win
I ain't got no time for lovin'
'Cause my time is all used up
Just to sit around creatin'
All that groovy kind of stuff

[Chorus]
But I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
No, no, no, but I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so

[Verse 2]
Well, if I had my choice of matter
I would rather be with cats
All engrossed in mental chatter
Goin' where our minds are at
And relating to each other
Just how strong our wills can be
In resisting all involvement
With each groovy chick we see
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
No, no, no, but I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
No, let me tell you, now, I said

[Verse 3]
I got to keep my image
While suspended from a throne
That looks out upon a kingdom
With people all unknown
Who imagine I'm not human
And my heart is made of stone
And I've never had no problems
And my toilet's trimmed with chrome

[Chorus]
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
No, no, no (Yes I am)
No, no, no (Keep it so, baby)
Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey)
Yes I know (Oh, hey, hey)
[Outro]
Yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know...2Embed
