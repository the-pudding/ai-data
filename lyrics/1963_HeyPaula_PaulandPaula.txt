Hey, hey, Paula
I wanna marry you
Hey, hey Paula
No one else could ever do
I've waited so long for school to be through
Paula, I can't wait no more for you
My love, my love

[Chorus: Ray Hildebrand & Jill Jackson]
True love means planning a life for two
Being together the whole day through
True love means waiting and hoping that soon
Wishes we made will come true
My love, my love

[Verse 2: Jill Jackson]
Hey, Paul
I've been waiting for you
Hey, hey, hey Paul
I want to marry you, too
If you love me true, if you love me still
Our love will always be real
My love, my love

[Chorus: Ray Hildebrand & Jill Jackson]
True love means planning a life for two
Being together the whole day through
True love means waiting and hoping that soon
Wishes we made will come true
My love, my loveYou might also likeEmbed
