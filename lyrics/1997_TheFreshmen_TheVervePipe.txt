34 ContributorsThe Freshmen Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was young, I knew everything
And she, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin', with my head on the floor
Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't be held responsible
'Cause was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

[Chorus]
For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen

[Verse 2]
My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin', with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said

[Pre-Chorus]
"Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place"

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen

[Post-Chorus]
Hey-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey-yeah
Hey-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
We tried to wash our hands of all of this
We'd never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt-stricken, sobbin', with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say

[Pre-Chorus]
"Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place"

[Chorus]
For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen
For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen
[Outro]
We were merely freshmen
We were only freshmen13Embed
