Mmm, I bet you're wondering how I knew
Baby, baby, baby, about your plans to make me blue (How)
With some other girl you knew before
Between the two of us girls, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

[Chorus: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
(Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer would you be mine
(Not much longer would you be mine)
Oh, don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
(Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
And I'm just about, just about, just about to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am
(Oh yes, I am; oh, yes, I am; oh, yes, I am)
Baby, won't you listen to me

[Verse 2: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
Boy, take a good look at these tears of mine
Baby, baby, these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could've told me yourself
That you love somebody else
You might also like[Chorus: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
(Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
Oh, not much longer you be mine
(Not much longer would you be mine)
Don't you know that I heard it (Heard it)
Yes, I heard it (Heard it through the grapevine)
Oh, just about, just about, just about to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am
(Oh yes, I am; oh, yes, I am; oh, yes, I am)

[Bridge: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
Go-o-o-o-o, go
Go, I gotta go
Whoa, whoa, if you gonna let me go
Whoa-whoa-whoa, I gotta go
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I gotta go

[Verse 3: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
Say believe half of what you see (Yes, I heard it)
Oh, ho, and none of what you hear (Yes, I heard it)
Baby, but I just can't help being confused (Yes, I heard it)
If it's true please baby, won't you tell me, dear (Yes, I heard it)
Oh, do you plan to let me go?
For the other girl you loved before?
[Chorus: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
Don't you know that I heard through the grapevine
(Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer you be mine
(Not much longer would you be mine)
Don't you know that I heard it (Heard it)
Yes, I heard it (Heard it through the grapevine)
Oh, I heard it (Heard it)
Heard it (Heard it, heard it through the grapevine)1Embed
