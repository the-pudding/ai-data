4 ContributorsIs It Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I say I love you, I hold you near me
You say I scare you, well that's your fear
I know the message my heart is sending
But you don't read it, you keep me guessing

[Chorus]
Is it love, is it love you're after
Is it love, is it, is it love

[Verse 2]
The broken record goes round and round
Within a circle, without a sound
I'm under water, in overdrive
You hide in laughter, what's on your mind?

[Chorus]
Is it love, is it love you're after
(Why don't you tell me?)
Is it love, is it, is it love
Is it love, is it love you're after
(Why can't you tell me?)
Is it love, is it really love

[Guitar solo]

Is it love, is it love you're after
(Why can't you tell me?)
Is it love, is it, is it love
Is it love, is it love you're after
(Hey girl, I got to know, is it really, really love)
Is it love, is it really love
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey)
Is it love, is it love you're after
(Why don't you tell me?)
Is it love, is it really love
Is it love, is it love you're after
(Everybody's lookin' for the perfect love to come along and hope we'll find it)
Is it love, is it really love
Is it love, is it love you're after
(Why don't you tell me?)Embed
