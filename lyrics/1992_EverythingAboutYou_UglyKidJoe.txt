18 ContributorsEverything About You Lyrics[Intro: Julia Sweeney]
Are you those guys on the beach that hate everything?
Eww! Is this some sort of hip music that I don't understand?

[Verse 1]
I hate the rain and sunny weather
And I, I hate the beach and mountains too, boo-hoo
And I don't like a thing about the city, no, no
And I, I, I, hate the countryside too!

[Chorus]
And I, hate everything about you
Everything about you

[Verse 2]
And I don't like a thing about your mother
And I, I hate your daddy's guts too, boo-hoo
And I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no
'Cause I, I, I think sex is overrated too

[Chorus]
And I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you
You might also like[Bridge]
Some say I've got a bad attitude
But that don't change the way I feel about you
And if you think this might be bringing me down
Look again 'cause I ain't wearing no frown
Get down!

[Verse 3]
Well, I don't really care about your sister
Fuck the little bitch, 'cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
I put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe

Well, I know, you know, everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it's gonna go
You think it's sad
Well, that's too bad
'Cause I'm havin' a ball
Hatin' every little thing about you, ha-ha!

[Chorus]
Everything about you, everything about
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around

[Pre-Outro]
I hate everything about
You!
