This a Nitti beat
Yeah, here we go again (Boing)
Bad boy south, Ghettoville U.S.A. (Bloc Entertainment)
You know I go by the name Nitti, right? (Yeah, uh-huh)
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker out my squad, right (Yeah, yeah, who this nigga, man?)
This nigga go by the name of Joc (Joc?, Yung Joc, yeah)
He resides in Collegepark (Collegepark, C.P.)
But for right now, what we gotta do for y'all (What we gonna do?, yeah)
We gotta give y'all a hit (Huh)

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Niggas in my face (Ayy), damn near er' day (Ayy)
Ask a million questions like, "Joc, where ya' stay?" (Stay)
Tell 'em Collegepark (Park), where they chop cars (Cars)
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar (Uh)
Just bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass (Yeah), with the bucket seats (Uh-huh)
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks (Yeah)
Catch me in the hood (Yeah), posted at the store (Store)
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough (Yeah)
If your girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain (Hop on, hop on)
Er'body love me, I'm so fly (Fly)
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know you wonder why I'm so cool (Why, cool, yeah)
Don't ask me, just do what you do (Okay, okay)

Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere you meet me, guaranteed to go down
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere you meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
Verse number two (Ayy), do the damn thing (Ayy, uh-huh)
Cubes on my neck, pockets full of Ben Frank's (Frank's, uh-huh)
When I'm in the mall (Mall), hoes just pause (Pause)
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall (Uh)
Time to flip the work, make the block bump (Bump)
Boys in the hood call me black Donald Trump (Haha)
Dope boy magic (Yeah), seven days a week (Uh-huh, seven days)
Number one record 'long as Nitti on the beat (Yeah)
Ooh, I think they like me, better yet, I know (Know)
Lights, camera, action, when I walk through the door (Door)
Niggas know my crew (Crew), we certified stars (Stars)
Valet in the front, 'bout thirty-five cars (Thirty-five cars, hop on)
Bitches in the back, black Beamer coupe's (I like that)
Girls liking girls (Girls), time to recruit (Recruit, yeah)
If you got a problem, say it to my face (Yeah, my face)
We can knuckle up any time, any place (Okay, okay)
[Chorus: Yung Joc]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Time to set it off (Ayy), let these niggas know (Uh-huh)
Have ya ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors? (Yeah, uh-huh)
I ride real slow (Slow), no need to speed (Nope)
Gotta make sure you see the buckets on my feet (Uh, on my feet)
Feds on my trail, but they don't think I know (Know)
I keep my hands clean 'cause I never touch dope (Touch dope)
Every time I see 'em (See' em), look 'em in they eyes (They eyes)
Ask me how I know (Huh), it's me, surprise (Yeah)
Put it in the air (Yeah), rep where you stay (Way)
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face (Face, yeah, uh-huh)
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'ma make it rain nigga, I ain't scared to share it (What? Hop on, hop on)

[Chorus: Yung Joc & Nitti]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down (Yeah, yeah)
