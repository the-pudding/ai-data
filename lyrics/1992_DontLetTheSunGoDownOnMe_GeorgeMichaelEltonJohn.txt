20 ContributorsDonâ€™t Let the Sun Go Down on Me Lyrics[Verse 1: George Michael]
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2: George Michael]
It's much too late to save myself from fallin'
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus: George Michael]
Don't let the sun go down on me, yeah
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John

[Verse 3: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me (Baby, no)
Just because you think I mean you harm
(Just because you think I mean you harm, no)
But these cuts I have (Cuts I have)
They need love (They need love, they need love)
To help them heal, oh
You might also like[Chorus: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
'Cause losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Chorus: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see, yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby, oh
'Cause losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Outro: George Michael]
Mr. Elton John1Embed
