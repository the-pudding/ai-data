Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
There's nothing left of me?

[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

[Verse 2]
As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet
You might also like[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper (Ah, ah)
Like a skyscraper (Ah, ah)

[Bridge]
Go run, run, run, I'm gonna stay right here (Here)
Watch you disappear (-Pear), yeah, oh
Go run, run, run, yeah, it's a long way down (Down)
But I am closer to the clouds up here

[Chorus]
You can take everything I have (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You can break everything I am (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Like I'm made of glass (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Like I'm made of paper, oh, oh (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper (Ah, ah, ah)
Like a skyscraper (Ah, ah, ah)
[Outro]
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper31Embed
