5 ContributorsThe Wanderer Lyrics[Verse 1:]
Woke up this morning
Dragged myself across the bed
Alice went to Wonderland
But I stayed home instead
I started feeling bad
Cause I was left behind
Cause I'm a wanderer
Oh, yes
I'm a wanderer

[Verse 2]
She climbed right through the mirror
Oh, that really blew my mind
I think I'll follow through
Her rhythm and her rhyme
I know I'm ready now
It's just a little time
Cause I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer

[Chorus:]
Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer
You might also like[Verse 3:]
Slipped down the back stair on my toes
Then out the door
They didn't hear
Now they won't see me anymore
Cause I can't take that 9 to 5 life
It's a bore
Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

[Verse 4]
And so it's up and out
And on and off the road
Won't have no troubles
Cause the whole world is my home
No need to worry
Cause I seldom am alone
Cause I'm wanderer
I'm a wanderer

[Chorus:]
'cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'cause I'm wanderer
Got no time
Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer
[Bridge:]
Now you may see me
Any time and any place
And you may know me
From the same look on your face
And I don't know if I could change your frame of mind
Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

[Chorus:]
Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer
Cause I'm a wanderer
Cause I'm a wanderer
Cause I'm a wanderer
