9 ContributorsYou Are Everything Lyrics[Verse 1]
Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
She walked like you do
I thought it was you
As she turned the corner
I called out your name
I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you
Wasn't you

[Chorus]
You are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you

[Verse 2]
How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you?
I just can't go on
Living life as I do
Comparing each girl with you
Knowing they just won't do
They're not you
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you

[Post-Chorus]
You are everything
Everything is you
Oh, you are everything
Everything is you
Oh, you are everything
Everything is you
Oh, you are everything
Everything is youEmbed
