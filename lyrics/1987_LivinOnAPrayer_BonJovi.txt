Once upon a time, not so long ago

[Verse 1]
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

[Chorus]
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

[Verse 2]
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"

Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

[Bridge]
Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

[Chorus]
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
