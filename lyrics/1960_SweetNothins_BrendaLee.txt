Uh-huh, honey
Alright

[Verse 1]
My baby whispers in my ear
Mmm, sweet nothin's
He knows the things I like to hear
Mmm, sweet nothin's

[Refrain]
Things he wouldn't tell nobody else
Secret, baby, I keep 'em to myself
Sweet nothin's
Mmm, sweet nothin's

[Verse 2]
We walk along hand in hand
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Yeah, we both understand
Mmm, sweet nothin's

[Refrain]
Sittin' in class a-tryin' to read my book
My baby give me that special look
Sweet nothin's
Mmm, sweet nothin's

[Verse 3]
Ah, sittin' on my front porch
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Well, do I love you? Of course
Mmm, sweet nothin's

[Refrain]
Mama turned on the front porch light, sayin'
"Come in daughter, that's enough for tonight"
Sweet nothin's
Mmm, sweet nothin's
Sweet nothin's
Mmm, sweet nothin's
