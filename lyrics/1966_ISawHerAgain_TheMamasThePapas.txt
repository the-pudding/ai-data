I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't
Just string her along, it's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't

[Chorus]
But what can I do? I'm lonely, too
And it makes me feel so good to know
(And it makes me feel so good to know)
She'll never leave me

[Verse 2]
I'm in way over my head
Now she thinks that I love her
(Yeah, yeah, she loves you)
Because that's what I said
Though I never think of her
(No, no, never think of her)

[Chorus]
But what can I do? I'm lonely, too
And it makes me feel so good to know
(And it makes me feel so good to know)
She'll never leave me
You might also like[Bridge]
Every time I see that girl
You know I wanna lay down and die
But I really need that girl
Though I'm livin' a lie (Though I'm livin' a lie)
It makes me wanna cry

[Verse 3]
I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't
Just string her along, it's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't

[Chorus]
But what can I do? I'm lonely, too
And it makes me feel so good to know
(And it makes me feel so good to know)
She'll never leave me (To know, know)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
But what can I do? I'm lonely, too
Yeah, and it makes me feel so good to know
She'll never leave me
[Bridge]
Every time I see that girl
You know I wanna lay down and die
But I really need that girl
Though I'm livin' a lie (Though I'm livin' a lie)
It makes me wanna cry

[Verse 4]
I saw her, I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't (No, no)
Just string her along, it's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't (You say you wouldn't)

[Outro]
I'm in way over my head
Now she thinks that I love her (Yeah, yeah, she loves you)
Because that's what I said...Embed
