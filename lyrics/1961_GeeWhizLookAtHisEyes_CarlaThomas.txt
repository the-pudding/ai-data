8 ContributorsGee Whiz (Look at His Eyes) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gee whiz, look at his eyes
Gee whiz, how they hypnotize
He's got everything a girl could want
Man, oh, man, what a prize, ooh, ooh!

[Verse 2]
Gee whiz, he's all the joy
Gee whiz, I could find in a boy
He's awful nice, it's paradise
I hope I'm not his decoy

[Bridge]
Heaven up above knows how much
I love that gentle soul
Angels sing of a love like this
I hope our love will grow and grow

[Verse 3]
Oh, gee whiz, I love that guy
Gee whiz, my, my, oh my
There are things we could do
I could say I love you
But all I can say is: "Gee whiz!"You might also like1Embed
