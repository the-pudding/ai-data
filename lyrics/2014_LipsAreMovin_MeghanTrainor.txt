If your lips are movin'
If your lips are movin'
If your lips are movin', then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are movin'
If your lips are movin' (Ooh)
If your lips are movin', I said you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby

[Verse 1]
Boy, look at me in my face (Ah)
Tell me that you’re not just about this bass (Uh)
You really think I could be replaced?
Nah, I come from outer space (Huh)
And I'm a classy girl, I'ma hold it up
You full of somethin', but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new

[Pre-Chorus]
You can buy me diamond earrings
And deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar
So goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

[Chorus]
I know you're lyin' (Lyin')
'Cause your lips are movin' (Movin')
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young (Young)
But I ain't stupid (Stupid)
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (Bass)
You gave me sweet talk (Sweet talk)
Sayin' how I’m your number one (Woo-hoo)
But I know you lie (Lie)
'Cause your lips are movin' (Movin')
Baby, don't you know I'm done? (Hey)
