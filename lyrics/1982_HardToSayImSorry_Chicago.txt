3 ContributorsHard to Say Iâ€™m Sorry Lyrics"Everybody needs a little time away," I heard her say, "from each other."
"Even lover's need a holiday far away from each other."
Hold me now. It's hard for me to say I'm sorry. I just want you to stay

After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you. I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

Couldn't stand to be kept away just for the day from your body
Wouldn't wanna be swept away, far away from the one that I love
Hold me now. It's hard for me to say I'm sorry. I just want you to know
Hold me now. I really want to tell you I'm sorry. I could never let you go

After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you. I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you. I promise to
