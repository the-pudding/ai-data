Fe-fi-fo-fum
I can feel the presence of someone

[Chorus]
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair

[Verse 1]
They ate up all my food (Mm, mm, mm, mm)
And I don't stand for such
Don't tell me it was a woman (Mm, mm, mm, mm)
'Cause a woman don't eat that much
My brand new silk pajamas (What a shame, what a shame)
They were balled up in the chair
My mind ain't playin' tricks on me (What a shame, what a shame)
Lord help him if he's still here

[Chorus]
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Oh, somebody's been sitting in my chair

[Verse 2]
Cigarettes in my ashtray (Mm, mm, mm, mm)
And I don't even smoke
Somebody's been in my best booze (Mm, mm, mm, mm)
I can tell 'cause the seal is broke
I left my bedroom slippers (What a shame, what a shame)
Last night at the foot of my bed
And now they're in my livin' room (What a shame, what a shame)
And my bed was left unmade

Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been eating up my food
Oh, somebody's been walking in my shoes
Oh, somebody's been sitting in my chair
