31 ContributorsCloser Lyrics[Intro]
Closer, closer
Closer, closer (Woo)

[Verse 1]
Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Tellin' me that she wants to own me
To control me

[Pre-Chorus]
Come closer (Come closer)
Come closer

[Chorus]
And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell, I can't break
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself, no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop

I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I get, the more I want
She wants to own me

[Pre-Chorus]
Come closer (Come closer)
She says, "Come closer"
Hey

[Chorus]
And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell, I can't break
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself, no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop

[Post-Chorus]
Come closer, come closer
Come closer, come closer
Come closer, come closer
Come closer
[Bridge]
I just can't stop, no-woah-oh
I just can't stop, no-woah-oh (I just can't stop it, no, no)
I just can't stop, no-woah-oh (Just can't stop)
I just can't stop, no (No, no, no, no, no)

[Chorus]
And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell, I can't break
I just can't stop, I just can't stop (And I just can't stop)
I just can't stop, I just can't stop (And I just can't stop)
And I just can't bring myself no way (Bring myself)
But I don't want to escape (Bring myself)
I just can't stop, I just can't stop (And I just can't stop)
I just can't stop, I just can't stop  (Oh, and I just can't stop)
I just can't stop
And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell, I can't break
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop
