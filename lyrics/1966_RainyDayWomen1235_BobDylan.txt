43 ContributorsRainy Day Women #12 & 35 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, they'll stone you when you're tryin' to be so good
They'll stone you just like they said they would
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone

[Chorus]
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 2]
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor
They'll stone you when you're walking through the door

[Chorus]
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 3]
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck"

Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 4]
Well, they'll stone you and say that that's the end (Yeah)
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again (Yes they will)
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar

[Chorus]
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned, alright

[Verse 5]
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone (Oh, yes they will)
They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say they're all brave
They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave

[Chorus]
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned13Embed
