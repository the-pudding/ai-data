5 ContributorsTouch Me (All Night Long) Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're starting it over
We're making way for destiny
A time to turn over
A better life for you and me
A new recreation
To channel all this energy
Let's solve the equation
I need to feel you close to me

[Pre-Chorus]
So, baby
Let your conscience go
There's no turning back
When love takes hold

[Chorus]
Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long

Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
The more that I see you
The more I know that love belongs
With you in my mind, boy
I wouldn't know what's right from wrong
'Cause love will take over
And leave you out of sight and mind
Sight and mind
You've got to go with the feeling
And trust fate to be kind

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby
Let your conscience go
There's no turning back
When love takes hold

[Chorus]
Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long
Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long

[Interlude]
Let's do it
Oh oh oh oh
Let's do it

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby
Let your conscience go
There's no turning back
Once love gets hold

[Chorus]
Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long
Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long

Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long1Embed
