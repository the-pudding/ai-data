5 ContributorsPuppy Love Lyrics[Verse 1:]
And they called it puppy love
Oh, I guess they'll never know
How the young heart really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're in our teens
Tell them all
Please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream

[Verse 2:]
I cry each night
My tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll be back
(You’ll be back)
In my arms once again
(You’ll be back in my arms once again)

[Verse 3:]
Someone help me
Help me
Help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I
Oh, how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love
