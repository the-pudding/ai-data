Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey
Skippin' and a jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a thumpin'

[Refrain]
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall

[Refrain]
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da?
Just like that
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da
La-tee-da

[Verse 3]
So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium

[Refrain]
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Outro]
Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da? (Lyin' on the green grass)
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da (Bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit)
(Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da-la-tee-da-la-tee-da)
