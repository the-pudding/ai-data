1 ContributorThis Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
This time we're really breaking up
This time we said way too much
This times for all time
How about this time?

[Chorus]
This time there'll be no good nite kiss
This time is forever
This time I find that I'm
Really losing you

[Verse 2]
My heart is broken now
It really doesn't matter anyhow
Now that you're going away
I only live from day to day

[Chorus]
This time there'll be no good nite kiss
This time is forever
This time I find that I'm
Really losing youYou might also likeEmbed
