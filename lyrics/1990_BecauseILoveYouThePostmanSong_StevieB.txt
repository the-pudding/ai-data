4 ContributorsBecause I Love You (The Postman Song) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got your letter from the postman just the other day
So I decided to write you this song
And just to let you know exactly the way I feel
And let you know my love's for real

[Chorus]
Because I love you
And I'll do anything
I'll give you my heart, my everything
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide

[Verse 2]
If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Just let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I'll always be around

[Chorus]
Because I love you
My heart's an open door
Girl, won't you please come on in
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide

My heart's an open door
Girl, won't you please come on in
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide1Embed
