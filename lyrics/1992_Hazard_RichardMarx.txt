18 ContributorsHazard Lyrics[Verse 1]
My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right
Three years ago when I came in on Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
Saw the man inside

[Chorus 1]
We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

[Verse 2]
No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

[Chorus 2]
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

I think about my life gone by
How it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone

[Chorus 2]
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town1Embed
