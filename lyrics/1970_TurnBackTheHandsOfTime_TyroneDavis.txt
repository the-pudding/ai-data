8 ContributorsTurn Back The Hands Of Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh darlin', I'm so lonely without you
Can't sleep at night, always thinkin' about you

[Chorus]
But if I had the chance to start all over
I would be wishing today on a four leaf clover
And leaving would be the last thing on my mind
If I could turn back the hands of time
(If I could turn back the hands of time) Oh, baby
(If I could turn back the hands of time)

[Verse 2]
Oh darlin', I can't hold out much longer
But the pain is getting deep, oh, the hurt keep getting stronger

[Chorus]
But if I had just one more try
I would be yours alone until the day I die
And we would have a love so divine
If I could turn back the hands of time
(If I could turn back the hands of time) Oh, baby
(If I could turn back the hands of time)

[Bridge]
Mmm, remember, girl
That I love you
You might also like[Verse 3]
Oh darlin', please, please let me come back home
Your love has been so good to me, baby, and I just realized without it, I can't go on

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the other half that makes my life complete
If I had one more chance, we'd have a love so sweet
And leaving would be the last thing on my mind
If I could turn back the hands of time
(If I could turn back the hands of time) Oh, baby

[Outro]
(If I could turn back the hands of time) I love you
(If I could turn back the hands of time) Girl, I need you
(If I could turn back the hands of time) Mmm
(If I could turn back the hands of time) Oh, baby
(If I could turn back the hands of time) I've got to have you
(If I could turn back the hands of time) Hey!Embed
