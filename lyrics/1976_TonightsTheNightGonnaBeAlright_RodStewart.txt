Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line
Relax baby and draw that blind

[Verse 2]
Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen up that pretty French gown
Let me pour you a good long drink
Ooh, baby, don't you hesitate 'cause

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

[Verse 3]
C'mon, angel, my hearts on fire
Don't deny your man's desire
You'd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside 'cause

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

[Verse 4]
Don't say a word my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the night's too old

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you woman
Ain't nobody gonna stop us nowEmbed
