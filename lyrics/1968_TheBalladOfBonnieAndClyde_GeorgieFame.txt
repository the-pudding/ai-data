Bonnie and Clyde were pretty-looking people
But I can tell you, people, they were the Devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil-doin'
One lazy afternoon down Savannah way
They robbed a store and high-tailed out of that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited 'til the heat died down

[Verse 2]
Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation into the banking business
"Reach for the sky!" sweet-talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag
Now one brave man, he tried to take them alone
They left him lying in a pool of blood
And laughed about it all the way home

[Bridge]
Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun
They used to laugh about dyin'
But deep inside them, they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lyin'
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew

Acting upon reliable information
A federal deputation laid a deadly ambush
When Bonnie and Clyde came walkin' in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them

[Outro]
Bonnie and Clyde
They lived a lot together
And finally, together
They diedEmbed
