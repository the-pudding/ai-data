[Verse 1]
Hey, Mickey
You've been around all night
And that's a little long
You think you've got the right
But I think you've got it wrong
Why canâ€™t you say goodnight
So you can take me home Mickey?
'Cause when you say you will
It always means you won't
You're giving me the chills
Baby, please, baby, don't
Every night you still leave me all alone, Mickey
You might also like[Chorus]

Oh, what you do, Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Anyway you wanna do it

Oh, please, baby, please
Don't leave me in the jam, Mickey
