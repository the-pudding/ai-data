(I remember) I remember my first love affair
(I remember) Somehow or another the whole darn thing went wrong
(I remember) My mama had some great advice so I thought I'd put it into words of this song
(I remember) I can still hear her sayin'

[Verse 1]
Boy (Boy, boy), oh, I see you're sittin' out there all alone
Cryin' your eyes out 'cause the woman that you love is gone
Oh, there's gonna be, there's gonna be a whole lot of trouble in your life
(A whole lot of trouble)
Oh, so listen to me, get up off your knees 'cause only the strong survive
That's what she said

[Chorus]
"Only the strong survive, only the strong survive"
Hey, you've got to be strong (Strong), you'd better hold on (Hold on)

[Verse 2]
Don't go  (Don't go) all around with your head hung down
Well I wouldn't let the little girl know, wouldn't let her know that she made me feel like a clown
There's a whole lot a girls (A whole lot of girls) lookin' for a good man like you
Oh but you'll never meet 'em if you give up now and say your life is through
Then she said:

[Chorus]
"Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Yeah, you've got to be a man (Man), you've got to take a stand"
You might also like[Instrumental Break]
So I'm telling you right now

[Chorus]
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Hey, you've got to be strong (Strong), you'd better hold on (Hold on)

[Outro]
Don't worry about it, don't you know that things are gonna change (Only the strong survive)
Oh, but you've got to be a man (Yeah), you've got to take a stand (Yeah)
Don't ever feel that, you can make it baby (Only the strong survive)
Oh so ain't no woman worth it, you've gotta make itEmbed
