9 ContributorsWishin’ and Hopin’ LyricsWishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin'
Plannin' and dreamin' each night of his charms
That won't get you into his arms

So if you're lookin' to find love you can share
All you gotta do is
Hold him and kiss him and love him
And show him that you care

Show him that you care just for him
Do the things he likes to do
Wear your hair just for him, cause
You won't get him
Thinkin' and prayin'
Wishin' and hopin'

Just wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin'
Plannin' and dreamin' his kisses will start
That won't get you into his heart

So if you're thinkin' how great true love is
All you gotta do is
Hold him and kiss him and squeeze him and love him
Yeah, just do it and after you do, you will be his

You gotta show him that you care just for him
Do the things he likes to do
Wear your hair just for him, cause
You won't get him
Thinkin' and prayin'
Wishin' and hopin'
