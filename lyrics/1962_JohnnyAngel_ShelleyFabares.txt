(Johnny Angel, Johnny Angel, Johnny Angel)
Johnny Angel, you're an angel to me

[Verse 1]
Johnny Angel, how I love him
He's got something that I can't resist
But he doesn't even know that I exist

[Verse 2]
Johnny Angel, how I want him
How I tingle when he passes by
Every time he says hello, my heart begins to fly

[Pre-Chorus]
(I'm in Heaven) I get carried away
I dream of him and me
And how it's gonna be
(Other fellas) Call me up for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate

[Chorus]
On Johnny Angel (Johnny Angel)
'Cause I love him ('Cause I love him)
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see
How lovely Heaven will be
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
(I'm in Heaven) I get carried away
I dream of him and me
And how it's gonna be
(Other fellas) Call me up for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate

[Chorus]
On Johnny Angel (Johnny Angel)
'Cause I love him ('Cause I love him)
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see
How lovely Heaven will be

[Outro]

You're an angel to me
