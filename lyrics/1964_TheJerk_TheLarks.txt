1 ContributorThe Jerk Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girls, hey, what's that you're doing
Girl, girl, what's that you're doing
You got to show me the steps to it
Somehow, gonna learn how to do it
Doing the Jerk
Hey, do the jerk
Girl, come on and work
Hey, do the jerk

[Verse 2]
Girl, how do you move your hips so fine
Girl (Come on now) Work it out, right on time
Everybody's got the beat
Hey-ay, look at me
I'm doing the Jerk
Yeah, now watch me work
Girl, now do the jerk
Hey, do the jerk

[Bridge]
Go on and soul
Soul, soul, soul
Soul everybody now
Soul, soul, soul
