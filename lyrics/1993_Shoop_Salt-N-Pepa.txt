61 ContributorsShoop Lyrics[Intro: Pepa]
Hey, yeah
I wanna shoop, baby (Shoop)
Ooh, how you doing, baby? (Shoop)
No, not you, you (Shoop)
The bow-legged one, haha, yeah, what’s your name? (Shoop)
Damn, baby, that sounds sexy, uh (Shoop)

[Verse 1: Pepa]
Here I go, here I go, here I go again (Again)
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!) Okay then
Chilling, chilling, minding my business (Word)
Yo Salt, I looked around and I couldn't believe this
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness
The brother had it going on with something kinda, uh (Shoop)
Wicked, wicked, had to kick it
I'm not shy, so I asked for the digits (Shoop)
A ho, no, that don't make me
See what I want, slip-slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks on him (Shoop)
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop-shoop-shoop (Shoop)

Shoop-a-doop, shoop-a-doop
Shoop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop
Shoop-a-doop, shoop-a-doop
Shoop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop (Um)

[Verse 2: Salt]
You're packed and you're stacked, 'specially in the back
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (Thanks, Mom)
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie?
If looks could kill you would be an Uzi
Or a shotgun, bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know, How does it hang? (Shoop)
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha— well, uh (Shoop)
I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile
Smooth Black skin with a smile (Shoop)
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun
Come and give me some of that yum-yum chocolate chip (Come on, come on)
Honey dip, can I get a scoop? (Please)
Baby, take a ride in my coupe, you make me wanna (Shoop)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby
Ayy-hey
Ayy-hey (Shoop)
Don't you know I wanna shoop, baby? (Shoop)
[Chorus]
Shoop-a-doop, shoop-a-doop
Shoop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop (Shoop)
Shoop-a-doop, shoop-a-doop
Shoop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop (Shoop)

[Verse 3: Pepa]
Well, let me bring you back to the subject, Pep's on the set
Make you get hot, make you work up a sweat
When you skip-to-my-lou, my darling
Not falling in love, but I'm falling for your
Super sperm (Hm), when I get ya
Bet your bottom dollar you are best under pressure
Yo, Sandy, I wanna, like, taste you
Getcha, getcha lips wet cause it's time to have Pep (Shoop)

[Verse 4: Salt]
On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop
To the next man in the three-piece suit
I spend all my do-re-mi, cutie
Shoop, shoop a-doobie like Scooby-Dooby-Doo (Shoop)
I love you in your big jeans, you give me nice dreams
You make me wanna scream, ooh-ooh-ooh
I like what you do when you do
What you do, you make me wanna shoop (Shoop)
[Chorus]
Shoop-a-doop, shoop-a-doop
Shoop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop (Shoop)
Shoop-a-doop, shoop-a-doop
Shoop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop (Shoop)

[Interlude: Salt]
Oh my goodness
Mm, girl, look at him (Shoop)
He is the cutest brother in here
And he's comin' this way, ooh (Shoop)

[Verse 5: Big Twan & Salt]
S and the P wanna get with me, cool (Uh-huh)
But I'm wicked, G, (Yeah) hit skins but never quickly (That's right)
I hit the skins for the hell of it, just for the yell I get
Mm-mm-mm, for the smell of it (Smell of it)
They want my bod, here's the hot rod (Hot rod)
Twelve inches to a yard (Damn) and have you sounding like a retard (Yeah)
Big 'Twan Lover, six-two, wanna hit you
So what you wanna do? What you wanna do? (Mm, I wanna shoop)

Shoop-a-doop, shoop-a-doop
