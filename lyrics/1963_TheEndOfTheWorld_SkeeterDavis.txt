Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
'Cause you don't love me any more

[Verse 2]
Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love

[Bridge]
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

[Verse 3]
Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

[Outro]
Why does my heart go on beating? Hmm, hmm
Why do these eyes of mine cry? Hmm, hmm
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbyeYou might also like19Embed
