12 ContributorsMidnight Confessions Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
The sound of your footsteps
Tellin' me that you're near
Your soft gentle motion, babe
Brings out a need in me
That no one can hear except

[Chorus]
In my midnight confessions
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confessions
When I say all the things
That I want to, I love you

[Post-Chorus]
But a little gold ring you wear on your hand
Makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wastin' my time
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Staggerin' through the daytime
Your image on my mind
Passin' so close beside you, babe
Sometimes the feelings
Are so hard to hide, but
You might also like[Chorus]
In my midnight confessions
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confessions
When I say all the things
That I want to, I love you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Post-Chorus]
There's a little gold ring you wear on your hand
That makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wastin' my time

[Bridge]
In my midnight confessions
When I'm tellin' the world that I love you
In my midnight confessions
When I say all the things that I want to

[Outro]
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na, na-na, na, na-na
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na, na-na, na, na-na...1Embed
