She says she's no good
With words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out a joke of a romantic
Stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Overdramatic
Tonight, it's "it can't get much worse"
Versus "No one should ever feel like..."

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by (...emal si namhorT eoJ)

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half-time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

But only the first mistake, and I

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (love)

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half-time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

[Bridge]
Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half-time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love me (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me...
