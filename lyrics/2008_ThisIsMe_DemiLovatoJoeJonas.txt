I've always been the kind of girl that hid my face
So afraid to tell the world what I've got to say
But I have this dream, bright inside of me
I'm gonna let it show, it's time to let you know
To let you know

[Chorus: Mitchie]
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me

[Verse 2: Mitchie]
Do you know what it's like to feel so in the dark?
To dream about a life where you're the shining star?
Even though it seems like it's too far away
I have to believe in myself, it's the only way

[Chorus: Mitchie]
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
I need to find you, I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you, I gotta find you

[Chorus: Mitchie, Mitchie & Shane]
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am (Yeah)
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be, yeah

[Outro: Mitchie, Shane, both]
This is me
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
This is me, yeah
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
