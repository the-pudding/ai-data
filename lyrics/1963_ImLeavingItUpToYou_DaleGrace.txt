4 ContributorsIâ€™m Leaving It Up to You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm leavin' it all up to you
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love
Or are we through?

[Verse 2]
That's why I'm leaving it up to you
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love
Or are we through?

[Bridge]
I've got my heart in my hand
I, I, I don't understand
What have I, what have I done wrong?
You know I worship the ground you walk on

[Verse 2]
That's why I'm leavin' it up to you oh oh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love?
Or are we through?

[Outro]
Or are we through?You might also likeEmbed
