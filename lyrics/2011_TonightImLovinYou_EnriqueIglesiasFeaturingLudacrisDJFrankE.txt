You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
I know you want me
I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you
Now rock your body, oh-oh
Damn, I like the way that you move
So give it to me, oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause I already know what you wanna do

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
But tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

You're so damn pretty
If I had a type, then baby, it would be you
I know you're ready
If I never lied, then, baby, you'll be the truth

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
But tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Ha! Luda)
Tonight I'm gonna do everything that I want with you
Everything that you need, everything that you want
I'm on the hunt, I wanna stunt with you
From the window to the wall, gotta give you my all
Winter or the summertime, when I get you on the springs, I'ma make you fall
You got that body that make me wanna get up on the floor just to see you dance
And I love the way you shake that ass, turn around and let me see them pants
You're stuck with me, I'm stuck with you, let's find somethin' to do
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude
[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias with Ludacris]
But tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know that tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh, you know
