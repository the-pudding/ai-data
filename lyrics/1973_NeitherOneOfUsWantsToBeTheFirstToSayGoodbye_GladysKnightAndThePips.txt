It's sad to think
We're not gonna make it
And it's gotten to the point
Where we just can't fake it
Ooh, for some ungodly reason (Ooh-ooh)
We just won't let it die (Let it die)
I guess neither one of us (Neither one of us)
Wants to be the first to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I keep wondering (Wondering)
What I'm gonna do without you (Do without you)
And I guess you must be
Wondering that same thing too
So we go on, go on together
Living a lie (Living a lie)
Because neither one of us (Neither one of us)
Wants to be the first to say goodbye

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, every time I find the nerve
Every time I find the nerve to say I'm leaving (Leaving)
Old memories, those old memories get in my way, ooh, ooh (My way, my way)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Lord knows it's only me
Oh, He knows it's only me that I'm deceiving
Ooh, ooh, ooh
When it comes to saying goodbye
That's a simple word that I just cannot say
You might also like[Verse 3]
There can be no way, there can be no way (Be no way)
This can have a happy ending (Happy ending), no, no
So we just go on (We go on)
Hurting and pretending
And convincing ourselves to give it just one more try (One more try)
Because neither one of us (Neither one of us)
Ooh, ooh, wants to be the first to say it
Neither one of us (Neither one of us)
Wants to be the first to say it
Ooh, neither one of us (Neither one of us)
Wants to be the first to say
Farewell my love
Goodbye (Goodbye)1Embed
