20 ContributorsWhat Becomes of the Brokenhearted Lyrics{Intro}

[Verse 1]
As I walk this land of broken dreams (Broken dreams)
I have visions of many things (So many things)
But happiness is just an illusion (Just an illusion)
Filled with sadness and confusion

[Chorus]
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

[Verse 2]
The roots of love grow all around (All around)
But for me they come a tumblin' down (Tum, tumblin' down)
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger (Just a little stronger)
I can't stand this pain much longer

[Verse 3]
I walk in shadows searching for light (Searching for light)
Cold and alone no comfort in sight (No comfort in sight)
Hoping and praying for someone who cares (Who really cares)
Always moving and going nowhere
You might also like[Chorus]
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind
Help me

[Verse 4]
I'm searching though I don't succeed (Don't succeed)
But someone look, there's a growing need (Such a growing need)
All is lost, there's no place for beginning (No beginning)
All that's left is an unhappy ending

[Chorus]
Now what becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere just to find someone to care

[Outro]
I'll be looking everyday, I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere
I know I'm gonna find a way2Embed
