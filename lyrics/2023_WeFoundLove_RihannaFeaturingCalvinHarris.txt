3 ContributorsWe Found Love / Alone (Mixed) Lyrics[Chorus]
I been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?
I just want you here by my side
I don't wanna be here, baby, on my own
Yeah, don't you wait, don't think about it
Yeah, don't you wait, just come on over now
I been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?

[Verse]
Oh, look at me, like what you see?
I've been feelin' lonely, baby, you got what I need
Give me what I like, tryna uh tonight
Got an appetite that only you can satisfy (Satisfy)
I could ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it all night
Watch me ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it all night
Wanna feel the rush, wanna feel your touch
Don't talk your talk unless you're gonna back it up

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want me, let me know
Tell me now, don't hesitate
You got one chance, baby, don't
Let the moment slip away, no
You might also like[Chorus]
I been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?
I just want you here by my side
I don't wanna be here, baby, on my own
Yeah, don't you wait, don't think about it
Yeah, don't you wait, just come on over now
I been tryna give it to you all night
What's it gonna take to get you all alone?Embed
