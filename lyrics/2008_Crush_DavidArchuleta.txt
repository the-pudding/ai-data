22 ContributorsCrush Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, woah, woah
Oh, woah

[Verse 1]
I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time deep inside
It was a rush, what a rush (What a rush)
'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
Just too much, just too much (Just too much)

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I keep runnin' from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

[Chorus]
Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we could be, where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or fallin' in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch your breath when I look at you?
Are you holdin' back like the way you do?
'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hangin', spendin' time, girl
Are we just friends? Is there more, is there more? (Is there more?)
See, it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe that we can make this into
Somethin' that will last, last forever, forever

[Chorus]
Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we could be, where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or fallin' in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch your breath when I look at you?
Are you holdin' back like the way you do?
'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I keep runnin' from the truth? (Why do I keep runnin'?)
All I ever think about is you (All I ever think about)
You got me hypnotized (Hypnotized), so mesmerized (Mesmerized)
And I just got to know
[Chorus]
Do you ever think (Ever think) when you're all alone (All alone)
All that we could be, where this thing could go? (Go)
Am I crazy or fallin' in love? (Crazy)
Is it real or just another crush? (Another crush)
Do you catch your breath when I look at you? (Yeah, yeah)
Are you holdin' back like the way you do?
'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away (Ooh, woah)
But I know this crush ain't
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (This crush ain't)
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Goin' away)

[Outro]
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do you ever think when you're all alone)
(All that we could be, where this thing could go?)
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' away (Do you catch your breath when I look at you?)
(Are you holdin' back like the way you do?)
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do you ever think when you're all alone)
Oh (All that we could be, where this thing could go?)
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Do you catch your breath when I look at you?)7Embed
