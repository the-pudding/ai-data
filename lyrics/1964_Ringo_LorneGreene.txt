19 ContributorsRingo Lyrics[Intro]
They lie in boothills all through the West
The outlaws, the gunslingers, the Billy the Kids and worse
Say a fella like the coward that shot Bill Hickock in the back
There's always one like that in every time of history
Most of them were varmints
But every once in a while in one of them
There may have lived a man

[Verse 1]
He lay face down in the desert sand
Clutching his six-gun in his hand
Shot from behind, I thought he was dead
For under his heart was an ounce of lead
But a spark still burned so I used my knife
And late that night I saved the life of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)

[Verse 2]
I nursed him 'til the danger passed
The days went by, he mended fast
And then from dawn 'til setting sun
He practiced with that deadly gun
And hour on hour I watched in awe
No human being could match the draw of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)

One day we rode the mountain crest
And I went East, and he went West
I took to law and wore a star
While he spread terror, near and far
With lead and blood he gained such fame
All through the West they feared the name of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)

[Verse 4]
I knew someday I'd face the test
Which one of us would be the best
And sure enough the word came down
That he was holed up in the town
I left the posse out in the street
And I went in alone to meet Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)

[Verse 5]
They said my speed was next to none
But my lightning draw had just begun
When I heard a blast that stung my wrist
The gun went flying from my fist
And I was looking down the bore
Of the deadly .44 of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)
[Verse 6]
They say that was the only time
That anyone had seen him smile
He slowly lowered his gun and then
He said to me "We're even, friend"
And so at last I understood
That there was still a spark of good in Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)

[Verse 7]
I blocked the path of his retreat
He turned and stepped into the street
A dozen guns spit fire and lead
A moment later, he lay dead
The town began to shout and cheer
Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo
(Ringo)

[Outro]
The story spread throughout the land
That I had beaten Ringo's hand
And it was just the years, they say
That made me put my guns away
But on his grave they can't explain
The tarnished star above the name of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)
(Ringo, Ringo)Embed
