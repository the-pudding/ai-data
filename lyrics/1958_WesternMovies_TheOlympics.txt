5 ContributorsWestern Movies LyricsTo save my soul I can't get a date
Baby's got it tuned on channel eight
Now Wyatt Earp and the Big Cheyenne
They're comin' through the T.V. shootin up the land
Ah...um...my baby loves the Western movies
My baby loves the Western movies
Bam, bam, shoot 'em up Pow
Ah..um..My babe loves the Western Movies
I call my baby on the telephone
To tell her half my head was gone
I just got hit by a great big brick
She says thanks for reminding me it's time for Maverick
Ah..um...my baby loves the Western movies
My baby loves the Western movies
Bam, bam, shoot em up pow
Ah...um...
My baby loves the Western movies
Well there's Jeremy Roller and Old Cochise
Jim Hardy, Jim Bowie and Sugarfoot
They all have gun will travel
Give me back my boots and saddle uh huh
Here's the story of the certain Wagon Train Mccord
A broken arrow has broken my heart
A Jefferson Drum with his Restless Gun
Hog-tied my baby and the fight was won
Ah..um...my baby loves the Western movies
My baby loves the western movies
Bam bam shoot em up pow
Ah um, my baby loves the western moviesYou might also likeEmbed
