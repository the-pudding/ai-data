14 ContributorsBlack & White Lyrics[Verse 1]
The ink is black, the page is white
Together we learn to read and write
A child is Black, a child is white
The whole world looks upon the sight
A beautiful sight

[Bridge]
And now a child can understand
That this is the law of all the land
All the land

[Verse 2]
The world is black, the world is white
It turns by day and then by night
A child is Black, a child is white
Together they grow to see the light
To see the light

[Bridge]
And now, at last
We plainly see
We'll have a dance of liberty
Liberty

[Verse 3]
The world is black, the world is white
It turns by day and then by night
A child is Black, a child is white
The whole world looks upon the sight
A beautiful sight

The world is black, the world is white
It turns by day and then by night
A child is Black, a child is white
Together they grow to see the light
To see the light

The world is black, the world is white
It turns by day and then by night
A child is Black, a child is white
The whole world looks upon the sight
A beautiful sight

The world is black, the world is white
It turns by day and then by night
A child is Black, a child is white
Together they grow to see the light
To see the light

Come on
Get it
Get it
Oh yeah
Yeah
Keep it up now, around the world
Little boys and little girls
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
YeahEmbed
