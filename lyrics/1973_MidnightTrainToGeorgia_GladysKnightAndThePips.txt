Mm, L.A
Proved too much for the man (Too much for the man, he couldn't make it)
So he's leavin' the life
He's come to know, ooh (He said he's goin')
He said he's goin' back to find (Goin' back to find)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind not so long ago

[Chorus]
He's leavin' (Leavin')
On that midnight train to Georgia (Leavin' on that midnight train)
Mm, yes
Said he's goin' back (Goin' back to find)
To a simpler place and time (Whenever he takes that ride)
Oh, yes, he is (Guess who's gonna be right by his side)
And I'll be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia (Leavin' on that midnight train to Georgia)
Yeah (Woo, woo)
I'd rather live in his world (Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine (Her world is his, his and hers alone)

[Verse 2]
He kept dreamin' (Dreamin')
Ooh, that someday he'd be a star (A superstar, but he didn't get far)
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true (Dreams don't always come true)
Oh, no, uh-uh (Uh-uh, no, uh-uh)
So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his old car
Bought a one-way ticket back
To the life he once knew
Oh, yes, he did, he said he would
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, no, he's leavin (Leavin')
On that midnight train to Georgia (Leavin' on that midnight train)
Hmm, yeah
Said he's goin' back to find (Goin' back to find)
Ooh, a simpler place and time (Whenever he takes that ride)
Oh, yeah (Guess who's gonna be right by his side)
I'm gonna be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia (Leavin' on the midnight train to Georgia)
Oh (Woo, woo)
I'd rather live in his world (Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine (Her world is his, his and hers alone)

Ooh, he's leavin' (Leavin')
On the midnight train to Georgia (Leavin' on the midnight train)
Yeah, ooh, y'all
Said he's goin' back to find (Goin' back to find)
Ooh, a simpler place and time (Whenever he takes that ride)
Ooh, y'all, uh-huh (Guess who's gonna be right by his side)
I've got to be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia (Leavin' on the midnight train to Georgia)
Yeah (Woo, woo)
I'd rather live in his world (Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine (Her world is his, his and hers alone)

[Outro]
Oh (For love)
For love (Gonna board)
Gonna board the midnight train to ride
For love (For love)
Gonna board (Gonna board)
Gotta board the midnight train to go
For love (For love)
Gonna board (Gonna board)
Uh-huh, the midnight train to go
My world (For love)
His world (Gonna board)
Our world, mine and his alone (The midnight train to go)
My world (For love)
His world (Gonna board)
Our world, mine and his alone (The midnight train to go)
I've got to go (For love)
I've got to go (Gonna board)

I've got to go (For love)
I've got to go (Gonna board)

Oh, I've got to go (The midnight train to go)

His world (Gonna board)
Our world, his girlâ€¦3Embed
