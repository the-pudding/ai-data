How are the tenders, Johnny?

[Verse 1]
Why don't you ask him if he's gonna stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?

[Verse 2]
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?

[Verse 3]
Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him the latest on his throne?
(Ooga-aga-ooga)

[Chorus]
Don't say that you love me (Hiyee)
Just tell me that you want me (Hiyee)
Tusk!
Just say that you want me (Hiyee)
Don't tell me that youâ€”

[Post-Chorus]
Tusk!
(Real savage-like)
[Outro]
Tusk!
Tusk!
Tusk! Tusk! Tusk!You might also like10Embed
