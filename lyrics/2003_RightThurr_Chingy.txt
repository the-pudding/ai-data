Uh
Hey, Dirty (What?)
Look at that girl right thurr (Ooh), she make me say
Ooh, ooh (Yeah), ooh, ooh (Ayy)
Do what you do (C'mon)

[Chorus]
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)

[Verse 1]
I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine (Fine)
Lil momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (Dime)
The type of girl that'll get'cha up and go make you grind (Grind)
I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, Dirty, makin' her mine
Look at her hips (What?), look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (Stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (Back)
I like it when I touch it 'cause she moan a lil' bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit
I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the Regal
I swooped on her like an eagle swoop down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gonna be famous today, I say

[Verse 2]
She be shoppin' in Frontenac
Just look at her front and back
Man, she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl, can I taste yo cat?
Gave her three hundred to strip, like buyin' a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events (Yeah), cuss out the press when she pass (Yeah)
All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gon' drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops

[Chorus]
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)

I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)
[Post-Chorus]
I like the way she doin' that (C'mon)
Plus I like it when she bring it back (Say it)
Ooh, (Uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (Uh-huh) do what you do (Woo)
I like the way she doin' that (C'mon)
Plus I like it when she bring it back (Say it)
Ooh, (Uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (Uh-huh) do what you do (Woo)

[Verse 3]
Gimme what you got for a pork chop
Uh, she threw it at me like I was a shortstop
Huh, twerkin' in a Fatty Girl halter top
Then she back it up on me and let it drop (Drop)
Make it hop (boing) like a bunny (Bunny)
Girl, can I touch you where it's sunny?
Her a purse, will make you give her some money
She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture-perfect sight
When she pass, all the other girls hate it

[Chorus]
But I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)
