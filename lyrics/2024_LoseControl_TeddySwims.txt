Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

[Verse 2]
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin and your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of meEmbed
