115 ContributorsCold Water Lyrics[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, Justin Bieber & MØ]
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old, o-old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

[Bridge: MØ]
Come on, come on, save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat, I'm all alone (Float, float, float, float)

Somewhere I can rest my soul (Rest my soul)
I need to know
