6 ContributorsLove or Let Me Be Lonely Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love or let me be lonely
Part time love I can find any day
So don't defy mother nature's way please
Make it mine, a love for to stay

[Chorus]
I can live without love
If I wanted to in this lonely room
But I don't want to, so I leave it up to you
To wash away my gloom
Oh, oh, oh

I can live without love
If I wanted to in this lonely room
But I don't want to, so I leave it up to you
To wash away my gloom

Do doo, do doo, do doo, do doo

[Verse 2]
Either you will or either you won't now (You leave or you won't now)
It's up to you, I've had my say (I've got nothing to say)
So truly, love, do love me completely
Hey, come on, come on, come my way
You might also like[Chorus]
I can live without love
If I wanted to in this lonely room
But I don't want to, so I leave it up to you
To wash away my gloom

I can live without love
If I wanted to in this lonely room
But I don't want to, so I leave it up to you
To wash away my gloom

Do doo, do doo, do doo, do doo
Do doo, do doo

[Bridge]
Hmm, yeah
Why, baby
Mmm, yeah
My, my, my, my, my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my baby

[Chorus]
I can live without love
If I wanted to in this lonely room
But I don't want to, so I leave it up to you
To wash away my gloom
I can live without love
If I wanted to in this lonely room
But I don't want to, so I leave it up to you
To wash away my gloom

Do doo, do doo, do doo, do doo
Do doo, do doo

[Outro]
Love or let me be lonely
Love or let me be lonely
Give me your sweet lovin', baby (Love or let me be lonely)
Love or let me be lonely
Give me your love, baby (Love or let me be lonely)
Love or let me be lonely
Baby, baby, love (Love or let me be lonely)
Mmm, love or let me be lonely
Give me some love, ooh (Love or let me be lonely)
Love or let me be lonely
Love (Love)Embed
