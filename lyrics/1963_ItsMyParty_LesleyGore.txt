It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

[Verse 1]
Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone (Johnny has gone)
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine?

[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

[Verse 2]
Play all my records, keep dancing all night (Dancing all night)
But leave me alone for a while
'Til Johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile

[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Judy and Johnny just walked through the door (Walked through the door)
Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearin' his ring

[Outro]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Oh-oh, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to12Embed
