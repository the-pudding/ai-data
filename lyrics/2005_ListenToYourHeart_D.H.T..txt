1 ContributorListen to Your Heart (Hixxy Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

[Drop]

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listеn to your heart
There's nothing еlse you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before
You tell him goodbye

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams
To your dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

[Chorus]
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before
You tell him goodbye
