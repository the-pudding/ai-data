5 ContributorsThe House That Jack Built Lyrics[Intro]
This is the house that Jack built, y'all
Remember this house

[Verse 1]
This was the land that he worked by hand
It was the dream of an upright man
There was the room that was filled with love
It was a love that I was proud of
This was a life of a love that he planned
On the love, the same old love

[Chorus]
In the house that Jack built
(The house that Jack built)
Remember this house

[Verse 2]
There was the fence that held our love (Yes it was)
There was the gate that he walked out of
This is the heart that is turned to stone (Yes it is)
This was the house, but it ain't no home
This is the love that I once had
In a dream that I thought was love

[Chorus]
In the house that Jack built
(The house that Jack built)
I'm gon' remember this house
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh, what's the use of crying?
You know I brought it on myself
There's no denying
But it seems awful funny
That I didn't understand
Was it a house of an upright man, y'all?

Up on the hill there's a big plan still
In the house that Jack built
(The house that Jack built)
I'm gon' remember this house
(The house that Jack built)
Listen!
I got the house
I got the car
I got the rug
And I got the rack
But I ain't got Jack
(I ain't got Jack, Jack, Jack)
And I want my Jack back!
(I ain't got Jack, Jack, Jack)

[Outro]
I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
I turned my back on Jack
He said he wasn't coming back
Oh, Jack
You oughta come on back
(Come on, come on, come on)
Oh, Jack
(Come on back, Jack)
You oughta come on back
(Come on back, Jack)
To the one that you built
(Come on back, Jack)
It's the same one that you built
(Come on back, Jack)
You oughta come on back, Jack
(Come on, come on, come on)
Oh, come back
I didn't understand
(Come on back, Jack)
Until I lost my upright man
(Come on back, Jack)
Come on back, Jack
(Come on back, Jack)
You oughta come on home now
(Come on back, Jack)1Embed
