28 ContributorsYo (Excuse Me Miss) Lyrics[Intro]
Woah, woah
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' ever seen before
I say, "Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her" (Meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is, I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me, miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
And I gotta admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me, miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

Now shawty, grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance
(Don't worry 'bout it, we just one-two step, one-two step)
Now if the music is movin' too fast (Too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter (Tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
Girl, there's somethin' about you that makes me wanna say (Aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me, miss (Ooh)
I saw you from across the room
And I gotta admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me, miss (Ooh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me, miss
I saw you from across the room
And I gotta admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me, miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
[Bridge]
I wanna be where you are
Ain't nothin' wrong with dancin'
Baby, you're so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you
I think that I should start by sayin'

[Chorus]
Yo, woah
I don't know your name but excuse me, miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her (Oh yeah)
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me, miss (Oh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Outro]
Now everybody just clap your hands like this (Like this)
Just clap your hands like this (Woah, like this, huh)
And if your shorty's in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand, homie, make her understand
Y'all was made to dance like this (Like this)
Y'all was made to bounce like this (Woah, like this)
Just let her know she was made for you and
You wanna do everything she want to, man
Ha, woo!40Embed
