Watch out
Oh, girls, you know we've got to
Watch out
Girls, you know we've got to

[Chorus]
Watch out
Here comes that playboy (He, he's a playboy)
Watch out
Here comes that playboy (He, he, he's a playboy)
Watch out, here comes that playboy

[Verse 1]
Playboy, get away from my door
I heard about the lovers you had before
You took their love for a game of joy (Whoa, yeah)
And tossed their hearts around as though it was a toy (Oh, yeah), playboy

[Verse 2]
Well, playboy, find yourself some other toy
'Cause this is one heart you won't destroy
'Cause I can't stand for what you're putting down (Whoa, yeah)
Fooling around with every girl in town (Oh, yeah), playboy

[Bridge]
Well, you ain't saying nothing in my book
'Cause this is one fish you'll never, ever hook (Please)
You left the others standing with their hearts in pain (So, playboy)
And now you're coming round tryin' to do me the same
You might also like[Verse 3]
So, playboy, I've seen your kind
Winning every girl with that same old line
So, playboy, stay away from my door (Whoa, yeah)
I know about the lovers you had before (Oh, yeah), playboy

[Chorus]
Whoa, you know you've got to
Watch out, here comes that playboy
Yes, you know you've got to
Watch out, here comes that playboy

Oh, you've got to
Watch out, here comes that playboy
You better (Watch out)
You better (Watch out)

[Bridge]
You ain't saying nothing in my book
'Cause this is one fish you'll never, ever hook (Please)
You left the others standing with their hearts in pain (So, playboy)
And now you're coming round trying to do me the same

[Verse 3]
So, playboy, I've seen your kind
Winning every girl with that same old line
So, playboy, stay away from my door (Whoa, yeah)
I know about the lovers you had before (Oh, yeah), playboy
[Chorus]
Whoa, you know you better
Watch out, here comes that playboy
Watch out, here comes that playboy
Watch for the playboy
He's bringing me false joy

Watch out
Here comes that playboy (He-e-e's a playboy)
Watch out
Here comes that playboy (He's a playboy)
Watch out, here comes that playboy (He's a playboy)Embed
