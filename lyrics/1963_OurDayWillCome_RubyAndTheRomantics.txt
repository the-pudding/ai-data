Our day will come
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me
That I'm too young to know (Young to know)
I love you so (Love you so)
And you love me

[Verse 2]
Our day will come
If we just wait a while
No tears for us
Think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic because
We'll always stay
In love this way
Our day will come (Our day will come, our day will come)

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Our dreams have magic because
We'll always stay
In love this way
Our day will come
