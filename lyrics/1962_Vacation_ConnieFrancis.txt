4 ContributorsVacation LyricsV-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! In the summer sun!
Put away the books, we're outta school!
The weather's warm, but we'll play it cool!
We're on vacation, havin' lots of fun!
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! In the summer sun!
We're gonna grab a bite at the pizza stand
Write love letters in the sand
We're on vacation, and the world is ours!
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! Under summer stars!
Yeah, we'll hop in our jalopy to a drive-in movie
And have a look at the show
We're gonna hug and kiss, just like this
And I can't wait to go-oo-oo
We're gonna mash potato to a jukebox tune
Park your car 'neath an August moon
We're on vacation, till the start of the Fall!
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! We're gonna have a ball! Goooooo!
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! Gonna have a ball!
Oh-ho, we'll hop in our jalopy to a drive-in movie
And have a look at the show
We're gonna hug and kiss, just like this
And I can't wait to go-oo-oo
We're gonna mash potato to a jukebox tune
Park your car 'neath an August moon
We're on vacation, till the start of the Fall!
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! We're gonna have a ball!
Yeah! VACATION! Gonna have a ball! (fade)You might also likeEmbed
