19 ContributorsThe Look Lyrics[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Walkin' like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop
She's got the look

Heavenly bound
'Cause heaven's got her number
When she's spinnin' me around
Kissin' is a color
Her lovin' is a wild dog
She's got the look

[Chorus]
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look
You might also like[Verse 2]
Fire in the ice
Naked to the T-bone
Is a lover's disguise
Bangin' on the head drum
Shakin' like a mad bull
She's got the look

Swayin' to the band
Movin' like a hammer
She's a miracle man
Lovin' is the ocean
And kissin' is the wet sand
She's got the look

[Chorus]
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look
Ow!
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 1]
Walkin' like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasted like a raindrop
She's got the look

[Bridge]
And she goes
A-na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
She's got the look

[Chorus]
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look
What in the world
Can make you so blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
