50 ContributorsMargaritaville Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strummin' my six-string on my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil

[Chorus 1]
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault

[Verse 2]
Don't know the reason I stayed here all season
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

[Chorus 2]
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault
[Verse 3]
I blew out my flip-flop, stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home
But there's booze in the blender and soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
You might also like[Chorus 3]
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's my own damn fault

[Outro]
Yes, and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know it's my own damn fault5Embed
