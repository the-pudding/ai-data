4 ContributorsLittle Children LyricsLittle children
You better not tell on me
I'm tellin' you little children
You better not tell what you see

And if you're good
I'll give you candy and a quarter
If you're quiet like you oughta be
And keep a secret with me

I wish they would go away, little children
Now why ain't you playin' outside?
I'm askin' you, you can't fool me
'Cause I'm gonna know if you hide

And try to peek
I'm gonna treat you to a movie
Stop your gigglin', children do be nice
Like little sugars and spice

You saw me kissin' your sister
You saw me holdin' her hand
But if you snitch to your mother
Your father won't understand

I wish they would take a nap, little children
Now why don't you go bye-bye?
Go anywhere, little children
I know you would go if you tried
You might also likeGo up the stairs
Me and your sister, we're goin' steady
How can I kiss her when I'm ready to
With little children like you around?

I wonder what can I do around
Little children like youEmbed
