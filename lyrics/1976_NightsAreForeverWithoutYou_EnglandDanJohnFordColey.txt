4 ContributorsNights Are Forever Without You Lyrics[Verse 1:]
Lying in bed with the radio on
Moonlight falls like rain
Soft summer nights spent
Thinking of you
When will I see you again?

Soft and low the music moans
I can't stop thinking about you
Thinking 'bout you

[Chorus:]
I didn't know it would be so strong
Waiting and wondering about you
I didn't know it would last so long
Nights are forever without you

[Verse 2:]
Curtains still dance
With the wind and the sky
The sun will be coming up soon
But I just can't sleep for thinking of you
Here alone with the moon

Soft and low the music moans
I can't stop thinking about you
Thinking 'bout you
You might also like[Repeat Chorus:]

[Repeat x4:]
Nights are forever without youEmbed
