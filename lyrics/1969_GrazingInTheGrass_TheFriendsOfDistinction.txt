It sure is mellow, grazin' in the grass
(Grazin' in the grass is a gas, baby, can you dig it?)
What a trip just watchin' as the world goes past
(Grazin' in the grass is a gas, baby, can you dig it?)

[Verse 2]
There are so many good things to see, while grazin' in the grass
(Grazin' in the grass is a gas, baby, can you dig it?)
Flowers with colors for takin', everything outta sight, in the grass
(Grazin' in the grass is a gas, baby, can you dig it?)

[Verse 3]
The sun beaming down between the leaves
(Grazin' in the grass is a gas, baby, can you dig it?)
And the bir-ir-ir-irds dartin' in and out of the trees
(Grazin' in the grass is a gas, baby, can you dig it?)

[Refrain]
Everything here is so clear, you can see it
And everything here is so real, you can feel it
And it's real (Rock it to me, sock it to me, rock it to me, sock it to me), so real (Rock it to me, sock it to me), so real (Rock it to me, sock it to me), so real (Rock it to me, sock it to me), so real (Rock it to me, sock it to me), so real (Rock it to me, sock it to me)
Can you dig it?
(Whooo!) (Whooo!)
I can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it, we can dig it, they can dig it, you can dig it
Oh, let's dig it. (Can you dig it, baby?)
I can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it, we can dig it, they can dig it, you can dig it
Oh, let's dig it. (Can you dig it, baby!)

The sun beaming down between the leaves

[Refrain/Outro]
Everything here is so clear, you can see it
