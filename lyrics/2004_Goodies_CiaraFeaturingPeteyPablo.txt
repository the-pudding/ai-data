38 ContributorsGoodies Lyrics[Intro: Ciara]
My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo & Ciara]
I got a sick reputation for handlin' broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more (A few seconds or more)
And it's a wrap, tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put a car right there (Put a car right there)
I'm the truth, and I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody 'cause they seen me do it (They seen me do it)
Barricades? I run right through 'em, used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, I'm used to it (It's no use)
You still won't have a pin-up in a fabulous room
On her back, pickin' out baskets of fruit (I love you, boo)
Yeah, Freak and Petey love you too (Yeah), ha-ha
You know how I do it (That goodie, goodie)

[Verse 2: Ciara]
You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby, this is what I'm lookin' for
Sexy, independent, gotta spend it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not bein' too dramatic, that's the way I gotta have it
You might also like[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies (Ugh)
Bet you thought about it (Yeah)
Got you all hot and bothered (Ow)
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're lookin' for the goodies
Keep on lookin', 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Ciara]
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies, I'm no rookie
If you ain't sexy, independent
I ain't with it, so you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic, that's the way I gotta have it
You may talk slick, tryna hit, but I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic, it's just how I gotta have it

[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies (Ugh)
Bet you thought about it (Yeah)
Got you all hot and bothered (Ow)
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're lookin' for the goodies
Keep on lookin', 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
[Verse 4: Petey Pablo]
So damn hot, but so young (So young)
You ain't got milk on ya tongue, slow down, lil' one
We ain't got long
Hey shorty, you little thing (Wait a minute)
You think you bad but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the bag
I've been workin' at it ever since I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact, let me tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom, bada bam, ba-bam (I'm Bad)

[Verse 5: Ciara]
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies, boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'

[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies (Ugh)
Bet you thought about it (Yeah)
Got you all hot and bothered (Ow)
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're lookin' for the goodies
Keep on lookin', 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
I bet you want the goodies (Ugh)
Bet you thought about it (Yeah)
Got you all hot and bothered (Ow)
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're lookin' for the goodies
Keep on lookin', 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
[Outro: Ciara]
Ugh, yeah, ow, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh9Embed
