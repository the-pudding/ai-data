4 ContributorsIâ€™ll Be There LyricsOver mountains, over trees
Over oceans, over seas
Across the desert, I'll be there
In a whisper on the wind
On the smile of a new friend
Just think of me and I'll be there

Don't be afraid, oh, my love
I'll be watching you from above
And I'd give all the world tonight to be with you
'Cause I'm on your side
And I still care
I may have died but I've gone nowhere
Just think of me and I'll be there

On the edge of a waking dream
Over rivers, over streams
Through wind and rain, I'll be there
Across the wide and open sky
Thousands of miles I'd fly
To be with you, I'll be there

Don't be afraid, oh, my love
I'll be watching you from above
And I'd give all the world tonight to be with you
'Cause I'm on your side
And I still care
I may have died but I've gone nowhere
Just think of me and I'll be there
Just think of me and I'll be there
You might also likeIn the breath of a wind that sighs
Oh, there's no need to cry
Just think of me and I'll be there

Don't be afraid, oh, my love
I'll be watching you from above
And I'd give all the world tonight to be with you
'Cause I'm on your side
And I still care
I may have died but I've gone nowhere
Just think of me, I'll be there
Just think of me, I'll be there
Think of me, I'll be thereEmbed
