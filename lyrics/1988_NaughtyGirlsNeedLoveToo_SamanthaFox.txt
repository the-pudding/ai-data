Maybe
Just maybe
Naughty girls need love too

[Verse 1]
I've been told time and time again
That you can't treat love like a game
But I play rough with hearts that never mend
'Cause some guys like you do the same

[Verse 2]
Love was just a four letter word
Never heard, how absurd
How it could be?
Now, I can't believe this is real
How I feel, now you steal
My heart away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Used to be so good and so bad
Sex was just something I had
Used to always know what to do
Now you've got me confused

[Chorus: Samantha Fox, Full Force]
Baby, don't let me be misunderstood
(Temporary love's so bad) But it feels so good
Then along came you, now I know it's true
Naughty girls need love too
(Then came you, then came you)
You might also like[Verse 3]
Yes, it's true, I'm in love with you
And believe it, baby
This time your love won't get away
Stay here in the place to be
We can get busy my way
For six forevers and a day-ay-ay

[Verse 4]
Ooh, it's only you I adore
So much more than my body was asking for
Yes, your love is breaking my chill
Even still, there's a thrill in my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Samantha Fox, Full Force]
(Samantha Fox is such a wild dame)
Huh, but what's in a name?
(S-S-Samantha, S-S-Samantha Fox)
No more fun and games of the mind
(Let's get busy one time)

[Chorus: Samantha Fox, Full Force]
Baby, don't let me be misunderstood
(Temporary love's so bad) But it feels so good
Then along came you, now I know it's true
Naughty girls need love
(Naughty girls need love)
Baby, don't let me be misunderstood
(Temporary love's so bad) But it feels so good
Then along came you, now I know it's true
Naughty girls need love too

[Bridge: Samantha Fox, Full Force]
Stop moving like you're forty
This groove is much too naughty
Can't you see? I want you just for me
Boys, make some noise

(Girl, I want to shower you with diamonds and)
Please don't tease
If you lie, my heart will freeze
(Freeze, freeze, freeze)

[Outro: Samantha Fox, Full Force]
(Don't let me) Baby
Temporary love's so bad
Temporary love's so bad
Then along came you
Then along came you

Don't, don't
Don't, don't
Temporary, temporary
Temporary, temporary
Then along, then along
Then along, then along
Naughty girls need love
Baby, baby
Don't let me
Temporary love's so bad
Then along came youEmbed
