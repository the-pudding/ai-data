17 ContributorsReflections Lyrics[Intro]
Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

[Chorus]
Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world that's
A distorted reality

[Verse 1]
Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories
Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm cryin'
Reflects a hurt I can't control

[Chorus]
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holdin' on
To the happy times
Ooh, when you were mine
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterday
And all the love I gave all in vain

[Bridge]
(All the love)
All the love that I've wasted
(All the tears)
All the tears that I've tasted
All in vain

[Verse 2]
Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt that you have caused
Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a love that used to be

[Chorus]
In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust
[Post-Chorus]
After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of lovin' you

[Chorus]
Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me
In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust1Embed
