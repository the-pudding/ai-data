Last night I took a walk after dark
A swingin' place called Palisades Park
To have some fun and see what I could see
That's where the girls are

[Verse 2]
I took a ride on a shoot-the-chute
That girl I sat beside was awful cute
After we stopped she was holdin' hands with me
My heart was flyin'

[Bridge]
Up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Back like a loop-the-loop
And around like a merry-go-round

[Verse 3]
We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love

[Chorus]
You'll never know how great a kiss can feel
When you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel
When I fell in love
Down at Palisades Park

[Verse 3]
We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love

[Chorus]
You'll never know how great a kiss can feel
When you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel
When I fell in love
Down at Palisades Park

[Outro]
Down at Palisades Park
You know it's Palisades Park
Down at Palisades Park1Embed
