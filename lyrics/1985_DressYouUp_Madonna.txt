You've got style, that's what all the girls say
Satin sheets and luxuries so fine
All your suits are custom made in London
But I've got something that you'll really like

[Chorus 1]
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

[Verse 2]
Feel the silky touch of my caresses
They will keep you looking so brand new
Let me cover you with velvet kisses
I'll create a look that's made for you

[Chorus 2]
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
(All over your body) All over your body
In my love (All over, all over)
From your head down to your toes

All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love

In my love (All over, all over)
From your head down to your toes
(Gonna dress you up in my love)
Gonna dress you up in my love
