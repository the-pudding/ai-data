4 ContributorsRespect Yourself Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you disrespect everybody
That you run into
How in the world do you think
Anybody's supposed to respect you
If you don't give a heck about the man
With a Bible in his hand, yeah
Just get out the way
And let the gentleman do his thing
You're the kind of gentleman
That wants everything their way, oh
Take the sheet off your face, boy
It's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Oh, respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot, na-na-na, oh-oh
Respect yourself
Respect yourself

[Verse 2]
If you're walking 'round thinking
That the world owes you something 'cause you're here, yeah
You're going out the world backwards
Like you did when you first came here, yeah
You keep talking 'bout the president
Won't stop air pollution, oh
Put your hand over your mouth when you cough
That'll help the solution, yeah
Oh, you cuss around women
And you don't even know their name, oh
Then you're dumb enough to think
That it makes you a big ol' man, yeah-yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot, na-na-na, oh-oh
Respect yourself
Oh, respect yourself

[Outro]
Respect yourself
Respect yourself
Respect yourself
Respect yourself
Respect yourself
Better respect yourself
Respect yourself
Respect yourself
Just respect yourselfEmbed
