Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is all your love?)
Where is the love?

[Verse 1: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]
Where is the love
You said you'd give to me soon as you were free?
Will it ever be?
Where is the love?

[Refrain: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]
You told me that you didn't love him
And you were gonna say goodbye
But if you really didn't mean it
Why did you have to lie?

[Verse 2: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]
Where is the love
You said was mine all mine, 'til the end of time?
Was it just a lie?
Where is the love?

[Refrain: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]
If you had had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so
Don't leave me hangin' on the promises
You've got to let me know

[Bridge: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, Donny Hathaway, Roberta Flack]
Oh, how I wish I never met you
I guess it must have been my fate
To fall in love with someone else's love
All I can do is wait
Wait (That's all I can do, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway]
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is all the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is all the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)Embed
