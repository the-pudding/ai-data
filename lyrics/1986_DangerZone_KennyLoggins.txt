Revvin' up your engine
Listen to her howlin' roar
Metal under tension
Beggin' you to touch and go

[Chorus]
Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into the Danger Zone

[Verse 2]
Headin' into twilight
Spreadin' out her wings tonight
She got you jumpin' off the deck
And shovin' into overdrive

[Chorus]
Highway to the Danger Zone
I'll take you right into the Danger Zone

[Bridge]
You'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

[Verse 3]
Out along the edges
Always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

[Chorus]
Highway to the Danger Zone
Gonna take it right into the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Gonna take it right into the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into the Danger Zone15Embed
