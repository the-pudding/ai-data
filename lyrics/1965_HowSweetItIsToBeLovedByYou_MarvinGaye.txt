How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes baby, ooh-ooh-ooh
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Ooh baby

[Verse 1]
I needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby
I just want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby

[Chorus]
Hey now
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes, it is

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes at night
And wonder where would I be without you in my life
Everything was just a bore
All the things I did, seems I've done 'em before
But you brightened up all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby
I want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, yes, it is
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes, it is baby

[Bridge]
You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop (Stop) and thank you, baby
I just want to stop (Stop) and thank you, baby

[Outro]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Tell the truth, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Well, it's like sugar in my soul
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, yes it is, baby1Embed
