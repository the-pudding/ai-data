4 ContributorsSweet Talkinâ€™ Guy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sweet talkin' guy
Talkin' sweet kinda lies
Don't you believe in him
If you do he'll make you cry
He'll send you flowers
And paint the town with another girl
He's a sweet talkin' guy (Sweet talkin' guy)
But he's my kind of guy (Sweet talkin' guy)

[Verse 2]
Sweeter than sugar
Kisses like wine (Oh, he's so fine)
Don't let him under your skin
'Cause you'll never win (No, you'll never win)
Don't give him love today
Tomorrow he's on his way
He's a sweet talkin' guy (Sweet talkin' guy)
But he's my kind of guy (Sweet talkin' guy)

[Bridge]
Why do I love him like I do?

He's a sweet talkin' (Sweet talkin')
Sweet talkin' (Sweet talkin') guy
You might also like[Verse 3]
(Stay away from him, stay away from him)
Don't believe his lyin'
(No, no, no, you'll never win, no you'll never win)
Don't ever buy in
Don't give him love today
Tomorrow he's on his way
He's a sweet talkin' (Sweet talkin')
Sweet talkin' (Sweet talkin')
Sweet talkin' (Sweet talkin')
Sweet talkin' (Sweet talkin') guy

[Outro]
(Sweet, sweet, sweet talkin' guy) Stay away from him
(Sweet, sweet, sweet talkin' guy) Now, I know
(Sweet, sweet, sweet talkin' guy) I'll never win
(Sweet, sweet, sweet talkin' guy)
(Sweet, sweet, sweet talkin' guy)Embed
