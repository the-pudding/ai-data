She dunno that she's a lucky girl
Got the best thing in the whole wide world
Got a love that's hard to find
Got the boy I wish was mine

[Chorus]
She's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel

[Verse 2]
He dunno it but she cheats on him
With a boy like that, it's such a sin
I would never be untrue
I would never make him blue

[Chorus]
But she's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel

[Verse 3]
I know there's gonna come a day
He will tell the girl, "Be on your way"
Maybe then he'll turn to me
Then how happy I will be
You might also like[Chorus]
That she's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruelEmbed
