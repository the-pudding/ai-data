62 ContributorsTubthumping Lyrics[Spoken Interlude: Danny from "Brassed Off"]
Truth is, I thought it mattered
I thought that music mattered
But does it? Bollocks!
Not compared to how people matter

[Intro: Chumbawamba]
We'll be singin'
When we're winnin'
We'll be singin'

[Chorus: Chumbawamba]
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

[Verse 1: Dunstan Bruce & Lou Watts]
Pissin' the night away, pissin' the night away
He drinks a Whiskey drink, he drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a Lager drink, he drinks a Cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times
Oh, Danny Boy, Danny Boy, Danny Boy

You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

[Verse 2: Dunstan Bruce & Lou Watts]
Pissin' the night away, pissin' the night away
He drinks a Whiskey drink, he drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a Lager drink, he drinks a Cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times
Don't cry for me, next-door neighbour

[Chorus: Chumbawamba]
