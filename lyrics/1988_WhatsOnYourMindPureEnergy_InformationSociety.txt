12 ContributorsWhatâ€™s on Your Mind (Pure Energy) Lyrics[Intro]
It's worked so far, but we're not out yet

I wanna know what you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know what you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

Pure energy
Pure energy

[Verse 1]
Here I am in silence looking 'round without a clue
I find myself alone again all alone with you
I can see behind your eyes the things that I don't know
If you hide away from me how can our love grow?

[Chorus]
I wanna know what you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know what you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

[Verse 2]
I know I could break you down but what good would it do?
I could surely never know that what you say is true
Here I am in silence it's a game I have to play
You and I in silence with nothing else to say
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna know what you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know what you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

[Bridge]

Pure energy
Destruction
Pure energy
Destruction
Pure energy
Destruction
Pure energy
Destruction
Pure energy

[Chorus]
I wanna know what you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know what you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

I wanna know what you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know what you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind3Embed
