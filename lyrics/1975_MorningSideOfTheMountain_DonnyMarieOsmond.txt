[Donny:] There was a boy
[Donny:]
There was a girl, there was a boy
If they had met they might have found a world of joy
But he lived on the morning side of the mountain
And she lived on the twilight side of the hill
[Marie:]
They never met, they never kissed
They will never know what happiness they've missed
'Cause he lived on the morningside of the mountain
And she lived on the twilight side of the hill
Both:
For love's a rose that never grows
Without the kiss of the morning dew
And every Jack must have a Jill
To know the thrill of a dream that comes true
[Donny:]
And you and I are just like they
For all we know our love is just a kiss away
[Marie:]
But you are on the morning side of the mountain
[Donny:]
And you are on the twilight side of the hill
Both:
And you and I are just like they
For all we know our love is just a kiss away
[Marie:]
But you are on the morning side of the mountain
[Donny:]
And you are on the twilight side of the hill
[Marie:]
There was a girl...
[Donny:]
There was a boy...You might also likeEmbed
