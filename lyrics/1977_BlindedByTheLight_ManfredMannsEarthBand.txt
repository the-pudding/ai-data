Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

[Verse 1]
Madman, drummers, bummers
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps
As the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older
I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'
The calliope crashed to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
The calliope crashed to the ground!

[Chorus]
But, she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Some silicone sister with a manager mister
Told me I got what it takes
She said, "I'll turn you on, son, into something strong
Play the song with the funky break"
And go-kart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Asked me if I needed a ride!

[Chorus]
But, she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light

[Breakdown]
She got down but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night
She's gonna make it through the night

[Instrumental Break 02:54-04:09]
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
But mama, that's where the fun is
But mama, that's where the fun is
Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
Some brimstone, baritone, anticyclone, rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone
That's where they expect it least"
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner
Watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone
Was messin' with his frozen zone reminding him of romance

[Pre-Chorus]
The calliope crashed to the ground!

[Chorus]
But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
[Counter Chorus]
(Madman drummers, bummers)
Blinded by the light
(Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(In the dumps with the mumps)
Blinded by the light
(As the adolescent pumps his way into his hat)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(With a boulder on my shoulder, feeling kinda older)
Blinded by the light
(I tripped the merry-go-round)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin')
Blinded by the light
(The calliope crashed to the ground)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Now, Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(And throws his lover in the sand)
Blinded by the light
(Some bloodshot forget-me-not said daddy's within earshot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Save the buckshot, turn up the band)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Some silicone sister with a manager mister)
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Told me I got what it takes)
(She said, "I'll turn you on, son, into something strong")

[Outro]
She got down, but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night27Embed
