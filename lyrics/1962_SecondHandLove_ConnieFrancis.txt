2 ContributorsSecond Hand Love LyricsThey tell me that there's someone else you really, truly, love
And even when we kiss, that she's the one you're thinking of

I guess it's true, cause once or twice, you called me by her name
I need you so, but now I know, that you don't feel the same

It's all over town, you put me down
A second-hand love, a second-hand love

Though late at night, I sit alone and count the tears that fall
I'd rather have this kind of love, then not see you at all

My friends all say, I'm better off, if we should drift apart
But everyday, I hope and pray, I'll be first in your heart

It's all over town, you put me down
I'm a second-hand love, a second-hand love
Just a second-hand love, a second-hand loveYou might also likeEmbed
