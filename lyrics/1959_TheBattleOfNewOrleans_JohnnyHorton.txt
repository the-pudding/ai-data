In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town near New Orleans

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 2]
We looked down a river and we see'd the British come
(Hut-two three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drums
(Hut-two three-four)
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
(Hut-two three-four)
We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing
(Hut-two three-four)

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets 'til we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire 'til we see their faces well
(Hut, two-three-four)
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we

[Chorus]
Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
(One-hup-two, hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two, hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(Hup-two, one-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)
[Verse 5]
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
(One-hup-two, hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two, hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(Hup-two, one-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)
(Sound off three-four)
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)
(Sound off three-four)
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)
(Sound off three-four)1Embed
