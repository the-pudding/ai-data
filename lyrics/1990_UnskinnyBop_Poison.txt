10 ContributorsUnskinny Bop Lyrics[Verse 1]
A-what's got you so jumpy?
Why can't you sit still, yeah?
Like gasoline, you wanna pump me
And leave me when you get your fill, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I touch you, honey, you get hot
I wanna make love, you never stop
Come up for air, you pull me to the floor
What's been going on in that head of yours?

[Chorus]
Unskinny bop
Just blows me away, yeah
Unskinny bop, bop
All night and day, yeah
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
She just loves to play, yeah
Unskinny bop, nothin' more to say

[Verse 2]
You look at me so funny
Love bite got you acting oh so strange
You got too many bees in your honey
Am I just another word in your page, yeah, yeah?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I touch you, honey, you get hot
I wanna make love, you never stop
Come up for air, you pull me to the floor
What's been going on in that head of yours?

[Chorus]
Unskinny bop
Just blows me away, yeah
Unskinny bop, bop
All night and day, yeah
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
She just loves to play, yeah
Unskinny bop, nothin' more to say

[Verse 3]
You're saying my love won't do ya
That ain't love written on your face
Well, honey, I can see right through ya
Well, who's ridin' who at the end of the race?

[Bridge]
What's right?
What's wrong?
What's left?
What the hell is going on?
[Chorus]
Unskinny bop
Just blows me away, yeah
Unskinny bop, bop
All night and day, yeah
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
She just loves to play, yeah
(Up for air, pulled to the floor)
Unskinny bop
No good, no good, no good, no good
Unskinny bop, bop
All night and day, yeah
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
No good, no good, no good, no goodEmbed
