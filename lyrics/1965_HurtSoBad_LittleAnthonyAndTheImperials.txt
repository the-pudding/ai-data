4 ContributorsHurt So Bad Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know you
Don't know what I'm going through
Standing here
Looking at you

[Chorus]
Well, let me tell you that it
(Hurt) Hurts so bad (Hurts so bad)
(Hurt) It makes me feel so sad (Hurt, hurts so bad)
(Hurt) It makes me hurt so bad (Hurt, hurts so bad)
To see you again

[Verse 2]
Like needles and pins, people say
You've been making out okay
She's in love, don't stand in her way

[Chorus]
But let me tell you that it
(Hurt) Hurts so bad (Hurts so bad)
It makes me feel so sad (Hurt, hurts so bad)
It's gonna hurt so bad (Hurt, hurts so bad)
If you walk away

[Bridge]
Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
(Stay) I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before
Please love me again
I can't let you go back to him
