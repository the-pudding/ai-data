Hoo hoo hoo yeah

[Verse 1: Peter Cetera]
You are my love in my life
And you are my inspiration
Just you and me
Simple and free
Baby, you're everything I've ever dreamed of
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Peter Cetera]
Give me your own special smile
Promise you'll never leave me
Just you and me
Simple and free
Life is so easy
When you're beside me
Oh girl

[Chorus: Peter Cetera, with bandmates]
Come hold me close
Yeah, never release me
(Oh baby don't release me)
Open your arms, let my love in
(Let me in, let me in, let me in)
Love me tonight
Yeah
Love me forever
And ever
