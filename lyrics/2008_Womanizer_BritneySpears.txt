Superstar, where you from? How's it goin'?
I know you got a clue what you're doin'
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you, gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

[Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
(You, you) You got me goin', you're oh-so-charmin'
(You, you) But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
(You, you) You say I'm crazy, I got your crazy
(You, you) You're nothin' but a womanizer

Daddy-o, you got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many
Makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me, you're the sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna
But no way, I'm never gonna
Fall for you, never you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are (Womanizer, womanizer)
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

[Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
(You, you) You got me goin', you're oh-so-charmin'
(You, you) But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
(You, you) You say I'm crazy, I got your crazy
(You, you) You're nothin' but a womanizer
[Bridge]
Maybe if we both lived in a different world, yeah
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)
It would be all good and maybe I could be your girl (Yeah)
But I can't 'cause we don't, you

[Pre-Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are (Womanizer, womanizer)
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

[Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
(You, you) You got me goin', you're oh-so-charmin'
(You, you) But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
(You, you) You say I'm crazy, I got your crazy
(You, you) You're nothin' but a womanizer

[Outro]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby31Embed
