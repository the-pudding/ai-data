Eli's comin'
Eli's comin' (Eli's a-comin')
Well, you better hide your heart
Your loving heart
Eli's a-comin', and the cards say
A broken heart

[Chorus]
Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide (Your heart)
Girl, Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl (Hide it)
You better, better hide your heart
Eli's comin', better walk, walk

[Verse]
But you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away
From the burnin' heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay
Everywhere I go, though
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin', and he's comin' to get ya
(She walked, but, she walked, but)
Get down on your knees
(She walked, but she never got away)

Walk but you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away
From the burnin' heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay
Everywhere I go, though
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she'll never get away)
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she'll never get away)
Eli's a-comin', and he's comin' to get ya

Get down on your knees
