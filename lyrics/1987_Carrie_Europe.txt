When lights go down
I see no reason
For you to cry
We've been through this before
In every time
In every season
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more

[Bridge: Joey Tempest]
Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye

[Chorus: Joey Tempest]
Carrie, Carrie
Things they change, my friend, whoa
Carrie, Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Somewhere again

[Verse 2: Joey Tempest]
I read your mind
With no intentions
Of being unkind
I wish I could explain
It all takes time
A whole lot of patience
If it's a crime
How come I feel no pain?

Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus: Joey Tempest]
Carrie, Carrie
Oh, things they change, my friend, whoa
Carrie, Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again

[Instrumental]

[Bridge: Joey Tempest]
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye, oh (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus: Joey Tempest]
Carrie, Carrie
Oh, things they change
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie
Carrie, Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Oh, somewhere again

[Outro: Joey Tempest]
