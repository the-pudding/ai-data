6 ContributorsThe Goonies ‘R’ Good Enough Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here we are
Hanging onto strains of greed and blues
Break the chain then we break down
Oh, it's not real if you don't feel it
Unspoken expectations
Ideals you used to play with
They've finally taken shape for us

[Chorus]
What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now you'll say
You're startin' to feel the push and pull
Of what could be and never can
You mirror me stumblin' through those

[Pre-Chorus]
Old fashioned superstitions
I find too hard to break
Oh, maybe you're out of place
See Cyndi Lauper LiveGet tickets as low as $100You might also like[Chorus]
What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Good Enough) for you
Is good enough for me
It's good, it's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Old fashioned superstitions
I find too hard to break
Oh maybe you're out of place

[Chorus]
What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Good Enough) for you
Is good enough for me
It's good, it's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[Outro]
