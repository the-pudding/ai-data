6 ContributorsSave Your Heart for Me Lyrics[Intro]
*whistling*

[Verse 1]
Walk along the lake with someone new
Have yourself a summer fling or two
But remember I'm in love with you
And save your heart for me

[Verse 2]
When the summer moon is on the rise
And you're dancin' under starlit skies
Please don't let the stars get in your eyes
Just save your heart for me

[Bridge]
When you're all alone, far away from home
Someone's gonna flirt with you
I won't think it's wrong if you play along
Just don't fall for someone new

[Verse 3]
When the autumn winds begin to blow
And the summertime is long ago
You'll be in my arms again I know
So, save your heart for me
Darlin', save your heart for me

[Outro]
Please remember I'm in love with you so
Save your heart for me
Darlin', save your heart for meEmbed
