Question
Lucy Liu, With my girl Drew, Cameron D. and Destiny
With Charlie's Angels, come on
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I’m feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
The shoes on my feet (I bought ’em)
The clothes I'm wearing (I bought 'em)
The rock I'm rocking (I bought it)
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (I bought it)
The house I live in (I bought it)
The car I'm driving (I bought it)
I depend on me, I depend on me

(Every project, come on, come on)
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin', won't you say what's on your mind?
'Cause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
But when I ask you, "What's the deal?", you hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
Boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love, it's all here for you, oh-yeah

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home, you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Bug a Boo
[Intro: Beyoncé]
(Bug a Boo)
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me

(You make me wanna throw my pager out the window)
(Tell MCI to cut the phone poles)
(Break my lease so I can move)
('Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo)

I'm sorry, hold up, stop the music
Stop
I thought I was in LA
Where am I tonight?
Where am I tonight?
That's more like it
I'm gonna do something special for y'all
If you don't know I'm from Houston Texas
And I know Destiny's Child is known for singing real fast
Sometimes you gotta go home and listen to the record over and over again to understand what they're saying
So I'm gonna do something special
I'm gonna [?] this one, slow it down for you
Nice and easy
Are you ready?
1, 2, 3

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?

Listen

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
It's not hot
That you be callin' me, stressin' me, pagin' my beeper
You're just non-stop
And it's not hot
That you be leavin' me messages every 10 minutes
And then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full

Take me to Utah
Ha ha
(You make me wanna throw my pager out the window)
Uhu, hey
(Tell MCI to cut the phone poles)
(Break my lease so I can move)
('Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo)
Keep it going now, hey
(I wanna put your number on the call block)
Hey hey, oh oh
(Have AOL make my emails stop)
Hey hey, oh oh
('Cause you a bug a boo)
You're buggin me what? Hey
(You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?)
Hey hey hey
('Cause you a bug a boo)
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Bills, Bills, Bills
[Verse 1 and 2: Beyoncé]
At first, we started out real cool
Takin' me places I ain't never been
But now, you're gettin' comfortable
Ain't doin' those things you did no more
You're slowly makin' me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And then you use my what? (Phone)
Callin' whoever that you think's at home
And then, when the bill comes
All of a sudden, you be actin' dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than once

Sing it y'all

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
(Can you pay my bills?)
(Can you pay my telephone bills?)
(Do you pay my automo' bills?)
(If you did, then maybe we could chill)
Sing it
(I don't think you do)
So what?
(So, you and me are through)
(Can you pay my bills?)
(Can you pay my telephone bills?)
Pay 'em
(Do you pay my automo' bills?)
Pay 'em
(If you did, then maybe we could chill)
Pay 'em
(I don't think you do)
So what?
(So, you and me are through)

Cater 2 U
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Baby, I see you workin' hard, I wanna let you know I'm proud
Let you know that I admire what you do
Don't know if I need to reassure you
My life would be purposeless without you (Yeah)
If I want it (Got it) when I ask you (You provide it)
You inspire me to be better (Ooh)
You challenge me for the better (Ooh)
Baby, sit back and let me pour out my love letter
Let me help you take off your shoes
Untie your shoestrings, take off your cuff links (Yeah)
What you wanna eat, boo? (Yeah), let me feed you
Let me run your bathwater (whatever your desire, I'll supply ya)
Sing you a song, turn the game on
I'll brush your hair, help you put your durag on
Want a foot-rub? (Yeah, yeah), you want a manicure?
Baby, I'm yours, I wanna cater to you, boy

Sing it ya'll

[Chorus:]
(Let me cater to you, 'cause, baby, this is your day)
(Do anything for my man, baby, you blow me away)
(I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more)
(Anything you want, just let me cater to you)
(Inspire me from the heart, can't nothin' tear us apart)
(You're all I want in a man, I put my life in your hands)
(I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more)
(Anything you want, I wanna cater to you)

Say My Name
[Chorus:]
(Say my name, say my name)
(If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you")
(If you ain't runnin' game)
(Say my name, say my name)
(You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby")
(Why the sudden change?)
(Say my name, say my name)
(If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you")
(If you ain't runnin' game)
(Say my name, say my name)
(You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby")
(Better say my name)

[Verse 1+2: Beyoncé]
Any other day I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "Uh-huh, yeah, okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
Baby why, why you got to lie?
I'm all up in your game boy, you better say my name

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange)
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my, say my, say my name
Say my, say my, say my name, boy say my name

Hey, say, Beyoncé (Beyoncé)
(Say Beyoncé)
Say Beyoncé (Say Beyoncé)
Say Beyoncé (say my name)
Say

Jumpin', Jumpin'
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ladies (ladies)
I said ladies
(Ladies, leave your man at home)
Why?
(The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown)
So mama's
(And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends)
'Cause it's eleven thirty
'Cause it's eleven thirty
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin'

(Ladies, leave your man at home)
(The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown)
(And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends)
('Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin')
Y'all think you can find me a second man out here?
(Girl you know I got you B, okay)
([?]Here the front row, with the black shirt on girl, he is what)

What about in the middle [?]?
(Allright girl, I found someone nice and tall, right here in the front)
Oh yes, he is what?
Wonderfulicious
What about over here?
(Oh I see right there with the black shirt on on the right, girl)
Oh right I see him, hey baby

What about my ladies? Ladies

[Interlude: Beyoncé]
Bounce ba-ba-bounce, ba-bounce ba-bounce
Shake, baby, shake sh sh shake sh shake
Twist baby, twist twist twist twist twist
One more time, let me see you bounce

Shake, sh sh shake sh shake
Twist baby, twist twist twist twist twist
Dip that thang
Baby let me see you bounce, bounce bounce

Don't mind takin' one for me (Where they at?)

Wouldn't mind puttin' that on me (Where they at?)

Survivor
Where my survivors at? Where my survivors at? Where my survivors at?

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions
What?

[Chorus:]
(I'm a survivor)
If you are a survivor, raise up
(I'm not gon' give up)
If you survived any [?]
(I'm not gon' stop)
If you survived sex [?]
(I'm gon' work harder)
If you survived racism
(I'm a survivor)
If you survived [?] in your family
(I'm gonna make it)
If you survived [?]
(I will survive)
I want you to put up your fist and celebrate with me tonight
(Keep on survivin')
Yeah
(I'm a survivor)

I don't wanna celebrate by myself, I wanna bring out Kelly and Michelle
Is that allright with y'all?

[Beyoncé, Kelly & Michelle]

I'm gon' work harder
