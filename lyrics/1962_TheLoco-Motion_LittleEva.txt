25 ContributorsThe Loco-Motion Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Everybody's doin' a brand new dance, now
(Come on, baby, do the Loco-Motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(Come on, baby, do the Loco-Motion)
My little baby sister can do it with me
It's easier than learnin' your ABCs
So come on, come on
Do the Loco-Motion with me

[Chorus]
You gotta swing your hips, now
Come on, baby
Jump up, jump back
Well, I think you've got the knack
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now
(Come on, baby, do the Loco-Motion)
A chugga-chugga motion like a railroad train, now
(Come on, baby, do the Loco-Motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Come on, come on
Do the Loco-Motion with me
[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Move around the floor in a Loco-Motion
(Come on, baby, do the Loco-Motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion
(Come on, baby, do the Loco-Motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feelin' blue
So come on, come on
Do the Loco-Motion with me

[Outro]
(Come on, do the Loco-Motion) You gotta swing your hips, now (Come on, do the Loco-Motion) That's right
You're doin' fine (come on, do the Loco-Motion)
Come on, baby (come on, do the Loco-Motion)
Mm, jump up, jump back (come on, do the Loco-Motion)
