1 ContributorThe Best Things in Life Are Free (Classic 7" with Rap) Lyrics[Intro: Janet Jackson]
Are you ready? Woo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dah dah
The best things in life are free, yeah
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dah dah
Free, baby

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson & Luther Vandross]
Boy, when you look at me
Do you judge me by my cover?
Got to be kiddin' me
To think that I'm that kind of lover
I don't mean to disagree
Sorry, you can't buy my kisses
Open your eyes and see
True love comes for free
I'm keepin' my heart open
Hopin' you won't stab me in it
'Cause I've been in love before
And when I had to pay I didn't
I'd lose my sanity
Tryin' to measure your intentions
What do you want from me?
How much will it be?

[Pre-Chorus: Janet Jackson & Luther Vandross]
No more than you're willin' to give (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you won't pay nothin' for this good lovin' (Alright)
It's for free
And I won't make you promises
I'll just do all I can
To be your lover 'cause I understand

You said it twice, I'll say it thrice
My baby, baby, baby
I've got so much love for you (Yeah, yeah)
And it's easy to give it

[Verse 3: Michael Bivins, Ronnie DeVoe, Ralph Tresvant]
Sister sister kickin' all that jazz (Yeah)
You funny, honey, want what you never had
A lot of bone structure, I can make it last
A minute to win it, I deep fill the past
Yeah, material, imperial, so get the info
You know, I know, it's not about the dough
So maybe baby, if you want to be my lady
I'll forget the riches and the other itches
Mo' money, mo' money, Jam & Lewis here we go
Mo' money, mo' money, Luther, Janet here we go
Mo' money, mo' money, Biv, DeVoe, here we go, Ralph T
The best things in life are for free

[Bridge: Janet Jackson, Luther Vandross, Both]
(Mhm) Free, baby (Yeah)
No more than you're willin' to give (Willin' to give)
'Cause you won't pay me nothin' for this good lovin'
It's for free
And I won't make you promises
You see, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, we're gonna be, I'm gonna do
The very best I can
To be your lover 'cause I understand
[Chorus: Janet Jackson & Luther Vandross, Luther Vandross]
The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
Now, hold it, hold it, wait a minute
I still don't think they've got it
Let's tell 'em one more time, check it out
Everybody needs to know that
The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other, the best things in life are free
The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other, the best things in life are freeEmbed
