17 ContributorsPhotograph Lyrics[Chorus]
Every time I see your face, it reminds me of the places
We used to go
But all I've got is a photograph, and I realise you're not
Comin' back anymore

[Verse 1]
I thought I'd make it
The day you went away
But I can't make it
'Til you come home again to stay

[Chorus]
I can't get used to livin' here while my heart is broke
My tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold as the years go by
And we grow old and grey

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now you're expecting me to live without you
But that's not something
That I'm lookin' forward to

[Chorus]
I can't get used to living here while my heart is broke
My tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold as the years go by
And we grow old and grey

Every time I see your face, it reminds me of the places
We used to go
But all I've got is a photograph, and I realise you're not
Comin' back anymore
Every time I see your face, it reminds me of the places
We used to go
But all I've got is a photograph, and I realise you're not
Comin' back anymore
Every time I see your face, it reminds me of the places
We used to go
But all I've got is a photograph, and I realise you're not
Comin' back anymore3Embed
