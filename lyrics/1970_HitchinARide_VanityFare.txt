A thumb goes up, a car goes by
It's nearly 1 AM and here am I
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home by the mornin' light

[Verse 2]
I've got no fare to ride a train
I'm nearly drownin' in the pourin' rain
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home to my baby's side

[Chorus]
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride

[Verse 3]
Long-distance call I got today
She sounded lonely, so I'm on my way
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home, keep her satisfied

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride

A thumb goes up, a car goes by
Oh, won't somebody stop and help a guy
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Been away too long from my baby's side

[Chorus]
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride

[Outro]
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride1Embed
