Climb up way up high
Climb up way up high

Well a well a well a
Heavenly angel I want you for my girl
When I kissed your sweet sweet lips
I knew that you were out of this world

CHORUS
I'll build a stairway to heaven
I'll climb to the highest star
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are

Well a well a well a
Over the rainbow
That's where I'm going to climb
Way up high where the bluebirds fly
I'm going to love you all the time

CHORUS (x2)

Well a well a well a
I got to be going
Going to leave the world behind
Every day in a heavenly way
You're going to drive me out of my mind
You might also likeCHORUS

I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are
