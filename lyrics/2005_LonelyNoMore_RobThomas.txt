28 ContributorsLonely No More Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now it seems to me that you know just what to say
But words are only words
Can you show me something else?
Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way?
Show me how you feel
More than ever, baby

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this (Whoa)
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
(Whoa, oh, whoa)

Now it's hard for me
With my heart still on the mend
Open up to me, like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me and it's harmony
Girl, what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything, just to get you back again
Why can't we just try?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this (Whoa)
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this (Whoa)
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
[Bridge]
What if I was good to you?
What if you were good to me?
What if I could hold you 'till I feel you move inside me?
And what if it was paradise? (Paradise)
And what if we were symphonies?
What if I gave my all my life to find some way to stand beside you?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this (Whoa)
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
But you know I could never stand for this (Whoa)
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
(Whoa, oh, oh, whoa)
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
[Outro]
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore9Embed
