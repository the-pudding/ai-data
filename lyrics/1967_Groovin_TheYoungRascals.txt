[Chorus 1]
Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

[Verse 1]
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of

[Chorus 2]
Movin' down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do

[Verse 2]
There's always lots of things that we can see
We can be anyone we like to be
And all those happy people we could meet just

[Chorus 1]
Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
No, no, no, no
[Bridge]
You might also like[Verse 3]
We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly
[Chorus]
Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away to soon
No, no, no, no
[Outro]
Groovin' (uh huh, uh huh)
