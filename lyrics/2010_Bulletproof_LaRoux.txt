40 ContributorsBulletproof Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

[Chorus]
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

[Verse 2]
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt
You might also like[Chorus]
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

[Bridge]
This time I'll be bulletproof
This time I'll be bulletproof

[Chorus]
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
(This time, baby, this time, baby, this time, baby, this time)
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
(This time, baby, this time, baby, this time, baby, this time)22Embed
