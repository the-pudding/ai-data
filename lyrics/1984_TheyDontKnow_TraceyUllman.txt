10 ContributorsThey Donâ€™t Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've been around for such a long time now
Oh, maybe I could leave you, but I don't know how
And why should I be lonely every night
When I can be with you
Oh, yes, you make it right

[Chorus 1]
And I don't listen to the guys who say
That you're bad for me and I should turn you away
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love

[Verse 2]
I get a feeling when I look at you
Wherever you go now, I wanna be there too
They say we're crazy but I just don't care
And if they keep on talking still they get nowhere

[Chorus 2]
So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you, when you hold my hand
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love

[Bridge]
Why should it matter to us if they don't approve
We should just take our chances
While we've got nothing to lose

[Verse 3: Tracey Ullman, Kirsty MacColl]
Baby!
There's no need for living in the past
Now I've found good loving, gonna make it last
I tell the others "don't bother me"
Cause when they look at you
They don't see what I see

[Chorus 3]
No, I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love

No, I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love

No, I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of loveEmbed
