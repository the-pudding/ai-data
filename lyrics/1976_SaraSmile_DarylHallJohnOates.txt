18 ContributorsSara Smile Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby hair, with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight

[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on
You come and hold me
It's you and me forever

[Chorus]
Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara

[Verse 2]
If you feel like leaving, you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow
If you want to be free
You know all you got to do is say so

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on
I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever
You might also like[Chorus]
Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara
Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile, Sara

[Outro]
Smile awhile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara
Oh, smile awhile
Won't you laugh, Sara
Thank you for making me feel like a man
Not keeping me crazy, crazy
Smile awhile3Embed
