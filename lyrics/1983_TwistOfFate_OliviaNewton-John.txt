10 ContributorsTwist of Fate Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do we deserve a second chance?
How did we fall into this circumstance?
We weren't so straight and narrow
This is much more than we deserve
A higher voice has called the tune
Two hearts that lost the beat will now resume
The gift of life extension
By divine intervention

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
Telling me to get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we've found
The second time around

[Verse 2]
Don't understand what's going on
Woke up this morning, all the hurt was gone
This is a new beginning
I'm back in the land of the living
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
And I gotta get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we found
The second time around

[Bridge]
Oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
Oh, I'm gonna get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we found
The second time around

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
Know I gotta get it right
I'm gonna get it right this time
Life (Life) doesn't mean a thing
(Doesn't mean a thing)
Without the love you bring
Love is what we found
(What we found)
The second time around
[Outro]
It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait

Life (Life) doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we found...1Embed
