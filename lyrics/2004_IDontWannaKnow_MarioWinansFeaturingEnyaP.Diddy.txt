Hold up, let me answer my phone
Some bitch callin' me about some bullshit probably
I'ma call you right back, I'm doin' this mixtape right now
Now back to what I was sayin'...
I just can't believe this, man
It's just another night of these thoughts
Can't get this out of my head
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mario Winans]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby
I don't wanna know
Oh, oh, baby
[Verse 2: Mario Winans]
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself
You might also like[Chorus: Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby
I don't wanna know

[Bridge: Mario Winans]
Did he touch you better than me? (Touch you better than me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (Watch you fall asleep, baby)
Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me? (Oh, do to me, baby)
If you're better off that way (Better off that way)
Baby, all that I can say (All that I can say)
Just gonna do your thing and don't come back to me
(Oh, stay away from me, baby)
[Verse 3: Diddy]
I don't wanna know where your whereabouts or how you're movin'
I know when you in the house or when you're cruisin' (That's right)
It's been proven, my love you're abusin'
And I can't understand how a man got you choosin' (Yeah)
Undecided, I came and provided
My undivided, you came and denied it (Why?)
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin' (I know when you lyin')
Don't even do that, I know why you cryin' (Stop cryin')
I'm not applyin' no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go)
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe
Gave you extra cheese (C'mon), put you in the SUV
You wanted ice so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the West Indies (That's right)
Now it's time you invest in me
'Cause if not, then it's best you leave
Holla, yeah
[Chorus: Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know15Embed
