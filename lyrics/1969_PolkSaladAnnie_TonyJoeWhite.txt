Uh!
If some of ya'll never been down south too much
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and
The fields
Looks somethin' like a turnip green
Everybody calls it polk salad
Polk salad
Uh!
Used to know a girl lived down there
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause that's about all they had to eat
They did alright

[Verse 1]
And down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

[Chorus]
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her momma was a-workin' on the chain gang
(A mean, vicious woman) Uh!
You might also like[Verse 2]
Every day 'for suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad
Carry it home in a tote sack

[Chorus]
Polk salad Annie
The gators got your granny, chomp, chomp, chomp
Everybody says it was a shame
'Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman, heh-heh)
(Lord, have mercy, pick a mess of it)

[Harmonica Solo]
Uh!

[Verse 3]
Her daddy was lazy and no 'count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons
Out of my truck patch

[Chorus]
Polk salad Annie
The gators got your granny, woah ooh-hoo
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her momma was a-workin' on the chain gang
[Outro]
(Sock a little polk salad to me
You know I need a mean mess of it)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Good God
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh-uh!
Got to have me
Ate her up, heh2Embed
