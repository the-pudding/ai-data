10 ContributorsShotgun Lyrics[Chorus]
I said, shotgun!
Shoot 'em 'fore they run, now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the dirty now
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Put on your red dress
And then you go downtown, now
I said, buy yourself a shotgun, now
We're going to break it down, baby, now
We're going to load it up, baby, now
Then you shoot 'em 'fore they run, now

[Chorus]
I said, shotgun!
Shoot 'em 'fore they run, now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the dirty now
Hey

[Chorus]
I said, shotgun!
Shoot 'em 'fore they run, now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the dirty now
Hey

Put on your high heel shoes
I said we're going down here listen to 'em play the blues
We're gonna dig potatoes
We're gonna pick tomatoes

[Chorus]
I said, shotgun!
Shoot 'em 'fore they run, now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the dirty now
Hey

[Outro]
I said it's twine time
I said it's twine time
I said it's twine time
Hey, what did I say?Embed
