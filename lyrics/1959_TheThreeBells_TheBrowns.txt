8 ContributorsThe Three Bells (Les Trois Cloches) LyricsThere's a village, hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees, half forlorn
And there, on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the song that they were singing
Was for baby Jimmy Brown

Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love."

There's a village, hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love

All the chapel bells were ringing
'Twas a great day in his life
Cause the song that they were singing
Was for Jimmy and his wife
You might also likeThen the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation
Bless, O Lord, this celebration
May their lives be filled with love."

From the village, hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to Heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away
Just one lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
'Twas farewell that it was singing
To our good old Jimmy Brown

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation
May his soul find the salvation
Of thy great eternal love."Embed
