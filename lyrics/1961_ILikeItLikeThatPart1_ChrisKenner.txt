Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is (I Like It Like That)

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place (I Like It Like That)

[Verse 1]
They got a little place across the track
The name of the place is I Like It Like That
Now, you take Sally, and I'll take Sue
And we're gonna rock away all of our blues

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is (I Like It Like That)

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
I wanna show you (Come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place (I Like It Like That)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Now, the last time I was down there I lost my shoes
They had some cat shoutin' the blues
The people was yellin' out for more
And all they were sayin' was "Go, man, go"

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place (I Like It Like That)

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is (I Like It Like That)

[Outro]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Come on (Come on)Embed
