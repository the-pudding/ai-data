14 ContributorsAs Tears Go By Lyrics[Verse 1]
It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me
I sit and watch
As tears go by

[Verse 2]
My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch
As tears go by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doing things I used to do
They think are new
I sit and watch
