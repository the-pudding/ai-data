I'm glad you're home
Now, did you really miss me?
I guess
You did by the look in your eyes
Look in your eyes, look in your eyes
Well, lay back and relax
While I put away the dishes
Put away the dishes
Then you and me
Can rock-a-bye

[Chorus]
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell

[Verse 2]
The night is young
And full of possibilities
Well, come on
And let yourself be free!
My love for you
So long I've been saving
Tonight was made
For me and you
You might also like[Chorus]

You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
