And when I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood
It's in the hands of my love
And my love does it good

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa
My love does it good

[Verse 2]
And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood
It's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa
My love does it good

[Bridge]
Oh oh, I love, oh oh, my love
Only my love holds the other key to me
Oh oh, my love, oh oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa
My love does it good

[Verse 3]
Don't ever ask me why
I never say goodbye to my love
It's understood
It's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good, whoa!

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa
My love does it good

[Outro]
Oh-oh, I love, oh-oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa5Embed
