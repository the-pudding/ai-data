Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

[Post-Chorus: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird, I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so—

[Chorus: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

[Post-Chorus: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Home (Home), home and dry
Like a homing bird, I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Chorus: John Lennon, John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison, Paul McCartney & George Harrison & Paul McCartney]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Ooh
