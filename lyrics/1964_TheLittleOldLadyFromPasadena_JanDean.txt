5 ContributorsThe Little Old Lady from Pasadena Lyrics[Intro]
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

[Verse 1]
The little old lady from Pasadena
(Go granny, go granny, go granny go)
Has a pretty little flower bed of white gardenias
(Go granny, go granny, go granny go)
But parked in her rickety old garage
Is a brand new shiny red Super Stock Dodge

[Chorus]
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

[Refrain]
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

[Verse 2]
If you see her on the street don't try to choose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny go)
You might drive a goer but you'll never lose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny go)
Well, she's gonna get a ticket now sooner or later
Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator
You might also like[Chorus]
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's a terror of Colorado Boulevard

[Refrain]
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

[Harmonica Solo]
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
[Harmonica Solo]
Go granny, go granny, go granny go

[Verse 3]
The guys come to race her from miles around
But she'll give 'em a length then she'll shut 'em down

[Chorus]
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's a terror out on Colorado Boulevard

[Refrain]
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
[Outro with Harmonica Solo]
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Granny go
Go granny, go granny, go granny go
Granny goEmbed
