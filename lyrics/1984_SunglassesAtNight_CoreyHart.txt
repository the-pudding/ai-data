I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
Watch you weave then breathe your story lines
And I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
Keep track of the visions in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
While she's deceiving me
It cuts my security
Has she got control of me?
I turn to her and say

[Chorus]
Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades, oh no
Don't masquerade with the guy in shades, oh no
I can't believe it
'Cause you got it made with the guy in shades, oh no

[Verse 2]
And I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
Forget my name while you collect your claim
And I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
See the light that's right before my eyes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
While she's deceiving me
She cuts my security
She got control of me
I turn to her and say

[Chorus]
Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades, oh no
Don't masquerade with the guy in shades, oh no
I can't believe it
'Cause you got it made with the guy in shades, oh no

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
She's deceiving me
Cuts my security
Has she got control of me?
I turn to her and say

[Chorus]
Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades, oh no
Don't masquerade with the guy in shades, oh no
I can't believe it
Don't be afraid of the guy in shades, oh no
It can't escape you
'Cause you got it made with the guy in shades, oh no
[Bridge]
I said
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I say to you now
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I cry to you
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night14Embed
