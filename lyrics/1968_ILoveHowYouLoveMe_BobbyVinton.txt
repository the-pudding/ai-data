Whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you
I love how you miss me
I love the way you always
Treat me tenderly
But darlin' most of all
I love how you love me

I love how your heart beats
Whenever I hold you
I love how you think of me
Without being told to
I love the way your touch
Is always heavenly
But darlin' most of all
I love how you love me

I love the way your touch
Is always heavenly
But darlin' most of all
I love how you love me

I love how you hug me
I love how you squeeze me
Tease me, please me
Love how you love me
