2 ContributorsCan’t You See That She’s Mine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Whoa, can't you see that she's mine?
We've been together for a long, long time
And yet they're tryin' so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on lovin' this way
But if they break us up, you know it'll only break my heart

[Verse 2]
Now, don't you know I love her so?
And I'll never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine?
We've been together for a long, long time
And it'll stay that way, because I know she loves me, too

[Bridge]
People talk, try to break us up
When we know they don't understand
I don't care what the people may say
I'm gonna keep on holdin' her hand

[Verse 1]
Can't you see that she's mine?
We've been together for a long, long time
And yet they're tryin' so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on lovin' this way
But if they break us up, you know it'll only break my heart

[Verse 2]
Don't you know I love her so?
And I'll never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine?
We've been together for a long, long time
And it'll stay that way, because I know she loves me, too
And it'll stay that way, because I know she loves me, tooEmbed
