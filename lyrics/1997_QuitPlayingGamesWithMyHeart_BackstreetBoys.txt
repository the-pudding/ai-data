Baby, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Brian]
Even in my heart, I see
You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (With my heart)
Before you tear us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop (From my heart)
You are tearing us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

[Verse 2: Nick]
I live my life the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Nick, Nick & Brian]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
You better â€¦

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (With my heart)
Before you tear us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop (From my heart)
You are tearing us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games

[Bridge: AJ, AJ & Kevin]
Baby, baby!
The love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hanging here forever
Oh baby, baby, this is not right
Let's stop this tonight

[Interlude: Brian & All]
Baby, oh-oh, quit playing games
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, baby
Na na na na na na
[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (With my heart)
Before you tear us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop (From my heart)
You are tearing us apart (My heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

[Outro: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na, baby
Na na na na na na
Quit playing games with my heart
Na na na na na na
With my heart
Na na na na na, baby
My heart, my heart2Embed
