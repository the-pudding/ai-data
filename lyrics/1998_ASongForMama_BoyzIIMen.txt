21 ContributorsA Song for Mama Lyrics[Verse 1]
You taught me everything
Everything you've given me
I'll always keep it inside
You're the driving force in my life, yeah
There isn't anything
Or anyone that I could be
And it just wouldn't feel right
If I didn't have you by my side
You were there for me to love and care for me
When skies were gray
Whenever I was down
You were always there to comfort me
And no one else can be
What you have been to me you will always be
You will always be the girl
In my life for all times

[Chorus]
Mama, Mama you know I love you
Mama, Mama you're the queen of my heart
Your love is like tears from the stars
Mama I just want you to know
Lovin' you is like food to my soul

[Verse 2]
You're always down for me
Have always been around for me even when I was bad
You showed me right from my wrong
Yes you did
And you took up for me
When everyone was downin' me
You always did understand
You gave me strength to go on
There were so many times
Looking back when I was so afraid
And then you'd come to me and say to me
I can face anything
And no one else can do
What you have done for me
You'll always be, you will always be
The girl in my life, ooh oh

Fills me up just thinkin' about you
I'll never go a day
Without my mama

[Chorus]

Mama, Mama you're the queen of my heart
Your love is like tears from the stars

Mama I just want you to know
Lovin' you is like food to my soul
