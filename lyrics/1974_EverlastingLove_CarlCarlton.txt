5 ContributorsEverlasting Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hearts go astray, leaving hurt when they go
I went away just when you needed me so
Filled with regret, I come back begging you
Forgive, forget, where's the love we once knew?

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
Girl, to be my bride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part
Of everlasting love

[Post-Chorus]
(Need a love to last forever) Oh
(Need a love to last forever) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Where life's river flows
No one really knows
Till someone's there to show
The way to lasting love
Like the sun it shines
Endlessly it shines
You always will be mine
It's eternal love
When other loves are gone
Ours will be strong
We have our very own
Everlasting love
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
(Need a love to last forever)
(Need a love to last forever) Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus 1]
Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
Girl, to be my bride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part
Of everlasting loveEmbed
