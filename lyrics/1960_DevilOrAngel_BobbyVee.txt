Which one you are I'd like to wake up and find
Devil or angel dear, whichever you are
I miss you, I miss you, I mi-i-iss you

Devil or angel please say you'll be mi-i-ine
Love me or leave me, I'll go out of my mind
Devil or angel dear, whichever you are
I need you, I need you, I need you

You look like an angel
Your smile is divine
But you keep me guessin'
Will you ever be mine?

Devil or angel please say you'll be mi-i-ine
Love me or leave, I've made up my mind
Devil or angel dear, whichever you are
I love you, I love you, I-I lo-o-ove you

Devil or angel please say you'll be mi-i-ine
Love me or leave, I've made up my mind
Devil or angel dear, whichever you are
I love you, I love you, I love youYou might also like2Embed
