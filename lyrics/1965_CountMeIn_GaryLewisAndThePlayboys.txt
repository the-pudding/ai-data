2 ContributorsCount Me In Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you need someone to count on, count me in
Someone you can rely on through thick and thin
When you start to count the ones that you might ever doubt
If you think of counting me, count me out

[Verse 2]
When you count the ones that want you, count me, too
And if I'm not first on your list, count me blue
Just be sure you count on me and when the counting's through
Count me madly in love with you

[Bridge]
Woo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Woo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo

[Verse 3]
If you need someone to count on when you're down
And all your other friends you've lost, count me found
Just be sure you count on me when you're down and out
Count me in through thick and thin or it don't count

[Verse 2]
When you count the ones that want you, count me, too
And if I'm not first on your list, count me blue
Just be sure you count on me and when the counting's through
Count me madly in love with you
