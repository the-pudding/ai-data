23 ContributorsHigher Lyrics[Verse 1]
When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there (Let's go there)
Let's go there (Let's go there)
Come on, let's go there (Go, go there)
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high, I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Set up high, I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?11Embed
