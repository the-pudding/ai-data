I'm ready for more
(Oo-oo-ooh)
The feelin' now that I'm beside you
We'll open the door
(Oo-oo-ooh)
Do anything that we decide to

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that there's something that's just out of sight
And I feel like I'm finally seeing the light
Holdin' on, girl I know it's right
I know it's right

[Chorus]
We're ready!
Hey! (Yeah!)

[Verse 2]
You and I
(Oo-oo-ooh)
We'll find a reason
To simplify (Simplify)
A change of season

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel that it's time we were off on our way
We can go so much farther than we've come today
Holdin' on girl and come what may
Come what may

We're ready now
(Oo-oo-ooh)
Catchin' a wave to ride on
Steady now
(Oo-oo-ooh)
Heading where we decide on

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that there's something that's just out of sight
And I feel like we're trying to do something right
Come on make it if we hold on tight (Ooh)
Hold on tight
