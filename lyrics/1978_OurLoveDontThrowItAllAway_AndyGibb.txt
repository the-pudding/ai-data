8 Contributors(Our Love) Donâ€™t Throw It All Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
Darling I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die

(You alone)
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
(Only my love)
Only my love can raise you high above it all

[Chorus]
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

[Verse 2]
We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
(Happy room)
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
(No other love)
No other woman's love could be as true, I'm begging you
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

[Bridge]
We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside

[Chorus]
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our loveEmbed
