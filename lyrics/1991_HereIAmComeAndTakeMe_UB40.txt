I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's you and me babe
That makes this world go round
Ah keeping you in love with me baby
Laying all my troubles down

[Chorus]
Here I am babe, come and take me
Here I am babe, come on and take me
Take me by the hand, ooh show me
Here I am babe, oooooaaah

[Verse 2]
It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart in two halves

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh I know it's you and me babe
That makes this world go round
Ah keeping you in love with me baby
Laying all my troubles down
