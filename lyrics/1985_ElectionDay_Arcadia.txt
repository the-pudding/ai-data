11 ContributorsElection Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wild kind of look to the day
Opening eyes impale neon flickers
She moon, she turning away
The city's her slave, he's cheating his mistress
She's moody and grey, she's mean and she's restless
So restless, so restless indeed

[Verse 2]
All over you as they say
Rumors or rivals yell at the strike force
Hi guys, by the way
Are you aware you're being illegal?
It's making your savior behavior look evil
'Scuse my timing, but say
How'd you fit in with this flim, flam and Judy?

[Pre-Chorus]
Maximum big surprise
Your smile is something new

[Chorus]
I pull my shirt off and pray
We're sacred and bound to suffer the heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray
We're coming up on re-election day
You might also like[Verse 3]
Stretching my love down the way
To your invitation, stretching my body
Use your intuitive play
'Cause maybe we have more playtime than money

[Pre-Chorus]
Maximum big surprise
She knows something new

[Chorus]
I pull my shirt off and pray
I'm saving myself to suffer the heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray
We're coming up on re-election day

[Bridge: Grace Jones]
By roads and backways, a lover's chance downwind
Cut open murmurs and sounds be calm hands on skin
Carry further, entangled strands all sing
I'm saving some time to slip away
We could dance!

[Post-Bridge]
Shouldn't be asking
Wild and scheming
Could be my election day
[Pre-Chorus]
Maximum big surprise
You know something new

[Chorus]
I pull my shirt off and pray
We're sacred and bound to suffer this heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray
We're coming up on re-election day
Re-election day
