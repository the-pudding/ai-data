And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you
And if I should ever go away
Well, then, close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

[Chorus: Dionne Warwick with Elton John]
Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder & Elton John]
Well, you came and opened me
And now, there's so much more I see
And so, by the way, I thank you
Oh, and then, for the times when we're apart
Well, then, close your eyes and know
These words are comin' from my heart
And then if you can remember, oh
