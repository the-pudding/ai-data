I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw that cat at my door
So I came in to you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

[Pre-Chorus]
Crystal ball on the table
Showin' the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast (Uh)

[Chorus]
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

[Verse 2]
"Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall, dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned"

[Chorus]
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

[Bridge]
From behind
From behind

[Break]
Stay away
Look out

[Verse 3]
If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways
[Pre-Chorus]
Crystal ball on the table
Showin' the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast (Uh)

[Chorus]
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you (Oh)
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind (Stay away)
Beware the devil woman (Oh)
She's gonna get you (She's gonna get you)
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
