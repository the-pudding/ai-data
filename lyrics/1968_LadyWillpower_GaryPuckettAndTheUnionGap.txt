Lady Willpower, it's now or never
Give your love to me and
I'll shower your heart with tenderness
Endlessly

[Verse 1]
I know you want to see me but you're afraid
Of what I might have on my mind
One thing you can be sure of
I'll take good care of your love
If you will let me give you mine

[Chorus]
Lady Willpower, it's now or never
Give your love to me and
I'll shower your heart with tenderness
Endlessly

[Verse 2]
Did no one ever tell you the facts of life?
Well, there's so much you have to learn
And I would gladly teach you
If I could only reach you
And get your loving in return
You might also like[Chorus]
Lady Willpower, it's now or never
Give your love to me and
I'll shower your heart with tenderness
Endlessly
Lady Willpower, it's now or never
Give your love to me and
I'll shower your heart with tenderness
EndlesslyEmbed
