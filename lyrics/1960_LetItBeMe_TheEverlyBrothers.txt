I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me

[Verse 2]
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

[Bridge]
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be?

[Verse 3]
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me

[Bridge]
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be?

So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me3Embed
