14 ContributorsGet It On Tonite Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, ooh wee oh, oh

[Verse 1]
When I'm lookin' at you, I keep thinkin'
Why can't she be like you? So I'm schemin'
I can't go on like this, believin'
That her love is true, oh
Standing on the dance floor while she trickin'
You are all I want girl, she's a chicken
We might be together but love is missin'
Girl, I want you
So what can we do? Oh

[Chorus]
Girl if it's alright (Oh)
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight (Let's get it on)
I've got a girl, but you look good tonight (You look so good, baby)
It's one on one tonight (You babe), tonight
Girl if it's alright (Alright)
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight (Yeah, get it on)
You shouldn't have to be alone tonight (Yeah, yeah)
It's one on one tonight, tonight (One on one, baby)

[Verse 2]
Now she's lookin' at me
But keep talkin'
Oh, now she tryna ice you
Let's start walkin'
Over on the dance floor
It's her fault but what can she do?
Tell me baby, yeah

Girl if you're ready (I'm ready)
We can get it on (We can get it on)
I know where I went wrong
(She's where you went wrong)
With you is where I belong, belong

[Bridge 2]
Girl if I could find the words to say
I gotta get away from a love
That kills me everyday
I'd gladly say to you

[Chorus]
Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl, but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight
Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
You shouldn't have to be alone tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

[Bridge 3]
My baby's stressin' me
You need to come with me
We need to go somewhere, yeah
Tonight, tonight
[Chorus]
Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl, but you look good tonight1Embed
