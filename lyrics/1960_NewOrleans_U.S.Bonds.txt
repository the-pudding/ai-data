3 ContributorsNew Orleans Lyrics[Chorus]
I said, a-hey-hey-hey-yeah

I said, a-hey, a-hey-hey-yeah
(I said, hey, hey-hey-yeah)

[Verse 1]
Well, come on ev'rybody take a trip with me
Well, down the Mississippi, down to New Orleans
They got the honeysuckle bloomin' on the honeysuckle vine
And a-love is a-bloomin' there all the time
You know ev'ry Southern Belle is a Mississippi Queen
Down the Mississippi, down in New Orleans

I said, a-hey-hey-hey-yeah
(I said, hey-hey-hey-yeah)
I said, a-hey-hey-hey-yeah
(Said,hey-hey-hey-yeah)

[Verse 2]
Well, come on take a stroll down to Basin Street
An' listen to the music with the Dixieland beat
A-where the magnolia blossoms fill the air
Yeah, an' if you ain't been to Heaven, then you ain't been there
They got the French moss hangin' from a big oak tree
Down the Mississippi, down in New Orleans
You might also like[Chorus]

I said a-look out, child, yeah-yeah-yeah
(I said, look out, child, yeah-yeah-yeah)

Well, come on ev'rybody take a trip with me
Well, down the Mississippi, down to New Orleans
Well, the honeysuckle's bloomin' on the honeysuckle vine
Yeah, an' love is a-bloomin' there all the time
You know ev'ry Southern Belle Is a Mississippi Queen
Down the Mississippi, down in New Orleans
