Ooh-ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears, I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead
You might also like[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 3]
People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me, dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Outro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey, honey, I know (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)
That you're letting me go (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I heard it through the grapevine (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)
Ooh, heard it through the grapevine (Yeah, yeah, yeah)8Embed
