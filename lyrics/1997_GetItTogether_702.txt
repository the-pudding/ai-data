I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go
But I really need to know
Can we get it together? (Oh, oh, oh)
Get it together? (Get it together, yeah)
I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
What I really hope and pray is (I don't wanna stay)
Can we get it together?
Get it together? (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Meelah, with 702]
You don't know the pain that I feel
You've taken my love for granted
And you just wanna see it your way, yeah
It's about that time
I'm gonna tell you what's on my mind
(What's on my mind, I'm fed up)
I'm fed up with you not being here with me
When you know love is all I need

[Chorus: 702, (Meelah)]
(I don't wanna stay)
I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go (I don't want to go)
But I really need to know
Can we get it together? (Can we get it?)
Get it together? (Yeah, and I don't wanna)
I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
What I really hope and pray is (Don't want to stay)
Can we get it together?
Get it together? (Let's get it together, babe)

I can't let go
'Cause being confused just takes control
I hope we can start brand new
'Cause I don't wanna lose you, oh no
With a love we shared, baby, it's oh so rare
I'm willing to try and make you see
That all you need is here in me

[Bridge: Meelah, with 702]
I don't wanna stay (I don't wanna stay)
I don't wanna go, don't wanna go (I don't wanna go)
But you gotta let me know
How you feel (Let me know how you feel, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna stay (Don't wanna go)
I don't wanna go, don't wanna go (Oh, no)
But you gotta let me know (You've gotta let me know)
How you feel (Just how you feel, yeah)

You know I don't wanna go
Baby, please listen to me

Can we get it together? (Can we, hey?)
Get it together? (I hope, I pray, baby, baby)
I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay (I need to know)
What I really hope and pray is (I got to know)
Can we get it together?
Get it together?
