Spare a little candle, save some light for me
Figures up ahead moving in the trees
White skin in linen, perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over these dreams in the mist

[Verse 2]
Darkness on the edge, shadows where I stand (Shadows where I stand)
I search for the time on a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly, come closer than this (All that I remember)
But all I remember are the dreams in the mist

[Chorus]
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away (The further I'm away)

[Verse 3]
Is it cloak-and-dagger? Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut through a stained-glass wall (Weaker in my eyesight)
Weaker in my eyesight, the candle in my grip (Words that have no form)
And words that have no form are falling from my lips

[Chorus]
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away (The further I'm away)

There's something out there I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there I can't resist

[Verse 4]
The sweetest song is silence that I've ever heard (Feet don't touch the earth)
Funny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes, freedom is a kiss (The prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face from dreams in the mist

[Chorus]
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away
These dreams go on when I close my eyes (Every single se—)
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away…3Embed
