3 ContributorsSan Franciscan Nights LyricsThis following program is dedicated to the city and people of
San Francisco, who may not know it but they are beautiful and
So is their city this is a very personal song, so if the viewer
Cannot understand it particularly those of you who are
European residents, save up all your bread and fly trans love
Airways to San Francisco U.S.A., then maybe you'll understand
The song, it will be worth it, if not for the sake of this song, but
For the sake of your own peace of mind

Strobe lights beam, creates dreams
Walls move, minds to do
On a warm San Francisco night
Old child young child feel alright
On a warm San Francisco night
Angels sing, leather wings
Jeans of blue, Harley Davisons too
On a warm San Francisco night
Old angels young angels feel alright
On a warm San Francisco night
I wasn't born there, perhaps I'll die there
There's no place left to go, San Francisco
Cop's face is filled with hate
Heavens above he's on a street called love
When will they ever learn
Old cop young cop feel alright
On a warm San Francisco night
The children are cool
They don't raise fools
It's an american dream
