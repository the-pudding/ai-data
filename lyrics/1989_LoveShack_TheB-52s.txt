If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says
“15 miles to the
Love Shack”
Love Shack, yeah, yeah
I'm heading down the Atlanta highway
Looking for the love getaway
Headed for the love getaway
I got me a car that's as big as a whale
And we're heading on down to the Love Shack
I got me a Chrysler that seats about 20
So hurry up and bring your jukebox money

The Love Shack is a little old place where we can get together
Love Shack, baby (a-Love Shack, baby)
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack (Love, baby, that's where it's at)
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack (Love, baby, that's where it's at)

Sign says (woo!), “Stay away, fools
'Cause love rules at the Love Shack”
Well, it's set way back in the middle of a field
Just a funky old shack and I gotta get back
Glitter on the mattress
Glitter on the highway
Glitter on the front porch
Glitter on the highway
You might also likeThe Love Shack is a little old place where we can get together
Love Shack, baby (Love Shack, baby)
Love Shack, that's where it's at
Love Shack, that's where it's at

Hugging and a-kissing
Dancing and a-loving
Wearing next to nothing
'Cause it's hot as an oven
The whole shack shimmies
Yeah, the whole shack shimmies
The whole shack shimmies
When everybody's moving around
And around and around and around
Everybody's moving, everybody's grooving, baby
Folks lining up outside just to get down
Everybody's moving, everybody's grooving, baby
Funky little shack
Funky little shack

[Instrumental Break]

Hop in my Chrysler, it's as big as a whale, and it's about to set sail
I got me a car, it seats about 20
So come on and bring your jukebox money
The Love Shack is a little old place where we can get together
Love Shack, baby (a-Love Shack, baby)
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack (Love, baby, that's where it's at)
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack (Love, baby, that's where it's at)

Bang, bang, bang on the door baby
Knock a little louder baby
Bang, bang, bang on the door baby
I can't hear you
Bang, bang, bang on the door, baby
Knock a little louder, sugar
Bang, bang, bang on the door, baby
I can't hear you
Bang, bang, bang on the door, baby (Knock a little louder)
Bang, bang, bang on the door baby
Bang, bang (On the door, baby)
Bang, bang (On the door)
Bang, bang (On the door, baby)
Bang, bang
Your what?
Tin roof, rusted
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack (Love, baby, that's where it's at, yeah)
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack (Love, baby, that's where it's at)
Love Shack, baby, Love Shack
Hugging and a-kissing
Dancing and a-loving
At the Love Shack2Embed
