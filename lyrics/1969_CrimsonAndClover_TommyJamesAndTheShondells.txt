Ah, now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover
Ah, I wish she'd come walking over
Now I've been waiting to show her
Crimson and clover
Over and over

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Yeah (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
My my, such a sweet thing (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
I wanna do everything (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
What a beautiful feeling (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Crimson and clover (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Over and over

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and overSee Tommy James and the Shondells LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also like6Embed
