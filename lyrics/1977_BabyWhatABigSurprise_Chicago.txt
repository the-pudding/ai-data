7 ContributorsBaby, What a Big Surprise Lyrics[Verse 1: Peter Cetera]
Right before my very eyes
I thought that you were only faking it
And like before, my heart was taking it

[Chorus: All, Peter Cetera]
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Oh whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 2: Peter Cetera]
Yesterday, it seemed to me
My life was nothing more than wasted time
But here today you've softly changed my mind

[Chorus: All, Peter Cetera]
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa

[Bridge: All]
Just to be alone
Was a little more than I could take
Then you came to stay
Ooh ooh
Hold me in the morning
Love me in the afternoon
Help me find my way
Yeah yeah

Now and then just like before
I think about the love I've thrown away
But now it doesn't matter anyway

[Outro: All, Peter Cetera]
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes (Ooh whoa oh)
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Ho ho-oh
Oh whoa oh whoa
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyesEmbed
