15 ContributorsYouâ€™re All I Need To Get By Lyrics[Intro]
You're all I need to get by
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
(You're all I need) Like the sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
(To get by) And it was plain to see, you were my destiny
(You're all I need) With arms open wide
I threw away my pride
(To get by) I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I will go (Oh) where you lead (Come on now)
Always there in time of need (Oh, oh)
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

[Chorus]
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, you're all I need to get by
(You're all I need to get by) Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tammi, listen
You might also like[Verse 2]
(You're all I need) Like an eagle protects his nest
I'll do my very best
(To get by) Stand by you like a tree
And dare anybody to try and move me
(You're all I need) Darling, in you I found
Strength when I was torn down
(To get by) Don't know what's in store
But together we can open any door

[Pre-Chorus]
Just to do what's good for you
And inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man
Out of a soul that didn't have a goal

[Verse 3]
'Cause we, we got the right foundation
And with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all, all the joys under the sun wrapped up in one

[Chorus]
You're all, you're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need (Oh) to get by
(You're all I need to get by) Oh babe
(Oh, oh) Oh babe
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, yeah
(You're all I need to get by) I need you darling
(Oh, oh) Oh, I need you, (You're all)
All your love (All I need, oh)
(You're all I need to get by) I love you, darling
Oh, baby
All I need (You're all I need)
I need your love (You're all I want)
Oh
(You're all I need to get by) Oh
All your love now (Yeah)
Hey Tammi (Oh yeah) you're all I need5Embed
