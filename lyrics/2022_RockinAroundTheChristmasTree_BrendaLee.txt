35 ContributorsRockinâ€™ Around the Christmas Tree Lyrics[Verse]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

[Saxophone Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"
You might also like[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way9Embed
