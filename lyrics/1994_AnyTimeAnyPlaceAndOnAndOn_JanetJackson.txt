3 ContributorsAny Time, Any Place (Live on SNL) Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the thundering rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thighs
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna stop just because
People walking by are watching us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop no, no, no
I want you
All I wanna say is

[Chorus]
Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around, no, no, no, no, no
Mmm  ooo oo oo
See Janet Jackson LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like[Verse 2]
Dancing on the floor
Feeling the slow groove
My mind is starting to burn
With forbidden thoughts
Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinking maybe we could
Well... you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop baby)
People standing around are watching us (Standing around are watching us)
I don't give a damn what they think (I don't give a damn)
I want you now (I want you now)
I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop)
You feel so good inside of my love (Inside of my love)
I'm not gonna stop no, no, no (No, no, no)
I want you ((I want you now))

[Chorus]
Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around
I'll say it again
Say it again
Any time, baby
And any place
I don't care who's around
Baby, baby
I don't care who's around
Baby, baby
I don't care who's around
Any time
Any place  no, no, no, no, no, noEmbed
