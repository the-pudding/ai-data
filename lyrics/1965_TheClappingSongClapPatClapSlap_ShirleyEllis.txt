Clap-pat, clap-pat
Clap-pat, clap-slap

(Clap-pat) Clap your hand, pat it on your partner's hand, right hand
(Clap-pat) Clap your hand, cross it with your left arm, pat your partner's left palm
(Clap-pat) Clap your hand, pat your partner's right palm with your right palm again
(Clap-pat) Clap your hands, slap your thighs, and sing a little song, go

My mother told me
If I was good-ee

A rubber dolly
My aunty told her

Now she won't buy me
A rubber dollyYou might also likeEmbed
