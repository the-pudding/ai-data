22 ContributorsDancing On the Ceiling Lyrics(Cheering)
Whoo!

What is happening here
Something going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the light
We're gonna have a party, it's starting tonight

Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling

The room is hot and that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people starting to climb the walls
Oooh, it looks like everybody is having a ball

Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling, ah
Oh, oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Come on!
Whoo!
Alright

Everybody starts to lose control when the music is right
If you see somebody hanging around, don't get uptight
The only thing we wanna do tonight
Is go round and round and turn upside down
Come on, let's get down!

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.......(Cheering)

So come on and get loose
Don't hold back 'cause it ain't no use
Hard to keep your feet on the ground
'Cause when we like to party, we only wanna get down

Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling, ah
Oh, what a feeling, baby, when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling, whoa

Say what?
Can't stop now, just getting started
Everybody clap your hands.  (Clapping)
Come on!
Everybody let's dance!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling, baby
Baby, we're gonna dance all night till the broad daylight
Keep on moving, keep on grooving
Oh yeah
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceilingEmbed
