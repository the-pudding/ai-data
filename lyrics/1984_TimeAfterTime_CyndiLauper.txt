Lyin' in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, (I'll be waiting) I will be waiting
Time after time

[Verse 3]
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watchin' through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
See Cyndi Lauper LiveGet tickets as low as $100You might also like[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You say, "Go slow," I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, (I'll be waiting) I will be waiting
Time after time

[Outro]
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after
