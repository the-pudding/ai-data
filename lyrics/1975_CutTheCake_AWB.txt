1 ContributorB(reak) LyricsI don’t want nobody but you
You make me feel like I ain’t really got a clue
Every time I’m with you Deja Vu
Baby you so hot I gotta keep cool

I got class fuck school
Bitch I’m bombing in the deep end in the Stu
Going haywire for the 8th hour
I Put in work while they wait on fate sour

Ya

Tax paid
And I Still got much more paper in the safe
I’m really going all the fucking way
Cmon and show me how you dipping when you shake

Steady sliming on the d she ride the wave
And she bang the way I make the 808s
If you slacking don’t come at me for the shade
I leave you broke down beat where you stay

I leave you soaked now I leave you for the day
I won’t return until it’s time to cut the cake
How’s about I snap my thumb
Middle finger always up
Riddle me this
Who is really finna be missed
You might also likeMuze to the Sickity Sikk
On a rickety ship
Flow is differently mixed

Flick the pimp in the wrist
Isn’t this glimpse in a sense
A distant imminent stint
Pollute my mind with your lies
I take to the skies

I don’t want nobody but you
You make me feel like I ain’t really got a clue
Every time I’m with you Deja Vu
Baby you so hot I gotta keep cool

I got class fuck school
Bitch I’m bombing in the deep end in the Stu
Going haywire for the 8th hour
I Put in work while they wait on fate sour

Ya

Tax paid
And I Still got much more paper in the safe
I’m really going all the fucking way
Cmon and show me how you dipping when you shake
Steady sliming on the d she ride the wave
And she bang the way I make the 808s
If you slacking don’t come at me for the shade
I leave you broke down beat where you stayEmbed
