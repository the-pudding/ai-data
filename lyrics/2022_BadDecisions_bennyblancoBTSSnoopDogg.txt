No makeup on, I love that sh—
You're so damn beautiful, I swear you make me sick
I want your love, I want your name
Inside my heart, there's nothin' but a burning flame

[Pre-Chorus: V]
If you want my love
Come a little bit closer
Don't make me wait

[Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin, Jin & V]
Let's make some bad decisions
I want you, ooh, baby, all of the time
So give me all your kisses
I want you Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, baby, every night
And it feels like (Ooh, ah)
I can't seem to ever get you out of my mind
And it feels like (Ooh, ah)
I want you, ooh, baby, all of the time

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Jung Kook]
Everybody see me lookin' fly (Oh, yeah)
And I think I know the reason why (Oh, yeah)
'Cause I got you right here by my side (Oh, yeah)
And I can't let you just walk away
If I ain't with ya, I'm not okay

Come a little bit closer
Don't make me wait (Ooh)

[Chorus: Jimin, V, Snoop Dogg, Jung Kook & *Jin*]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Let's do things you always wanted
Have some fun and live your life
Help me waste a day and find a place
That we can face-to-face
Let me show you 'round my hood
It's bad meaning bad like bad meaning good
When it comes to rules, I break 'em

Let's make some bad decisions
I want you, ooh, baby, all of the time
So give me (Give me), all your kisses (Kisses)

And it feels like (Ooh, yes, ah, yes)
I can't seem to ever get you out of my mind
And it feels like (Ooh, say what? Ah)
I want you, ooh, baby, all of the time (Ooh)12Embed
