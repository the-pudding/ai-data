33 ContributorsWoman Lyrics[Intro]
(For the other half of the sky)

[Verse 1]
Woman
I can hardly express
My mixed emotions at my thoughtlessness
After all, I'm forever in your debt
And woman
I will try to express
My inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success

[Chorus]
Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

[Verse 2]
Woman, I know you understand
The little child inside the man
Please remember my life is in your hands
And woman
Hold me close to your heart
However distant, don't keep us apart
After all, it is written in the stars
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, well

[Verse 3]
Woman
Please let me explain
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain
So let me tell you again and again and again

[Outro]
I love you, yeah, yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah2Embed
