5 ContributorsThe First Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know I won't forget the times
We shared together holding hands
And walking in the park
Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then
I have no regrets

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you tell from the look on my face
That I love you more today

[Chorus]
The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

[Verse 2]
Although some time has passed
I still remember just like it was yesterday
The time is moving fast
The love I have for you time won't ever change
I'll always feel the same now until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories we share will live forever
Deep inside my heart I know I'll never forget
You might also like[Chorus]
The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

[Outro]
Oh, when we fell in loveEmbed
