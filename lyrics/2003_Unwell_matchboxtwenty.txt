39 ContributorsUnwell Lyrics[Verse 1]
All day
Starin' at the ceilin', makin'
Friends with shadows on my wall
All night
Hearin' voices tellin' me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on
Feelin' like I'm headed for a
Breakdown
And I don't know why

[Chorus]
But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

[Verse 2]
Me
I'm talkin' to myself in public
And dodgin' glances on the train
And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong

With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

[Chorus]
But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

[Bridge]
I've been talkin' in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah, they're takin' me away

[Chorus]
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be
[Outro]
Hey, how I used to be
How I used to be
Well, I'm just a little unwell
How I used to be
How I used to be
I'm just a little unwell22Embed
