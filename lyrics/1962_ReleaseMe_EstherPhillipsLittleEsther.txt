5 ContributorsRelease Me Lyrics[Chorus]
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Oh, please release me, let me go
I, I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin
Release me and let me love again

[Verse]
I, I have found upon new love dear
And don't you know
I'll always, I'll always want him near
His lips are warm while yours are cold
Release me, my darling
Why don't you just let me go

[Instrumental Break 01:50-02:20]

[Chorus]
Oh, please release me, let me go
I said, I don't love you
I just don't, I just don't love you anymore
To live together, to live together
Lord knows, is a sin
Release me and let me love again

[Outro]
Let me go, let me goYou might also likeEmbed
