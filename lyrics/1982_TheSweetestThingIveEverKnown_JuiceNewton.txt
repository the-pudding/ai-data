When I see you in the morning
That old sleep still in your eyes
I remember all the laughter
And the tears we shared last night

[PreChorus 1]
And as we lie here, just two shadows
In the light before the dawn
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

[Chorus]
And I have never been afraid of losing
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

[Verse 2]
Now, you and I, we're not children
We have both been loved before
We have given and we have taken
Many rides on troubled shores
You might also like[PreChorus 2]
And all the heartaches and temptations
Only make me love you more
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving youEmbed
