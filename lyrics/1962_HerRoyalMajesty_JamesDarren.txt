Ladies and gentlemen
Presenting, Her Royal Majesty

[Verse]
There she goes
Her Royal Majesty
She's the queen that broke my heart
I put her up, upon a throne
And now she's left me all alone and cryin'
There she goes
Her Royal Majesty
Wearin' my heart for a crown
Oh, let me tell you, everybody how she made a fool of me
Her Royal Majesty

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, now, would ya believe she acted oh-so sweet
Until she just had me kneelin' at her feet?
She got me to eat right from her little hand
Her smallest wish was my command

[Chorus]
Well, there she goes
Her Royal Majesty
Marching off with someone new
Well, I believed she really loved me, but now at last I see
I was the King of Fools to Her Royal Majesty
You might also like[Outro]
Well, I believed she really loved me, but now at last I see
I was the King of Fools to Her Royal
Her Royal MajestyEmbed
