Ha, it's poetry in motion
She turned her tender eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony
Mm, but she blinded me with science
She blinded me with science
Failed me in biology, hey, huh, huh

When I'm dancing close to her
Blinding me with science, science
Science
I can smell the chemicals
Blinding me with science, science
Science
Science

[Chorus]
Mm now, but it's poetry in motion
When she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
Sweet as any harmony
She blinded me with science
She blinded me with science
Failed me in geometry (Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)

The elements in harmony
She blinded me with science
She blinded me with science

[Bridge]
I, I don't believe it, there she goes again
She's tidied up and I can't find anything
All my tubes and wires and careful notes
And antiquated notions
[Chorus]
But it's poetry in motion
When she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony
Oh, she blinded me with science
She blinded me with science
