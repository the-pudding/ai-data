Got on board a westbound 747
Didn't think before deciding what to do
Ooh, that talk of opportunities
TV breaks and movies
Rang true, sure rang true

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before

[Chorus]
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours

[Verse 2]
Out of work, I'm out of my head
I'm out of self respect, I'm out of bread
I'm under-loved, I'm underfed
I wanna go home

[Chorus]
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours

Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it?
Had offers but don't know which one to take
Please don't tell 'em how you found me
Don't tell 'em how you found me
Gimme a break, give me a break

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before

[Chorus]
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours4Embed
