(Hey!)
Well, my temperature's rising and my feet left the floor
Crazy people knocking 'cause they're wanting some more
Let me in, baby, I don't know what you got
But you better take it easy, this place is hot

[Chorus]
And I'm so glad we made it
So glad we made it
I want, gimme some-a lovin'
Gimme some-a lovin'
Gimme some-a lovin', every day

[Verse 2]
(Hey!)
Well, my head's a-spinning and I'm floating to sound
Too much is happening 'cause you're not around
It's been a hard day and nothing went too good
I'm gonna relax like-a everybody should

[Chorus]
And I'm so glad we made it
So glad we made it
I want you, gimme some-a lovin'
Gimme some-a lovin'
Gimme some-a lovin', every day

(Hey!)
Well, I feel so good, everything is getting higher
You better take some time off 'cause the place is on fire
Better stop, baby, 'cause I have so much to do
We made it, baby, and it happened to you

[Outro]
And I'm so glad we made it
So glad we made it
(Gimme some a-lovin') Every day
(Gimme some a-lovin') Every night
(Gimme some a-lovin') Ooh, hoo!
(Gimme some-a lovin') Gimme some a-lovin' every day
(Gimme some a-lovin') Hey-hey, baby
(Gimme some a-lovin') Ooh, hoo
(Gimme some a-lovin') Oh, every day
(Gimme some a-lovin') Give your lovin', baby3Embed
