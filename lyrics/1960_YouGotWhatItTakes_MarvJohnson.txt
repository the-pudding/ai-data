4 ContributorsYou Got What It Takes Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't drive a big, fine car
You don't look like a movie star
And on your money we won't get far

[Chorus]
But baby, you got what it takes (Yeah, yeah) to satisfy (yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
You got what it takes for me

[Verse 2]
Now, you don't live in a beautiful place
You don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face

[Chorus]
But baby, you got what it takes (Yeah, yeah) to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
You got what it takes for me

[Bridge]
Now, when you're near me, ooh-wee
My head goes around and around
And when you kiss me, oh yeah
My love comes tumblin' down
You send me
You might also like[Verse 2]
You don't live in a beautiful place
You don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face

[Chorus]
But baby, you got what it takes (Yeah, yeah) to satisfy (yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
Woah, oh, oh and a-woah, oh, oh
You got what it takes for me

[Bridge]
Now, when you're near me, little girl
My head goes around and around
And when you kiss me, oh yeah
My love comes tumblin' down
You send me

[Verse 2]
You don't live in a beautiful place
You don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face

[Chorus]
But baby, you got what it takes (Yeah, yeah) to satisfy (yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
You got what it takes for me
[Outro]
Oh yeah
You got what it takes
Don't need no money
Baby, you don't need no car
Come on
You know you got-a what it takes for meEmbed
