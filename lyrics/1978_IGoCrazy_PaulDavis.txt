8 ContributorsI Go Crazy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello, girl, it's been a while
Guess you'll be glad to know
That I've learned how to laugh and smile
Getting over you was slow
They say old lovers can be good friends
But I never thought I'd really see you
I'd really see you again

[Chorus]
I go crazy
When I look in your eyes, I still go crazy
No, my heart just can't hide
That old feelin' inside
Way deep down inside
Oh, baby
You know when I look in your eyes I go crazy

[Verse 2]
You say he satisfies your mind
Tells you all of his dreams
I know how much that means to you
I realize that I was blind
Just when I thought I was over you
I see your face and it just ain't true
No, it just ain't true
You might also like[Chorus]
I go crazy
When I look in your eyes, I still go crazy
That old flame comes alive
It starts burning inside
Way deep down inside
Oh, baby
You know when I look in your eyes I go crazy

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
I go crazy
You know when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
No, my heart just can't hide
That old feelin' inside
Way deep down inside
I go crazy2Embed
