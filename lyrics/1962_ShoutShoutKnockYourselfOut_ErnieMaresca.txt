Wop wop wop, wop wop adada dada
Wop wop wop, wop wop adada dada

Shout Shout knock yourself out..
Comeon yell yell loud and swell
You gotta Scream scream you know what I mean
Put another dime in the record machine..
Hey we're having a party now it's just begun
We're all over here and we're having fun..
Joe's all alone and he wants to be kissed
While Mary's in the corner and she's doing the twist..
So Let's Shout Shout knock yourself out..
Comeon yell yell loud and swell
You gotta Scream scream you know what I mean
Put another dime in the record machine..
Hey Play another song like A Runaround Sue
Let's do a dance that we all can do..
Turn that jukebox up mighty loud
Let's liven up this crazy crowd..
Comeon Shout Shout knock yourself out..
Comeon yell yell loud and swell
You gotta Scream scream you know what I mean
Put another dime in the record machine..
Every party that I intend
Believe now it's the livin end
Moving and groovin with some friends of mine..
Saturday night now we're having a time ...
So Lets..Shout Shout knock yourself out..
Comeon yell yell loud and swell
You gotta Scream scream you know what I mean
Put another dime in the record machine..
Hey Doing the fly with our hands in the sky..
Yeah, foot stomping baby just a you and I
School was out about a quarter to three
And we're having fun it's plain to see..
So Lets..Shout Shout knock yourself out..
Comeon yell yell loud and swell
You gotta Scream scream you know what I mean
Put another dime in the record machine..You might also likeEmbed
