5 Contributors98.6 Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Good morning, sun, I say it's good to see you shining
I know my baby brought you to me
She kissed me yesterday, hello to silver lining
Got spring and summer running through me

[Chorus]
Hey, 98.6, it's good to have you back again
Oh, hey, 98.6, her lovin' is the medicine
That saved me, oh, I love my baby

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Hey, everybody on the street, I see you smiling
Must be because I found my baby
You know she's got me on another kind of highway
I want to go to where it takes me

[Chorus]
Hey, 98.6, it's good to have you back again
Oh, hey, 98.6, her lovin' is the medicine
That saved me, oh, I love my baby

Oh, hey, 98.6, her lovin' is the medicine
That saved me, oh, I love my baby
