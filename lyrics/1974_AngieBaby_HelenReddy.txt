13 ContributorsAngie Baby Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock 'n' roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you outta school
You're a little touched, you know, Angie, baby

[Verse 2]
Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you 'cross the floor (Angie)
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
"Angie girl, are you all right?
Tell the radio goodnight"
All alone once more, Angie, baby

[Chorus]
Angie, baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

[Verse 3]
Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peekin' in Angie's room
At night through her window blind
"I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie, baby"
(Angie, baby, Angie, baby)

When he walks in her room
He feels confused like he walked into a play
And the music's so loud, it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound, never to be found

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side, Angie, baby

[Chorus]
Angie, baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe
[Outro]
Well, maybe (Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
Well, maybe (Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
(Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
(Angie, baby, Angie, baby)...3Embed
