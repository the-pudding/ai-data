21 ContributorsLonely Boy Lyrics[Verse 1]
He was born on a summer day, 1951
And with a slap of a hand, he had landed as an only son

[Pre-Chorus 1]
His mother and father said: "What a lovely boy?
We'll teach him what we learned, ah, yes! Just what we learned
We'll dress him up warmly and we'll send him to school
It'll teach him how to fight, to be nobody's fool"

[Chorus]
Oh!
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?

[Verse 2]
In the summer of '53, his mother brought him a sister
And she told him: "We must attend to her needs, she's so much younger than you"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, he ran down the hall and he cried
Oh! How could his parents have lied?
When they said he was their only son
He thought he was their only one
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh!
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?

[Bridge]
Goodbye Mama!
Goodbye you!
Goodbye Papa!
I'm pushing on through!

[Verse 3]
He left home on a winter day, 1969
And he hoped to find all the love he had lost in that earlier time

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Well, his sister grew up
And she married a man
He gave her a son
Ah, yes! A lovely son
They dressed him up warmly
They sent him to school
It taught him how to fight
To be nobody's fool
[Chorus]
Oh!
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?

[Outro]
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?1Embed
