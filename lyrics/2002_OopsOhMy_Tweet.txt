15 ContributorsOops (Oh My) Lyrics[Verse 1: Tweet]
Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance
From his body, so buttery brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook, I had to catch my breath

[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

[Verse 2: Tweet]
I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride
Let it ride and partied
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left; a reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my (Oh my)
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

[Bridge: Missy Elliott & (Tweet)]
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was looking so good, I couldn't reject myself
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was feeling so good, I had to touch myself
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was eyeing my thighs, butter pecan brown
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, comin' outta my shirt and then my skirt came down

[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my (Oh my)
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my (Oh my)
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?2Embed
