I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart has gone to sleep
One of these mornin's I'll be gone
My heart belongs to me

[Verse 2]
Can we believe in fairytales?
Can love survive when all else fails?
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me

[Chorus]
But now my love, hey didn't I love you
But we knew what had to be
Somehow my love, I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me

[Verse 3]
Put out the light and close your eyes
Come lie beside me
Don't ask why
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me

[Chorus]
But now my love, hey didn't I love you
Didn't I love you
Didn't I love you
Didn't I love you, baby
Don't cry my love
I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me
You might also like[Outro]
I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me

(Didn't I love you, didn't I love you)Embed
