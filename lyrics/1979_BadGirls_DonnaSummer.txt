Toot toot, hey, beep beep, toot toot, hey, beep beep
Toot toot, hey, beep beep, toot toot, hey, beep beep

[Chorus 1]
Bad girls, talking ’bout the sad girls
Sad girls, talking ’bout bad, bad girls, yeah

[Verse 1]
See them out on the street at night (Walkin')
Picking up all kinds of strangers, if the price is right
You can score if your pocket’s tight
But you want a good time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You ask yourself, "Who they are?"
Like everybody else, they come from near and far
Woah, bad girls, yeah

[Chorus 1]
Bad girls (Bad girls), talking ’bout the sad girls, yeah (Sad girls)
The sad girls (Sad girls), talking ’bout bad, bad girls, yeah

[Verse 2]
Friday night and the strip is hot (Hot)
Sun’s gone down and they’re out to trot (Out trottin')
Spirit’s high and legs look hot
Do you wanna get down?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now, don’t you ask yourself, "Who they are?"
Like everybody else, they wanna be a star
Woah, yeah, yeah, they're just bad girls

[Chorus 2]
Bad girl, sad girl, you’re such a dirty bad girl
Beep beep, uh-huh
You bad girl, you sad girl, you’re such a dirty bad girl
Beep beep, uh-huh

[Verse 3]
Now you and me, we are both the same (Both the same)
Though you call yourself by a different name (Different names)
Now your Mama won’t like it when she finds out (Finds out)
Girl is out at night
