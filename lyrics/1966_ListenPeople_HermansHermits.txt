Listen people
To what I say
I say everybody's
Got to have their day

[Chorus]
And don't you know that
Everybody's got to love somebody sometime
Everybody's got to win a heart
Everybody's got to love somebody sometime
When you do, I hope you never part

[Verse 2]
I once found love
Found love just like you
But then he came
He might come to you

[Chorus]
And don't you know that
Everybody's got to lose somebody sometime
But everybody can part
Everybody's got to lose somebody sometime
So, take care that you don't lose your heart

You'll be happy as you can be
