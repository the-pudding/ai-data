Back to you-ou on bended knee
Snap your fingers (doo-doo), I'll come runnin' (doo-doo)
I'll be true (doo-doo-doo), take a chance on me (doo-doo-doo)

Let your light turn green, baby, I've gotta know
Give me some kind of clue, should I stay or go?
Let me love you like a lover, un-huh, that you used to know
Turn the key and let me in through that same old door

(Wah-wah-wah-wah)
I had it but I lost it
Now I've got a broken heart to mend
I don't care what the cost is
I know I got to find my way back in

Snap your fingers, baby, I'll come runnin'
I'll do anything to get back again

(Wah-wah-wah-wah)
I had it but I lost it
Now I've got a broken heart to mend
I don't care what the cost is
I've got to find my way back in

Snap your fingers (doo-doo-doo) I'll come runnin' (doo-doo-doo)
I'll do anything (doo-doo-doo) to get back againYou might also likeEmbed
