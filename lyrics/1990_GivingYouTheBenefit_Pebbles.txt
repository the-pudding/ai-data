6 ContributorsGiving You the Benefit LyricsLately I've been trying to figure out your mind
And why you keep dissing me
Poor little me
And why you had the change of heart to turn it all around
And then try to put it on me
Poor little me

But don't you know I can be a trip
I can make things hard
But baby, I believe that you still got a heart
That's why I try to stop myself before I start
'Cause I can make it rough, I can make it tough, but I won't

Well, I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
Baby, work it on, work it on out.  (Work, work, work.)
Baby, work it on, work in on out.  (Work, work.)
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

Baby, how could you be hanging out on a diamond queen
Ain't you missing me, poor little me
When you knew all the time that you could've been with your home girl loving and a-kissing on me
Sweet little me

You gotta work real hard
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one
Then nothing in the world should make us part
'Cause we can make it work if you take away the hurt from my heart

I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
Baby, work it on, work it on out.  (Work, work, work.)
Work it, baby
(Work, work.) Keep trying to work it on, work it on, work it on, work it on out
(Work, work, work.) Work it, baby
(Work, work.) Keep trying to work it on out.  Mmmm

(Oh.) I can be a trip, but I choose not to
(Oh, oh.) Deep inside of you, I think there's still good in you, boy
(Oh.) Don't give me no reason not to trust you
(Oh, oh.) Just take the benefit
Don't give me no lip and I'll be sweet to you
