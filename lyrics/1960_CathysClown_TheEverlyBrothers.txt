Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

[Bridge]
I've gotta stand tall, you know a man can't crawl
For when he knows you're telling lies
And he hears 'em passing by, he's not a man at all

[Chorus]
Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

[Bridge]
When you see me shed a tear and you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad that you're treating me so bad?
Or don't you even care?

[Chorus]
Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clownYou might also like2Embed
