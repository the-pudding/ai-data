It's a little bit funny
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
You might also like[Verse 4]
So excuse me forgettin'
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is the song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world55Embed
