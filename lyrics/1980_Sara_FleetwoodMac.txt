38 ContributorsSara Lyrics[Intro]
Wait a minute baby...
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me 'bout the fire

[Verse 1]
Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home

[Bridge]
And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing, and undoing
Ooh the laces
Undoing the laces

[Verse 2]
Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Oh then call me home
You might also like[Bridge]
Hold on, the night is coming
And the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there, yeah
Ask me and I'm there 'cause I care

[Verse 3]
In the sea of love
Where every woman would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
Oh, if you build your house
Then please call me home

[Verse 4]
Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don't you ever stop
And now it's gone
No, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

[Outro]
Sara
Sara
Thereâ€™s a heartbeat that never really died
Heartbeat that never really died (Sara)
Oh, won't you swallow your pride?
All I ever wanted was to know that you were dreaming14Embed
