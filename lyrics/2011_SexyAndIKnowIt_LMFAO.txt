Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
When I walk on by, girls be looking like, "Damn, he fly"
I pimp to the beat, walking down the street in my new LaFreak
Yeah, this is how I roll, animal print, pants outta control
It's Redfoo with the big afro
And like Bruce Leroy, I got the glow, yeah

[Chorus]
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) I-I-I work out
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) I-I-I work out
When I walk in the spot (Yeah)
This is what I see (Okay)
Everybody stops and is staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it

[Drop]
I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it

Yeah
When I'm at the mall, security just can't fight 'em all
And when I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks (What)
This is how I roll, come on, ladies, it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby, don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt, and I still get service, watch

[Chorus]
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) I-I-I work out
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
I-I-I work out
When I walk in the spot (Yeah)
This is what I see (Okay)
Everybody stops and is staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it

[Drop]
I'm sexy and I know it (Ay)
I'm sexy and I know it
Check it out, check it out
[Bridge]
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wig-, yeah, yeah
Do the wiggle, man
I do the wiggle, man
Yeah, I'm sexy and I know it
Ay, yeah

[Chorus]
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
(Ah) I-I-I work out
(Ah) Girl, look at that body
