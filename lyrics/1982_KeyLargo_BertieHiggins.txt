Wrapped around each other, trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together, lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies, falling in love so desperately
Honey I was your hero, and you were my leading lady

[Chorus]
We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our own late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you, kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo
Ooo-ooo

[Verse 2]
Honey, can't you remember? We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender, when you gave me your heart
Please say you will, play it again
'Cause I love you still, baby this can't be the end

[Chorus]
We had it all (we had it all)
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you, kid (here's lookin' at you, kid)
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo
You might also like[Chorus]
We had it all (we had it all)
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you, kid (here's lookin' at you, kid)
Missing all the things we did [fade]2Embed
