23 ContributorsYou Might Think Lyrics[Verse 1]
You might think I'm crazy
To hang around with you
Maybe you think I'm lucky
To have something to do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I think that you're wild
Inside me is some child

[Chorus 1]
You might think I'm foolish
Or maybe it's untrue (you might think)
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
All I want is you

[Verse 2]
You might think it's hysterical
But I know when you're weak
You think you're in the movies
And everything's so deep

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I think that you're wild
When you flash that fragile smile
You might also like[Chorus 2]
You might think it's foolish
What you put me through (you might think)
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
All I want is you

[Bridge]
And it was hard, so hard to take
There's no escape without a scrape
But you kept it going till the sun fell down
You kept it going

[Verse 3]
Well, you might think I'm delirious
The way I run you down
But somewhere sometimes, when you're curious
I'll be back around

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Oh, I think that you're wild
And so uniquely styled

[Chorus 3]
You might think it's foolish
This chancy rendezvous
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
But all I want is you
[Refrain]
All I want is you
All I want is you3Embed
