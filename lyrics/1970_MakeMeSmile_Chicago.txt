13 ContributorsBallet For A Girl In Buchannon: I. Make Me Smile Lyrics[Verse 1: Terry Kath]
Children play in the park, they don't know
I'm alone in the dark, even though
Time and time again I see your face smiling inside

[Chorus 1: Bandmates, (Terry Kath), All]
I'm so happy (Uh huh)
That you love me (Oh yeah)
Life is lovely (It is, oh)
When you're near me
Tell me, you will stay?
Make me smile

[Verse 2: Terry Kath]
Living life is just a game, so they say, hey
All the games we used to play
Fade away, ooh
We may now enjoy those dreams we shared so long ago

[Chorus 2: Bandmates, (Terry Kath), All]
Oh, my darling (Oh, oh)
Got to have you (Yeah, yeah)
Feel the magic (Ooh, ooh, whoa)
When I hold you (Hold you)
Cry sweet tears of joy
Touch the sky

[Chorus 3: Terry Kath]
Now I need you
More than ever
No more crying
We're together
Tell me, you will stay
Make me smile2Embed
