11 ContributorsHooked on a Feeling Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't stop this feelin'
Deep inside of me
Girl, you just don't realize
What you do to me

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hold me in your arms so tight
You let me know everything's alright

[Chorus]
I
I'm hooked on a feelin'
High on believin'
That you're in love with me

[Verse 2]
Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
Girl, you keep me thirsty
For another cup of wine

[Verse 3]
I got it bad for you, girl
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure

Keep it up girl, yeah you turn me on

[Chorus]
I
I'm hooked on a feelin'
High on believin'
That you're in love with me

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
All the good love when we're all alone
Keep it up girl, yeah you turn me on

[Chorus]
I
I'm hooked on a feelin'
I'm high on believin'
That you're in love with me3Embed
