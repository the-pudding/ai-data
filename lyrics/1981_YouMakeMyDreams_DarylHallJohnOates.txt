What I want
You've got and it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah
What I've got
Full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
And you pull them all together
And, uh, how? I can't explain

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, well, well, you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
You make my dreams come true
You (You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you)
Well, well, well, you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, yeah, you make my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you) Well, yeah

[Verse 2]
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer, I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out and wrap yourself around me
'Cause I, I ain't the way you found me and I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, well, 'cause you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) Mm-hmm
You make my dreams come true
Oh, yeah (You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you)
Well, well, well, you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) Ooh-ooh
You make my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you) Oh, yeah
Well, listen to this
Ow
