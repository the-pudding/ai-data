We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just hope you're lyin' next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then, I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Ooh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez, Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
(We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
(We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
Like we used to do
[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's givin' it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
(We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
(We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Selena Gomez, Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
We don't talk anymore, oh, oh
(Don't wanna know)
(What kind of dress you're wearin' tonight)
(If he's holdin' onto you so tight)
The way I did before
We don't talk anymore, oh, woah
(I overdosed, should've known your love was a game)
(Now I can't get you outta my brain)
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore73Embed
