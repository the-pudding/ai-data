15 ContributorsHalf-Breed Lyrics[Verse 1]
My father married a pure Cherokee
My mother's people were ashamed of me
The Indians said that I was white by law
The white man always called me "Indian Squaw"

[Chorus]
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, 'she's no good,' they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

[Verse 2]
We never settled, went from town to town
When you're not welcome you don't hang around
The other children always laughed at me
"Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee"

[Chorus]
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, 'she's no good,' they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

[Verse 3]
We weren't accepted and I felt ashamed
Nineteen, I left them, tell me who's to blame?
My life since then has been from man to man
But I can't run away from what I am
You might also like[Chorus]
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, 'she's no good,' they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

[Outro]
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, 'she's no good,' they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was bornEmbed
