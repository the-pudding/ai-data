Ballerina girl

[Verse 1]
You are so lovely
With you standing there
I'm so aware
Of how much I care for you
You are more than now
You are for always
I can see in you my dreams come true
Don't you ever go away
You make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
And when I hold you
I only want to say
I love you

[Chorus]
Ballerina girl

[Verse 2]
The joy you bring me
Every day and night
Holding you tight
How I've waited for your love
Sometimes I've wondered
If you'd ever come my way
Now that I've finally found you
This is where my heart will stay whoa

I'm never going to break your heart
Never will we drift apart
Because all I want to do
Is share my whole life with you
Because you make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
I guess I finally realized
There's nothing else like loving you

[Chorus]
Ballerina girl

[Bridge]
You are so lovely
I can see in you
My dreams come true
Don't you ever go away

[Chorus]
