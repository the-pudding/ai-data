Because I've done everything I can
I hope that you
Will say that I'm your loving man

Make up your mind
And do what you're gonna do
Well you know how I feel
So I'm leaving it up to you

It's all so clear
That I would give everything I own
To have you near
Never leave me all alone

I need your love
So, darling, please be fair
Let me know where I stand
And I hope that you say you care

Well I've laid my cards on the table
And it's oh so plain to see
That I'm ready, willing and able
To love you faithfully

It's up to you
No, it's not for me to say
You love me too
Oh, but I hope you feel that way
You might also likeMake up your mind
And do what you're gonna do
Well you know how I feel
So I'm leaving it up to you

Make up your mind
And do what you're gonna do
Well you know how I feel
So I'm leaving it up to you

It's up to you
Darling, it's up to you
Baby, it's up to you
Darling, it's up to you

Baby, it's up to you
Darling, it's up to you
Baby, it's up to youEmbed
