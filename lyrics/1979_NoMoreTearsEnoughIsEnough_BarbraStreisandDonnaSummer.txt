8 ContributorsNo More Tears (Enough Is Enough) Lyrics[Barbra]
Hmmm, hmmm hmmm
Oooh oooh ooh
It's raining, it's pouring
My love life is boring me to tears
After all these years

[Donna]
No sunshine, no moonlight
No stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

[Barbra]
I always dreamed I'd find the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
I've loved
I've loved

[Barbra & Donna]
Raining (Raining)
Pouring (Pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear
Ah ah ah hey hey ah

[Donna]
If you've had enough
Don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it
You might also like[Barbra]
If you've had your fill
Get the check, pay the bill
You can do it

[Donna]
Tell him to just get out

[Barbra]
Nothing left to talk about

[Donna]
Pack his raincoat, show him out

[Barbra & Donna]
Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough (Enough)
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough (Enough)
I've loved
I've loved

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough
[Donna]
If you've reached the end
Don't pretend that is right when it's over

[Barbra]
(It's over)
If the feeling is gone
Don't think twice just move on
Get it over

[Donna]
(Over, over)

[Barbra & Donna]
Tell him to just get out
Say it clearly, spell it out:
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

[Barbra]
I always dreamed I'd found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
I've loved (I had no choice from the start)
I've loved (I've gotta listen to my heart)
I've loved (Tearing us apart)
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

[Barbra & Donna]
No more tears (No more tears)
No more tears (No more tears)
No more tears (No more tears)
No more tears (No more tears)
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it, she's had it, we've had it

[Donna]
I always dreamed I'd found the perfect lover

[Barbra]
But he turned out to be like every other man

[Barbra & Donna]
I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar

It's raining, it's pouring
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

No more tears
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
Is enough!Embed
