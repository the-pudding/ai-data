19 ContributorsBrand New Key Lyrics[Verse 1]
I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you got somethin' I need

[Chorus]
Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them out to see
I've been lookin' around awhile
You got somethin' for me
Oh, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key

[Verse 2]
I ride my bike, I roller skate, don't drive no car
Don't go too fast but I go pretty far
For somebody who don't drive
I've been all around the world
Some people say I done alright for a girl

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

I asked your mother if you were at home
She said yes, but you weren't alone
Oh, sometimes I think that you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you got somethin' I need

[Chorus]
Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them out to see
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la, la
Oh, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key6Embed
