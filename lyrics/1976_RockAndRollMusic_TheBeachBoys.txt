10 ContributorsRock and Roll Music Lyrics[Chorus]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 1]
I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she could hear my man a-wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they was blowing like a hurricane
See The Beach Boys LiveGet tickets as low as $31You might also like[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 3]
Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

[Chorus]
They started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old way you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Outro]
Say, if you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
It's got to be some of that
If you wanna dance with meEmbed
