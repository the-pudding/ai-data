33 ContributorsFather Figure Lyrics[Verse 1]
That's all I wanted, something special
Something sacred in your eyes
For just one moment to be bold and naked
At your side

[Refrain]
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me (Understand me)
Maybe this time is forever
Say it can be, woah-woah, oh

[Verse 2]
That's all you wanted, somethin' special
Someone sacred in your life
Just for one moment, to be warm and naked
At my side

[Refrain]
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me (Understand me)
But somethin' tells me together
We'd be happy, woah-woah, baby

[Chorus]
I will be your father figure (Oh, baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine (I'd love to)
I will be your preacher, teacher (Be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind (It would make me)
I will be your father figure (Very happy)
I have had enough of crime (Please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time (Of time)

That's all I wanted, but sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime
That's all I wanted, just to see my baby's
Blue eyes shine

[Refrain]
This time I think that my lover
Understands me (Understands me), hee
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be strong, baby

[Chorus]
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine (My baby)
I will be your preacher, teacher
Anything you have in mind (Hee)
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time

[Bridge]
If you are the desert, I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger, hunger for me
Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared, but then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling, don't think of me, because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes
Baby (Baby, baby)
And love can't lie, no
Greet me with the eyes of a child
My love is always tellin' me so
Heaven is a kiss and a smile
Just hold on, hold on, and I won't let you go, my baby
[Chorus]
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher, teacher
I'm everything you have in mind, baby
I will be your father figure
And I have had enough of crime
So I am gonna love you
'Til the end of time

[Outro]
I will be your father (I will be your)
I will be your preacher (Father)
I will be your father (I'll be your daddy, oh)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time7Embed
