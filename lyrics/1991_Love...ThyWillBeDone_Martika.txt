11 ContributorsLove... Thy Will Be Done Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love... Thy will be done
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run
No longer can I resist the guiding light
That gives me the power to keep up the fight
Oh, Love... Thy will be done
Since I have found you, my life has just begun
And I see all of Your creations as one perfect complex
No one less beautiful or more special than the next
We are all blessed and so wise to accept
Thy will, Love, be done

[Verse 2]
Love... Thy will be mine
And make me strive for the glorious and divine
I could not be more, more satisfied (Satisfied)
Even when there's no peace outside my window, there's peace inside
And that's why I no longer run (I no longer run)
Love... Thy will be done

[Verse 3]
Love... Thy will be done
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run
Oh Love... Thy will be done
Thy will, Love, be done

Oh, no longer can I resist (No)
The guiding light (Guiding light)
The light that gives me power to keep up the fight
I couldn't be more satisfied (No)
Even when there's no peace outside my window, there is peace inside
And that's why I can no longer run
Love, thy will be done
Love, thy will be done
Love, thy will be done
Oh!

[Verse 4]
Love... Thy will be done
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run
Oh Love... Thy will be done
Thy will, Love, be done

[Verse 5]
Oh Love... Thy will be done
I can no longer hide, I can no longer run
Oh Love... Thy will be done (Sing it)
Thy will, Love, be done (Glory, glory, glory)
Thy will, Love, be done (Glory)
Thy will, Love, be done1Embed
