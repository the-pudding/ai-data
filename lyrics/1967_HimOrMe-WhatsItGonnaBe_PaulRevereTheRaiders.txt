3 ContributorsHim or Me (Whatâ€™s It Gonna Be?) Lyrics[Chorus]
Now, have you got yourself
A brand new baby?
Don't tell me maybe
Is it so? I got to know
What's it gonna be?
Him or me? Him or me?
Him or me? Him or me?

[Verse 1]
I can still recall
When you told me I was all
Everything you looked for in a man
But I know that it's not true
I've seen the way he looks at you
And I think you're gonna hang me up again

[Chorus]
Now, have you got yourself
A brand new baby?
Don't tell me maybe
Is it so? I got to know
What's it gonna be?
Him or me? Him or me?
Him or me? Him or me?

So, girl, if you'd like to be so kind
Would you please make up your mind?
I won't share your lovin' with another man
And if you see things my way
Could you let me know today?
But if you decide it's him, I'll change my plans

[Chorus]
So now you've got yourself
A brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe
Is it so? I got to know
What's it gonna be?
Him or me? Him or me?
Him or me? Him or me?

[Outro]
Him or me? Him or me?
Him or me? What's it gonna be?
Him or me? Him or me?
Him or me? What's it gonna be?
Him or me? Him or me?
Him or me? What's it gonna be?
Oh, him or me? Him or me?
Him or me? What's it gonna be...?Embed
