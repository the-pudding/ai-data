7 ContributorsIâ€™m Sorry Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you
Almost everyday
Thinking about the good times
Thinking about the rain
Thinking about how bad it feels
Alone again

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for the way things are in China
I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be
But more than anything else, I'm sorry for myself
'Cause you're not here with me

[Verse 2]
Our friends all ask about you, I say you're doing fine
And I expect to hear from you almost anytime
But they all know I'm crying and I can't sleep at night
They all know I'm dying down deep inside

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for all the lies I've told you
I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
I can't believe you went away

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
If I took some things for granted
I'm sorry
For the chains I put on you
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
For living without you
It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you almost every day3Embed
