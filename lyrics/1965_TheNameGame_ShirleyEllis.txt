[Verse 3]
Come on, everybody
I say now, let's play a game
I betcha I could make a rhyme
Out of anybody's name
The first letter of the name
I treat it like it wasn't there
But a "B" or an "F"
Or an "M" will appear
And then I say "bo", add a "B", then I say the name
Then "bo-na-na fanna" and "fo"
And then I say the name again with an "F" very plain
Then a "fee fi" and a "mo"
And then I say the name again with an "M" this time
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme

Arnold
Arnold, Arnold, bo-bar-nold
Bo-na-na fanna fo-far-nold
Fee fi mo-mar-nold
Arnold

[Verse 5]
But if the first two letters are ever the same
I drop them both, then say the name
Like Bob, Bob, drop the B's, Bo-ob
Or Fred, Fred, drop the F's, Fo-red
Or Mary, Mary, drop the M's, Mo-ary
That's the only rule that is contrary
Okay, now say "bo" (Bo)
Now Tony with a "B" (Bo-ney)
Then bo-na-na fanna and fo (Bo-na-na fanna fo)
Then you say the name again with an "F" very plain (Fo-ney)
Then a fee fi and a mo (Fee fi mo)
Then you say the name again with an "M" this time (Mo-ney)
And there isn't any name that you can't rhyme

[Verse 6]
Everybody do Tony
Tony, Tony, bo-bo-ney
Bo-na-na fanna fo-fo-ney
Fee fi mo-mo-ney
Tony

Bo-na-na fanna fo-fil-ly
Fee fi mo-mil-ly

Bo-na-na fanna fo-far-sha
Fee fi mo-ar-sha

A little trick with Nick

Bo-na-na fanna fo-fick
Fee fi mo-mick
Nick
