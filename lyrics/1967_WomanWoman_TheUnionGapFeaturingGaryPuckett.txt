4 ContributorsWoman, Woman Lyrics[Chorus]
Woman, oh, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?
On your mind

[Verse 1]
Something's wrong between us
That your laughter cannot hide
And you're afraid to let your eyes meet mine
And lately when I love you
I know you're not satisfied

[Chorus]
Woman, oh, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?
On your mind

[Verse 2]
I've seen the way men look at you
When they think I don't see
And it hurts to have them think that you're that kind
But it's knowing that you're looking back
That's really killing me

[Chorus]
Woman, oh, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?
On your mind
You might also like[Verse 3]
A woman wears a certain look
When she is on the move
And a man can always tell what's on her mind
I hate to have to say it
But that look's all over you

[Chorus]
Woman, oh, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?
Oh, woman, oh, woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?Embed
