5 ContributorsWhoâ€™s Holding Donna Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes a love won't let go
Hard as I try I know it shows
Everybody's telling me
You'll be over her eventually
But how am I supposed to feel so secure?

[Chorus]
When I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes somehow
And I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
What magic can be found
To turn me back to the one
Who's holding Donna now

[Verse 2]
The letter started with goodbye
I've read it half a million times
Tell me this is just a dream
When I wake up she'll be here next to me
Tell me it will be just the way it was, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
What magic can be found
To turn me back to the one
Who's holding Donna now

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Who's holding Donna now
I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right now
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Who's holding Donna now
(Oh, Donna)
What magic can be found
To make me the one
Who's holding Donna now
(I can't get Donna off my mind)
Who's holding Donna now
I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right nowEmbed
