Drop your silver in my tambourine
Help a poor man build a pretty dream
Give me pennies, I'll take anything
Now listen while I play
My green tambourine

[Verse 2]
Watch the jingle jangle start to shine
Reflections of the music that is mine
When you toss a coin, you'll hear it sing
Now listen while I play
My green tambourine

[Verse 3]
Drop a dime before I walk away
Any song you want, I'll gladly play
Money feeds my music machine
Now listen while I play
My green tambourine

[Outro]
Listen and I'll playYou might also like2Embed
