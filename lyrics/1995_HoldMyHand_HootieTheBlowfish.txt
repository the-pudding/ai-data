With a little love and some tenderness
We'll walk upon the water, we'll rise above the mess
With a little peace and some harmony
We'll take the world together, we'll take 'em by the hand

[Refrain]
'Cause I got a hand for you, oh
'Cause I wanna run with you

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, I saw you standin' there
Your head was down, your eyes were red, no comb had touched your hair
I said get up and let me see you smile
We'll take a walk together, walk the road awhile, 'cause

[Refrain]
'Cause I got a hand for you
(I got a hand for you)
'Cause I wanna run with you
(Won't you let me run with you? Yeah)

[Chorus]
(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand
(Hold my hand) I'll take you to a place where you can be
(Hold my hand) Anything you wanna be because
I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can

See I was wasted and I was a-wastin' time
'Til I thought about your problems, I thought about your crimes
Then I stood up and then I screamed aloud
I don't wanna be part of your problems, don't wanna be part of your crowd, no

[Refrain]
'Cause I got a hand for you
(I got a hand for you)
'Cause I wanna run with you
(Ah, won't you let me run with you?)

[Chorus]
(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand
(Hold my hand) I'll take you to the promised land
(Hold my hand) Maybe we can't change the world, but
I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can, yeah

[Interlude]
Oh
Let me run, won't you let me run, run, run, run

[Chorus]
(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand
(Hold my hand) I'll take you to a place where you can be
(Hold my hand) Anything you wanna be because
I... oh no-no, no no no
[Chorus]
(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand
(Hold my hand) I'll make it to a promised land
(Hold my hand) Maybe we can't change the world, but
I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can

[Outro]
Oh
The best that I can10Embed
