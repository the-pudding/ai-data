15 ContributorsBe Thankful for What You Got Lyrics[Verse 1]
Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Gangsta whitewalls
TV antennas in the back
You may not have a car at all
But remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you got
Though you may not drive a great big Cadillac

[Chorus]
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean

[Verse 2]
Gangsta whitewalls
TV antennas in the back
You may not have a car at all
But remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you got

[Chorus]
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean
Wooh-ooh-ooh
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean
Wooh-ooh-ooh
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean
Wooh-ooh-ooh
