Garnet Mimms & the Enchanters
Cry cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Welcome back home
Now he told you, that he loved you much more than I
But he left you and you don't you just don't know why
And when you don't know what to do
You come running and
Cry cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Welcome back home
Well I can always lose
Don' you know nobody can love you the way that I do
Take the pain and the heartache too
Ah honey you know that I'll be around
When you need to
Cry cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Welcome back home
Welcome back home
SPOKEN:
I've spent so many nights
Just waiting for you to come walking through that door
And even tho you've made a fool of me so many times before
I know that all it takes is just the sight of your face
To make me realize that I will always love you darlin
And I can see that you got some more tears to shed
I can see it baby, cause your eyes, your eyes are getting red
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon c'mon
Cry cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Cry cry baby, cry baby, cry babyYou might also likeEmbed
