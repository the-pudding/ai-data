"Is this the train to Desert Moon?"
Was all she said
But I knew I'd heard
That stranger's voice before
I turned to look into her eyes
But she moved away

[Pre-Chorus]
She was standing in the rain
Trying hard to speak my name
They say first love never runs dry

[Verse 2]
The waiter poured our memories
Into tiny cups
We stumbled over words
We longed to hear
We talked about the dreams we'd lost
Or given up

[Pre-Chorus]
When a whistle cut the night
And shook silence from our lives
As the last train rolled towards the dune
You might also like[Chorus]
Those summer nights
When we were young
We bragged of things
We'd never done
We were dreamers
Only dreamers
And in our haste
To grow too soon
We left our innocence
On Desert Moon
We were dreamers
Only dreamers

[Bridge]
On Desert Moon
On Desert Moon
On Desert Moon
Desert Moon

[Verse 3]
I still can hear the whisper of the summer night
It echoes in the corners
Of my heart
The night we stood and waited for the desert train
[Pre-Chorus]
All the words we meant to say
All the chances swept away
Still remain on the road to the dune

[Chorus]
Those summer nights
When we were young
We bragged of things
We'd never done
We were dreamers
Only dreamers
Moments pass
And time moves on
But dreams remain
For just as long
As there's dreamers
All the dreamers

[Outro]
On Desert Moon
On Desert Moon
On Desert Moon
