10 ContributorsOn Broadway Lyrics[Verse 1]
They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walking down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

[Verse 2]
They say the women treat you right on Broadway
But looking at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how you gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes

[Verse 3]
They say I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit 'til I'm a star on Broadway

[Outro]
I won't quit 'til I'm a star on Broadway
No, no, no, no
Not gon' quit 'til I'm a star, 'cause I know I can, can, can, can now
[Scatting]
On Broadway
On Broadway
Ooh, on Broadway
[Scatting]
Broadway, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, mmm
