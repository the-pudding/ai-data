9 ContributorsWar Lyrics[Intro]
If you grew up in the sixties
You grew up with war on TV every night
The war that your friends were involved in
And uh, I wanna do this song tonight for all the young people out there
If you're in your teens
'Cause I remember
A lot of my friends when we were seventeen or eighteen we didn't
Have much of a chance to think about how we felt about a lot of things
And uh, the next time
They're gonna be lookin' at you
And you're gonna need a lot of information to know
What you're gonna wanna do
Because in 1985
Blind faith in your leaders or in anything will get you killed
'Cause what I'm talkin' about here is

[Chorus]
War, huh (Yeah yeah yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War, huh (Yeah yeah yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Come on

War is something that I despise
For it means the destruction of innocent lives
And thousand words in mothers' cry
When their sons go out to fight to give their lives

[Chorus]
War, huh (Woah woah yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War, huh (No no yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

[Post-Chorus]
War
It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War
Friend only to the undertaker

[Verse 2]
Yeah, war is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of war just blows my mind
Handed down from generation to generation
Induction, destruction, who wants to die?
[Chorus]
War, huh (Woah woah no)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War, huh (Yeah yeah yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Come on now

[Post-Chorus]
War
It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War
Friend only to the undertaker

[Verse 3]
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is too precious to be fighting wars each day
War can't give life, it can only take it away

[Chorus]
War, huh (Oh oh yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War, huh (Good God, y'all)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
[Verse 4]
Peace, love and understanding all
There must be some place for these things today
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord, there's gotta be another way that's better than

[Chorus]
War, huh (Oh oh yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War, huh (Good God)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Come on now
War, huh (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War, huh (Oh yeah)
What is it good for?
Nothing
