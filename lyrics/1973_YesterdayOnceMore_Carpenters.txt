25 ContributorsYesterday Once More Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was young, I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played, I'd sing along
It made me smile

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Those were such happy times
And not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again
Just like a long-lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

[Chorus 1]
Every "sha-la-la-la"
Every "whoa, whoa-oh" still shines
Every "shing-a-ling-a-ling"
That they're starting to sing so fine
When they get to the part
Where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before, it's yesterday once more
(Shoobie-doo, lang, lang)
(Shoobie-doo, lang, lang)

Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was songs of love
That I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
Still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

[Chorus 2]
Every "sha-la-la-la"
Every "whoa, whoa-oh" still shines
(Only oldies, but goodies)
Every "shing-a-ling-a-ling"
That they're starting to sing so fine
All my best memories
Come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
Just like before, it's yesterday once more
(Shoobie-doo, lang, lang)
[Outro]
Every "sha-la-la-la"
Every "whoa, whoa-oh" still shines
Every "shing-a-ling-a-ling"
That they're starting to sing so fine
Every "sha-la-la-la"
Every "whoa, whoa-oh" still shines
Every "shing-a-ling-a-ling"
That they're starting to sing so fine...4Embed
