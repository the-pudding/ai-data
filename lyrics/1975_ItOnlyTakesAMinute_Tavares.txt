6 ContributorsIt Only Takes a Minute LyricsYeah yeah

What's an hour of the day?
We throw at least one away
Walk the streets half a year
Tryin' to find a new career

Now if you get a flu attack
For 30 days you're on your back
Through the night I'll sing and dance
Baby, give me half a chance

It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, let's fall in love

Now in the unemployment lines
You can spend your life readin' signs
Waitin' for your interview
They can shoot the whole day for you
(Yeah)

Now winter's gonna turn to spring
And you haven't accomplished a thing
(Haven't accomplished a thing)
So baby, leave a little time
'Cause you never know what's on my mind, yeah

To fall in love, to fall in love

To fall in love, let's fall in love

Well, you find yourself a few minutes (Fall in love)
When you wanna fry yourself an egg (Fall in love)
Now, you spare a few seconds girl (Fall in love)
When you see, when you see a man beg (Fall in love)

Now it takes some time (Fall in love)
To go down to the corner store (Fall in love)
Well, what I've got in mind girl (Fall in love)
Give me 60 seconds, no more (Fall in love)

Oh, it only takes a minute girl (Baby)
To fall in love, to fall in love
