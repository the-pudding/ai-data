1 ContributorThe Get Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
4AM, I'm on the North side of Woolley
Yeah I've been stunting but I'm ready to do this fully
It's a shame niggas hate on me, I've got a nooky
Ain't from the hood, only hood you know is your hoodie
They be stunting on the Gram yo, stunting on the Gram doe
Showing all your assets, looking like a Instagram hoe
Really ain't that deep
Bio says 'Pussy on fleek' but that couldn't keep your man doe
Killing all these beats, producers might need a medic
Let them have it monthly like I be building my credit
Everything I write know I done it before I said it
Personality Peruvian, yours is looking synthetic
Uh, that's on some real shit
'Cause this that 2000 and fake, I want some realness
It's like these chickens don't wanna support a real bitch
Ain't gotta touch it but I know you're gonna feel this
Like what a feeling, seeing something that you want and you can cop it
Or looking at the biggest crowd and knowing that you can rock it
Or seeing niggas hating but you're moving and they can't stop it
All I want is to progress, turning my passions into profit

[Hook]
Uh, that money made my niggas rob the top shotter
That money turn your bitch into a cock-sucker
What? She giving head for some red-bottoms
Couple weeks later man that bitch got 'em

I put on for my city from the seventeen
Knew exactly what I wanted when I was seventeen
I worked hard for a job and then I was selling green
And now my goals is some type of money you've never seen
Straight touching all of my targets without a laser beam
You're losing out, think it's time to get with the winning team
My niggas get at the money, you're always on the scene
Whipping that work in that kitchen 'cause all they want is cream
Whipped cream and some strawberries
Couple boys that will eat it, I mean I know many
But when you're ripe and looking right that shit is ordinary
I ain't giving all the sut for something momentary
Uh, dream so big, shit is kinda scary
All I want is my notes high like Mariah Carey
My niggas on shit, move diff, be wary
You man are actors, joke man, Jim Carey
I'm tired of pointing out all the things that make you lame
Tryna be players before you even get in the game
Me and my dawgs dem are hungry, no way to be tamed
I'm tryna get my mind right, you better do the same
I've been rolling with J like nothing ever changed
Never forget the ones that taught you how to maintain
I need my license but I'm thinking about wood grain
I want that young money, cash money, Lil Wayne
[Hook]
That money made my niggas rob the top shotter
That money turn your bitch into a cock-sucker
What? She giving head for some red-bottoms
Couple weeks later man that bitch got 'em

[Bridge]
But it's nothing, if my money's right I'll probably cop 'em
New slaves came a long way from picking cotton
Bitches made themselves a target and I ain't forgotten
Full Woolley, you ain't running if I fix dot 'emEmbed
