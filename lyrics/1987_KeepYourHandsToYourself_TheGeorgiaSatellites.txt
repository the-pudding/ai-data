16 ContributorsKeep Your Hands to Yourself Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got a little change in my pocket going jing-a-ling-a-ling
Wanna call you on the telephone, baby, I give you a ring
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding ring"

[Chorus]
My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

[Verse 2]
Ooh, baby, baby, baby
Why you gonna treat me this way?
You know I'm still your loverboy
I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said
"No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding vow"

[Chorus]
My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

(Oh go, man go!)

[Verse 3]
Over here
You see, I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talking about true love
Started talking about sin
I said
"Honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life"
She said
"No huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife"

[Chorus]
My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"Embed
