11 ContributorsEverything I Own Lyrics[Verse 1]
You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

[Chorus]
And I would give anything I own
Would give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

[Verse 2]
You taught me how to love
What it's of, what it's of
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go
You might also like[Chorus]
And I would give anything I own
Would give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

[Bridge]
Is there someone you know
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted?
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words
You long to say

[Chorus]
I would give anything I own
Would give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

[Post-Chorus]
Just to touch you once again6Embed
