You've got the love
You've got the power
But you just don't understand
Girl, you've been charging by the hour
For your love

I'm tryin' to show how much I love you
Still believin' in romance
You're taking way too many chances
With my love

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember
When you used to be
The talk of the town
All you'd get is lonely

[Chorus]
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around

[Verse 2]
Without the woman I can make it
But I need the girl to stay
Oh, don't you let the lady take it
All away
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When the woman needs
A taste of yesterday
And he stays at home
All they get is lonely

[Chorus]
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)

[Bridge]
Oh, girl you know me
I'm alone until you show me
That you're still in love with me
We're gonna make it
We're gonna take it
Back where we belong

[Chorus]
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)
[Outro]
Turn your love around
(It's time the girl became a woman)
Don't you turn me down
(Every woman needs a man)
I can show you how
(I love the girl, I love the woman)
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)
Turn your love around
(It's time the girl became a woman)
Don't you turn me down
(Every woman needs a man)
I can show you how
(I love the girl, I love the woman)
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)
Turn your love around
(It's time the girl became a woman)
Don't you turn me down
(Every woman needs a man)
I can show you how
(I love the girl, I love the woman)1Embed
