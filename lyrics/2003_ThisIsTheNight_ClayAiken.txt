7 ContributorsThis is the Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the world wasn't upside down
I could take all the time I had
But I'm not gonna wait when a moment can vanish so fast
'Cause every kiss is a kiss you can never get back

[Chorus]
Lift me up in your eyes
If you told me that is what heaven is
Well, you'd be right
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

[Verse 2]
When the answer to all my dreams
Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here holding back what I'm trying to say?

[Chorus]
Lift me up in your eyes
If you told me that is what heaven is
Well, you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night
You might also like[Bridge]
This is the night where we capture forever
And all our tomorrows begin
After tonight, we will never be lonely again

[Chorus]
Lift me up in your eyes
If you told me that is what heaven is
Well, you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the nightEmbed
