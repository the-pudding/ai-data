21 ContributorsDamaged Lyrics[Verse 1: Shannon & D. Woods]
Do, do you got a first aid kit handy
Do, do you know how to patch up a wound, tell me
A-a-a-are you, are you patient, understanding
'Cause I might need some time to clear the hole in my heart and I
(I tried every remedy and nothing seems to work for me)
Baby (Baby), this situation's drivin' me
Crazy (Crazy) and I really wanna be your
Lady (Lady), but the one before you left me so

[Chorus: All, Dawn]
Damaged (Damaged), damaged (Damaged)
I thought that I should let you know that my heart is
Damaged (Damaged), so damaged (So damaged)
And you can blame the one before
So, how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (Baby, I gotta know)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (What are you gonna do, baby)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (Baby, I gotta know)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (What are you gonna do)

[Verse 2: Aundrea & Aubrey]
Do, do you got a first aid kit handy
Do, do you know how to patch up a wound, tell me
A-a-a-are you, are you patient, understanding
'Cause I might need some time to clear the hole in my heart and I
You try to gain my trust, talking is not enough
Actions speak louder than words, you gotta show me something
My heart is missing some pieces
I need this puzzle put together again
