8 ContributorsThe Hardest Thing Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
We both know that I shouldn't be here
This is wrong
And, baby, it's killing me, it's killing you
Both of us trying to be strong
I've got somewhere else to be
Promises to keep
Someone else who loves me
And trusts me fast asleep

[Pre-Chorus]
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that

[Chorus]
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye, and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (Oh, ho)
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you
You might also like[Verse 2]
I know that we'll meet again
Fate has a place and time
So you can get on with your life
I've got to be cruel to be kind
Like Dr. Zhivago
All my love I'll be sending
And you will never know
'Cause there can be no happy ending

[Chorus]
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye, and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you

[Interlude]
Maybe another time, another day
As much as I want to, I can't stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-ho, I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that
[Chorus]
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (Oh)
To look you in the eye, and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion (Oh no) when you start to cry (Oh, baby, yeah)
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be, oh no
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (Oh-ho)
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love youEmbed
