Mmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Doesn't matter at all

[Verse 1]
Doesn't matter what your friends are telling you
Doesn't matter what my family's saying too
It just matters that I'm in love with you
It only matters that you love me too
It doesn't matter if they won't accept you
I'm accepting of you and the things you do
Just as long as it's you
Nobody but you, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
My love for you
Unconditional love too
Gotta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
And show you that it

[Chorus]
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
No, doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're in love with me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Oh, doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're nutty, nutty, nutty for me

(You're so kind)
Just what I asked for, you're so loving and kind
(You're all mine)
And I can't believe you're mine

[Verse 2]
Doesn't matter if you're feeling insecure
Doesn't matter if you're feeling so unsure
'Cause I'll take away the doubt within your heart
And show that my love will never hurt or harm
Doesn't matter what the pain we go through
Doesn't matter if the money's gone too
Just as long as I'm with you
Nobody but you, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Your love for me
Unconditional I see
Gotta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
And show you that it

[Chorus]
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
No, doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're in love with me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Oh, doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're nutty, nutty, nutty for me
