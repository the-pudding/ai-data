7 ContributorsEvery Heartbeat Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Ooh
Ooh)
Hear me speak what's on my mind
Let me give this testimony
Reaffirm that you will find
That you are my one and only
No exception to this rule
I'm simple
But I'm no fool
I've got a witness happy to say

[Chorus]
Every hour
Every day
Every heartbeat bears your name
Loud and clear
They stake my claim
My red blood runs true blue
And every heartbeat belongs to you
Ah

[Verse 2]
Classic case of boy meets girl
Moving in the same direction
You're not asking for the world
I'm not asking for perfection
Just a love that's well designed
For passing the test of time
I'm here to tell you
I'm here to stay
