7 ContributorsIf You Love Me (Let Me Know) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passin' day
Before too long, I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay

[Chorus]
If you love me, let me know
If you don't, then let me go (Ooh, I)
I can't take another minute
Of the day without you in it
If you love me, let it be
If you don't, then set me free
Take the chains away that keep me lovin' you (Lovin' you)

[Verse 2]
The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says "hello, it's good to see you"
Any time I turn around to find you there

[Verse 3]
It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see?
You know you have whatever's mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be
You might also like[Chorus]
If you love me, let me know
If you don't, then let me go (Ooh, I)
I can't take another minute
Of the day without you in it
If you love me, let it be
If you don't, then set me free
Take the chains away that keep me lovin' you (Lovin' you)

[Outro]
Ah, take the chains away that keep me lovin' you (Lovin' you)Embed
