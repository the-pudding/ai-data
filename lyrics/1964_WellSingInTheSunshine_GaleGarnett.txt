We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way

[Verse 1]
I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll stay with you one year

[Chorus]
And we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh everyday
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way

[Verse 2]
I'll sing to you each morning
I'll kiss you every night
But, darlin', don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight

[Chorus]
But we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh everyday
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way
You might also like[Verse 3]
My daddy he once told me
"Hey, don't you love you any man
Just take what they may give you
And give but what you can."

[Chorus]
And you can sing in the sunshine
You'll laugh everyday
You'll sing in the sunshine
Then be on your way

[Verse 4]
And when a year has ended
And I have gone away
You'll often speak about me
And this is what you'll say

[Chorus]
We sang in the sunshine
You know we laughed everyday
We sang in the sunshine
Then she went on her wayEmbed
