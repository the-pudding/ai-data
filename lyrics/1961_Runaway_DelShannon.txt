As I walk along I wonder
A-what went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong
And as I still walk on
I think of the things we've done together
A-while our hearts were young

[Chorus]
I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away
And I wonder
A-where she will stay-ay
My little runaway
A-run, run, run, run, runaway

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
I wonder
I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away
And I wonder
A-where she will stay-ay

A-run, run, run, run, runaway12Embed
