All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don't you know?
If they move too quick (Oh-way-oh)
They're falling down like a domino
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (Oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

[Pre-Chorus: Vicki Peterson; (All)]
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

[Chorus: Vicki Peterson]
Walk like an Egyptian

[Verse 2: Michael Steele; (All)]
The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around, and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (Oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (Oh-way-oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Michael Steele; (All)]
All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

[Chorus: Michael Steele]
Walk like an Egyptian

[Verse 3: Susanna Hoffs; (All)]
Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard, you know (Oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac
If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (Oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs, cruise down the block
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (Oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

[Pre-Chorus: Susanna Hoffs; (All)]
All the cops in the donut shop say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
[Chorus: Susanna Hoffs]
Walk like an Egyptian
