6 ContributorsYouâ€™re Not Alone Lyrics[Verse 1: Bill Champlin]
I see you there, a silhouette in the moonlight
Looks like you've given up on love
You used to be the face in the spotlight
Now loneliness fits you like a glove
You walk around in your cloak of darkness
Too blind to see the light
Your wings are broken, now your spirit can't take flight

[Chorus: Bill Champlin]
You're not alone, you're not alone
While your heart's still young and free
You're not alone, pick up the phone
And talk to me, baby, you will see
You're not alone

[Verse 2: Bill Champlin]
Pools of sorrow and tears of joy
There's a broken-up girl for every broken-down boy
But you don't want to hear it
You like the rhythm of the blues
Want to be a sad story on the late-night news
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But the world's got troubles worse than you
And everybody else out here gets lonely too
You might also like[Chorus: Bill Champlin]
You're not alone, you're not alone
I've been waiting patiently
No, you're not alone, pick up the phone
And talk to me, baby, you will see

[Verse 3: Bill Champlin]
Although your heart is in pieces
You can't find a reason to try
You're not alone, while I'm still standing by

[Chorus: Bill Champlin]
You're not alone, you're not alone
While your heart's still young and free
You're not alone, pick up the phone
And talk to me, baby, you will see
You're not aloneEmbed
