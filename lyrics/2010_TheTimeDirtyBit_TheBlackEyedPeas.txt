[Chorus: will.i.am, Fergie, Both]
I had the time of my life
And I've never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you
Oh, I had the time of my life
And I've never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you-you

[Verse 1: will.i.am, Fergie]
I-I came up in here to rock
Light a fire, make it hot
I don't wanna take no pictures
I just wanna take some shots
So come on, let's go, let's lose control
Let's do it all night, 'til we can't do it no more
People rockin' to the sound
Turn it up and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top
Until the roof come burnin' down
Yeah, it's hot in here, the temperature
Has got these ladies, gettin' freakier
I got freaky, freaky, baby
I was chillin' with my ladies
I didn't come to get bougie
I came here to get crazy
I was born to get wild, that's my style
If you didn't know that
Well, baby, now you know now

All-All these girls, they like my swagger
They callin' me Mick Jagger
I be rollin' like a Stone, jet-setter, jet-lagger
We ain't messin' with no maggots
Messin' with the baddest
Chicks in the club, honey, what's up?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Yeah, it's gotta be the apl
I'm the mack daddy, y'all
Haters better step back
Ladies, download your app
I'm the party application, rockin' just like that
