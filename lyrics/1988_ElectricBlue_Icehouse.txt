If a boy had a chance
A chance with someone like you
Are you gonna break his heart?
Let him cry for the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

[Chorus]
I just freeze
I just freeze every time
You see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue
On my knees
On my knees
Help me, baby!
Tell me what can I do?
Electric blue

[Verse 2]
Oh! I had a dream
For a moment I believed it was true
Oh! I'd have given anything
Just to be there with you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

[Chorus]
I just freeze
I just freeze every time
You see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue
In too deep
In too deep
Standing here waiting
As I'm breaking in two
Electric blue
I can see
I can see
Can see that it may be
Just a vision of you
Electric blue
On my knees
On my knees
Help me, baby!
Tell me what can I do?
Electric blue

[Bridge]
Help me, baby!
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

[Chorus]
In those eyes
I just freeze
Every time you see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue
In too deep
In too deep
Standing here waiting
As I'm breaking in two
Electric blue
I can see
I can see
Can see that it may be
Just a vision of you
Electric blue
On my knees
On my knees
Help me, baby!
Tell me what can I do?
Electric blue

[Chorus]
In those eyes
I just freeze
Every time you see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue
In too deep
In too deep
Standing here waiting
As I'm breaking in two
Electric blue
I can see
I can see
Can see that it may be
Just a vision of you
Electric blue
On my knees
On my knees
Help me, baby!
Tell me what can I do?
Electric blue
[Outro]
Mmmm, electric blue
