2 ContributorsSkinny Legs And All Lyrics[Verse 1]
Say, man!
Don't walk ahead of that woman like she don't belong to you
Just 'cause her got them little skinny legs
You know that ain't no way to do, hoo-hoo!
He-he-he-he-he-he
You didn't act like that when you had her at home behind closed doors
Alright
Now, you act like you ashamed of woman
Don't even want nobody to know she's yours
But that's alright
You just walk on, baby!
(Hup, hup!) Huh!

[Chorus]
And don't you worry about a doggone thing at all
(Hup, hup!) Because there's some man somewhere
Who'll take you, baby
Skinny legs and all

[Bridge]
I swear
Keep on walkin', baby
Hup, hup!
Show you what I'm talkin' 'bout
Listen to this (Hup!)

Now, who'll take the woman with the skinny legs?
Uh huh
Stand right there baby, I'm gon' give you away in a minute
Come on, somebody please take the lady with the skinny legs?
I don't know
Now, y'all know the lady with skinny legs
Got to have somebody too, now
I don't wanna have her, humph
Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Will somebody please take the lady with the skinny legs, please?
(Hey, Joe!) Yeah, Bobby?
(Why don't you take her?) Shut up, fool!
I don't want no woman with no skinny leg, look here
I thought about givin' this woman to Clyde, but no
So I know the kind-a women Clyde like
Old Leroy'll take her
Say Leroy, you got her!

[Bridge]
Ha-ha!

[Verse 3]
Say, miss lady
Now, why you wanna act like that man ain't yours?
Just 'cause he's walkin' with you
With them raggedy clothes?
Man just forgot to get his suit out the cleaners, that's all
Alright, alright!
You act like that man don't belong to you
Go on over there and kiss him and hold his hand
I will
Huh, say you ain't gon' do what?
I said I am!
That's alright, huh
You just walk on, mister! (Hup, hup!)
[Chorus]
And don't you worry about a doggone thing at all
Hup, hup!
Because there's some woman somewhere, who'll take you
Mister, raggedy clothes and all
Yes they will, just keep on walkin'

[Outro]
Hup, hup!
Huh!
Hup, hup!
Huh!
Hup, hup!
Don't be ashamed of what you got
Hup, hup!
Hup, hup!
'Cause somebody wants what you got
Just as bad as you do, alright
I'm still tryin' to get rid of this lady with the skinny legs
Y'all would just act like it's not a crimeEmbed
