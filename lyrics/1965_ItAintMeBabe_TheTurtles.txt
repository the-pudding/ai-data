Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak, but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

[Chorus]
But it ain't me, babe
A-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Well, it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

[Verse 2]
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only lead you down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more

But it ain't me, babe
A-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Well, it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
No, it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

[Outro]
I said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I said a-no, no, no, it ain't me, babeEmbed
