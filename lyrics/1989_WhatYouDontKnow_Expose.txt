4 ContributorsWhat You Donâ€™t Know Lyrics[Verse 1: Gioia]
"No" is not an answer
One that I might try to understand, you see
Love is only letters
Until you prove your love is here inside for me

[Pre-Chorus: Gioia, All]
Can you feel it? (feel it)
Or can't you see? (can't you see?)
I'll never love someone as much, I know
When you see me (see me)
It's what you get (what you get)
Until I know it's real (ah), it won't change how I feel

[Chorus: All, Gioia]
What you don't know
Might hurt you
What you don't know (don't know, don't know)
If you don't know (if you don't know)
It won't hurt you (don't know)
What you don't know (don't know)
What you don't know might hurt you (what you don't know)

[Verse 2: Gioia, All]
You (you), you play with fire
I know one day, you're gonna be the one to burn
Love (love) is like a game
What goes around comes around, you wait your turn
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Gioia, All]
It's a feelin' (feelin')
To change with time (change with time)
We'll always be together, wait and see
If you know me (know me)
That's what you get (what you get)
Until I know it's real (ah), it won't change how I feel

[Chorus: All, Gioia]
What you don't know
Might hurt you
What you don't know (don't know, don't know)
If you don't know (if you don't know)
It won't hurt you
What you don't know (don't know)
What you don't know might hurt you

What you don't know (don't know)
Might hurt you (don't know)
What you don't know (don't know)
If you don't know (if you don't know)
It won't hurt you
What you don't know (don't know)
What you don't know might hurt you

[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge: All, Gioia]
If you don't know, no, never know
No, I won't let go, hey, hey, hey
If you don't know, no, never know
Not here, not now, not anywhere
If you don't know, no, never know
No, I won't let go, hey, hey, hey
If you don't know, no, never know
If you don't know, you won't let go
What you don't know

[Chorus: All, Gioia]
What you don't know (oh, oh no)
Might hurt you (no-no, no-no, no-no)
What you don't know (don't know, don't know)
If you don't know (oh no)
It won't hurt you (oh no, no-no, no-no)
What you don't know (don't know)
What you don't know might hurt you

What you don't know (woo!)
Might hurt you (no-no, no-no, no-no)
What you don't know (oh no, oh n-no)
(No-no, no-no, no-no)
If you don't know (n-n-n-n-n-no, no, no)
It won't hurt you (n-n-n-n-n-no, no, no)
What you don't know (let me tell you what)
You don't know what hurt you, baby
[Outro: All, Gioia]
What you don't know
Said baby, what you don't know won't hurt you now
I don't wanna hurt you, baby, no
I don't wanna hurt you, baby, no
I don't wanna hurt you, baby, no, no
If you don't know, you won't let go
What you don't know

Na-na-na-na (na-na)
Na-na-na (what you don't know might hurt you)
Na-na-na-na (na-na-na-na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na (na-na)
Na-na-na (what you don't know might hurt you)
Na-na-na-na (na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
What you don't know (na-na)
Might hurt you (what you don't know might hurt you)
What you don't know (oh no)
What you don't know might hurt you
What you don't know, it won't hurt youEmbed
