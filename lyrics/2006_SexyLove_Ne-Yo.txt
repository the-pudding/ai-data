My sexy love
So sexy

[Verse 1]
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch
And I erupt like a volcano and cover her with my love
Baby girl, you make me say

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't think (Of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (Sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (When we do the things we do)
Baby girl, you make me say

[Chorus]
Sexy love
Girl, the things you do (Oh baby, baby)
Keep me sprung
Keep me running back to you
Oh, I love making love to you
Baby girl, you know you're my (Sexy love)

[Verse 2]
I'm so addicted to her
She's the sweetest drug
Just enough
Still too much say that I'm simping
And I'm sprung all of the above
I can't help she makes me say

And I just can't think (Of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (Sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (When we do the things we do)
Baby girl, you make me say

[Chorus]
Sexy love
Girl, the things you do
(Oh baby baby)
Keep me sprung
Keep me running back to you
Oh, I love making love to you
Baby girl, you know you're my (Sexy love)

[Verse 3]
Oh, baby what we do
It makes the sun come up
Keep on lovin' 'til it goes back down
And I don't know what I'd do
If I would lose your touch
That's why I'm always keeping you around
My sexy love

[Chorus]
Sexy love
Girl, the things you do
(Oh baby, baby)
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
Oh, I love making love to you
Baby girl you know you're my (Sexy love)
Sexy love
Girl, the things you do
(Oh baby, baby)
Keep me sprung
Keep me running back to you
Oh, I love making love to you
Baby girl, you know you're my (Sexy love)
