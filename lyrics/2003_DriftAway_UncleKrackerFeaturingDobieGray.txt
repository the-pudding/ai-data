9 ContributorsDrift Away Lyrics[Verse 1: Unckle Kracker]
Day after day, I'm more confused
Yet, I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I'd hate to lose
And I'm feelin' the strain
Oh, ain't it a shame?

[Chorus: Unckle Kracker]
Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Won't you take me away?

[Verse 2: Unckle Kracker]
Beginnin' to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
And I'm countin' on you
You can carry me through

[Chorus: Unckle Kracker]
Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Won't you take me away?

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
When I'm feelin' blue
The guitars come in through to soothe me

I wanna drift away (Won't you take me?)
Take me home
Let me drift away
Won't you take me away?7Embed
