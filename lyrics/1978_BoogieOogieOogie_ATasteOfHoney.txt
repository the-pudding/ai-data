[Verse 1]
If you're thinkin' you're too cool to boogie
Boy oh boy, have I got news for you
Everybody here tonight must boogie
Let me tell ya, you are no exception to the rule

[Chorus]
Get on up on the floor
'Cause we're gonna boogie oogie oogie
Till you just can't boogie no more (No more boogie)
Boogie no more
You can't boogie no more (No more boogie)
Boogie no more, listen to the music

[Verse 2]
There's no time to waste, let's get this show on the road (Ooo)
Listen to the music and let your body flow
The sooner we begin, the longer we've got to groove (Ooo)
Listen to the music and let your body move (This is feeling good)

[Chorus]
Now get on up on the floor
'Cause we're gonna boogie oogie oogie
Till you just can't boogie no more (No more boogie)
Boogie no more
You can't boogie no more (No more boogie)
Boogie no more, listen to my bass here
