I see you and you see me
Watch you blowing the lines when you're making a scene
Oh, girl, you've got to know
What my head overlooks the senses will show to my heart
When it's watching for lies, you can't escape my

[Chorus]
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you, watchin' you, watchin' you, watching you

[Verse 2]
You play with words, you play with love
You can twist it around, baby, that ain't enough
'Cause, girl, I'm gonna know
If you're letting me in or letting me go, don't lie
When you're hurting inside 'cause you can't escape my

[Chorus]
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move, baby
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you, watching you, watching you, watching you
