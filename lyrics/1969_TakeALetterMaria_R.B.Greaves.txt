8 ContributorsTake a Letter Maria Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night as I got home about a half past ten
There was the woman I thought I knew
In the arms of another man
I kept my cool, I ain't no fool
Let me tell you what happened then
I packed some clothes and I walked out
And I ain't going back again

[Chorus]
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gotta start a new life
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta start a new life

[Verse 2]
You've been many things but most of all a good secretary to me
And it's times like this I feel you've always been close to me
Was I wrong to work nights to try to build a good life
All work and no play has just cost me a wife

[Chorus]
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gotta start a new life
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta have a new life

When a man loves a woman it's hard to understand
That she would find more pleasure in the arms of another man
I never really noticed how sweet you are to me
It just so happens I'm free tonight
Would you like to have dinner with me

[Chorus]
Well take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gotta start a new life
Oh, take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta have a new life
Well take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gotta start a new lifeEmbed
