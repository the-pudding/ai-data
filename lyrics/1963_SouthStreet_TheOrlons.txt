Where the dancin' is elite (South Street, South Street)
Side by side we're loose and neat
When we're stompin' down the street
Hurry down, baby she's the hippest street in town!(Oh baby)

Meet me, on South Street, oh yeah, hurry on down
Come on now, meet me on South Street
The hippest street in town
Well you take West Street, East Street, North Avenue
(Cause I know) South Street's the best street
To have a ball with you

Do you hear that groovy beat? (South Street, South Street)
Don't it make you move your feet? (South Street, South Street)
Everybody gathers round
Cause they dig that crazy sound
Now hurry down, baby she's the hippest street in town

(Oh baby) Meet me on South Street, (come on) oh yeah, hurry on down
Come on now, meet me on South Street, the hippest street in town
(Well you take) West Street, East Street, North Avenue
(Cause I know) South Street's the best street
To have a ball with you

(Oh baby) Meet me on South Street, (come on) oh yeah, hurry on down
Come on now, meet me on South Street, the hippest street in town
(Well you take) West Street, East Street, North Avenue
(Cause I know) South Street's the best street
To have a ball with youYou might also likeEmbed
