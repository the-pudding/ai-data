You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
I look around me, and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs

[Refrain: Paul McCartney]
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney]
I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me (I love you)
Now can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me (I love you)
Now can't you see?

[Refrain: Paul ]
What's wrong with that?
I need to know, 'cause here I go again

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
I love you
I love you

Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, love isn't silly, love isn't silly at all

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney]
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one? (I love you)
How can I tell you about my loved one? (I love you)

[Saxophone Riff]

I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me
Say, can't you see?)
