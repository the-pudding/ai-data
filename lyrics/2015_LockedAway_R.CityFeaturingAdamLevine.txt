72 ContributorsLocked Away Lyrics[Produced by Cirkut & Dr. Luke]
[Chorus: Adam Levine & (Theron Thomas)]
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
(Right about now)

[Verse 1:  Theron Thomas]
If a judge 'for life' me, would ya stay by my side?
Or is you gonna say goodbye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life
Shawty, would it be alright?
Come on, show me that you are down

[Pre-Chorus: Timothy Thomas, Theron Thomas]
Now tell me, would you really ride for me?
(Would you really ride for me?)
Baby, tell me, would you die for me?
(Tell me, would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me? (Wassup)
Would you be there to always hold me down?
Tell me, would you really cry for me?
(Would you really cry for me?)
Baby, don't lie to me (Baby, don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything (Wassup)
I wanna know, would you stick around?

[Verse 2: Timothy Thomas]
Skiddly dong, dong, dong, dang
All I want is somebody real, who don't need much
A gyal I know that I can trust
To be here when money low
If I did not have nothing else to give but love
Would that even be enough? (Tell me, tell me, tell me)

[Bridge: Timothy Thomas, Theron Thomas]
Tell me, tell me, would you want me? (Want me)
Tell me, tell me, would you call me? (Call me)
If you knew I wasn't balling

Tell me, tell me, do you need me? (Need me)
Tell me, tell me, do you love me? (Yeah)
Or is you just tryna play me?
'Cause I need a gyal to hold me down for life

If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
