6 ContributorsWalking to New Orleans LyricsThis time, I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm goin' to need two pair of shoes
When I get through walkin' these blues
When I get back to New Orleans

I've got my suitcase in my hand
Now, ain't that a sham?
I'm leavin' here today
Yes, I'm goin' back home to stay
Yes, I'm walkin' to New Orleans

You used to be my honey
'Til you spent all my money
No use for you to cry
I'll see you, by and by
Cause I'm walkin' to New Orleans

I've got no time for talkin'
I've got to keep on walkin'
New Orleans is my home
That's the reason while I'm gone

Yes, I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm walkin' to New OrleansYou might also like1Embed
