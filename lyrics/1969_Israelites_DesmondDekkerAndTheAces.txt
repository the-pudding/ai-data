23 ContributorsIsraelites Lyrics[Verse 1]
Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor, poor me, Israelites (Ah-ah)
Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor, poor me, Israelites, sir

[Verse 2]
My wife and my kids, they pack up and a-leave me
Darling, she said, "I was yours to receive"
Poor, poor me, Israelites, hey
Shirt, them a-tear up, trousers are gone
I don't want to end up like Bonnie and—
(Poor) Bonnie and Clyde, poor me, Israelites, hey

[Verse 3]
After a storm, there must be a calm
They catch me in the farm
You sound your alarm
Poor, poor me, Israelites, hey
