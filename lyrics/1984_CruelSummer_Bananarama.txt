Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning, I sit around
Trying to smile, but the air is so heavy and dry

[Verse 2]
Strange voices are saying (What did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand

[Chorus 1]
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

[Verse 3]
The city is crowded, my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I got to get up and go

[Chorus 1]
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

[Bridge]
You're not the only one
You might also like[Chorus 2]
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus 3]
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone

[Bridge]
You're not the only one

[Chorus 2]
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

[Bridge]
You're not the only one
[Outro]
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer12Embed
