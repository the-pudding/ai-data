Popsicles, icicles
Baseball and fancy clothes
These are a few of the things he loves
He loves Levis and brown eyes
And wind blowin' through his hair
These are a part of the boy I love

[Bridge]
If you put them all together
Much to your surprise (Oh, tell me what)
You'll find a bit of heaven
Right before your eyes

[Verse 2]
Bright stars and guitars
And drive-ins on Friday night
These are a few of the things we love
May be silly but still he is
Just what I dream about
Yes, he's the boy that I love

[Bridge]
If you put them all together
Much to your surprise (Oh, tell me what)
You'll find a bit of heaven
Right before your eyes
You might also like[Verse 2]
Bright stars and guitars
And drive-ins on Friday night
These are a few of the things we love
May be silly but still he is
Just what I dream about
Yes, he's the boy that I love

[Outro]
Popsicles, icicles
Popsicles, icicles, hmmmEmbed
