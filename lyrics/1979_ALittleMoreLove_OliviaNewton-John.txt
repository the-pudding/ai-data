Night is dragging her feet
I wait alone in the heat
I know, know that you'll have your way
'Til you have to go home
No's a word I can't say

[Chorus]
'Cause it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?

[Verse 2]
Where, where did my innocence go?
How, how was a young girl to know?
I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes
In the warmth of your arms, in the web of your lies

[Chorus]
But it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right? Hey
You might also like[Chorus]
It gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right? Hey

[Chorus]
It gets me nowhere to tell you no
And It gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right? Hey

[Chorus]
It gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you goEmbed
