3 ContributorsLittle Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, little girl
You don't have to hide nothin' no more
You didn't do nothin' that hadn't been done before

[Verse 2]
Little girl thought she wouldn't get caught, you see
She thought she'd get away with goin' out on me, yeah

[Verse 3]
Other girls did it, you didn't think of nothin' new
You went out on me, so other girls did it too
Heh, girl

[Verse 4]
You can leave little girl, I don't want you around no more
If you come knockin', you won't get past my door
Yeah!

[Verse 5]
You got nothin' to hide, and everybody knows it's true
Too bad little girl, it's all over for you
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, hehYou might also likeEmbed
