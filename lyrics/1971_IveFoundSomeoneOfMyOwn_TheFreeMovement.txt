4 ContributorsIâ€™ve Found Someone Of My Own LyricsI got up this morning
While I was having my coffee
My woman came in, sat down by my side
With tears in her eyes
She said 'I've a confession to make.'
I said 'Woman, speak what's on your mind.'
She said 'I've found somebody new
To take your place.'
'I said don't feel so all alone
I've found someone of my own.'
'All those lonely nights
You left me all alone
My true love would call
And talk to me on the phone.'
I said 'Woman, if that's the way it's gotta be
Then darlin, don't you worry about me.'
She said ' I've found somebody new
To take your place.'
'I said don't feel so all alone
I've found someone of my own.'
I got up from the table
Reached down and wiped the tears
From her face
I put out my cigarette
Turned and walked away
She said 'I've found somebody new
To take your place.'
'I said don't feel so all alone
I've found someone of my own.'You might also likeEmbed
