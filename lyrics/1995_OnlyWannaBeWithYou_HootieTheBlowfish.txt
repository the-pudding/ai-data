32 ContributorsOnly Wanna Be With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry

[Refrain]
Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

[Verse 2]
You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I moan and pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

[Refrain]
Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan
Sittin' on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherit a million bucks
And when she died it came to me

[Refrain]
I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
I only wanna be with you

[Refrain]
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I wonder
If it will ever end
You get so mad at me
When I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy
Then you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah
The Dolphins make me cry
[Refrain]
But there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

[Outro]
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you9Embed
