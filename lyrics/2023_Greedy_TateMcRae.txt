(Woo)

[Verse 1]
He said, "Are you serious? I've tried, but I can't figure out
I've been next to you all night and still don't know what you're about
You keep ta- (Ta-ta-), talkin', but not much comin' out your mouth

[Chorus]
I would want myself
Baby, please believe me
I'll put you through hell
Just to know me, yeah, yeah
So sure of yourself

(No, it won't) End well

[Post-Chorus]

He said, "I'm just curious, is this for real or just an act?
Can't tell if you love or hate me, never met someone like that
Drive me so (So, so) crazy, did you know you got that effect?"
I said, "Lemme check, yeah"
[Chorus]
I would want myself
Baby, please believe me
I'll put you through hell
Just to know me, yeah, yeah
So sure of yourself

That shit won't end well
(No, it won't) End well
