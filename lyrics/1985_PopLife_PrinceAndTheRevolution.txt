What's the matter with your life?
Is the poverty bringing you down?
Is the mailman jerking you 'round?
Did he put your million dollar check in someone else's box?

[Verse 2]
Tell me, what's the matter with your world?
Was it a boy when you wanted a girl? (Boy when you wanted a girl)
Don't you know straight hair ain't got no curl? (No curl)
Life, it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop
Dig it

[Chorus]
Pop life, everybody needs a thrill
Pop life, we all got a space to fill
Pop life, everybody can't be on top
But life, it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop
Dig it

[Verse 3]
Tell me, what's that underneath your hair?
Is there anybody living there? (Anybody living there)
You can't get over, if you say you just don't care (Don't care)
Show me a boy who stays in school, and I'll show you a boy aware
Dig it
You might also like[Chorus]
Pop life, everybody needs a thrill
Pop life, we all got a space to fill
Pop life, everybody can't be on top
But life, it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop
Dig it
Uh

[Verse 4]
What you putting in your nose?
Is that where all your money goes? (Is that where your money goes?)
The river of addiction flows
You think it's hot, but there won't be no water when the fire blows
Dig it

[Chorus]
Pop life, everybody needs a thrill
Pop life, we all got a space to fill
Pop life, everybody wants to be on top
But life, it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop

[Interlude]
Throw the bum out!

[Outro]
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life, we all, we got a space to fill
Pop life, everybody can't be on top
But life, it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop4Embed
