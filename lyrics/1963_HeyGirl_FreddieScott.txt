Hey girl, I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go (Bye-bye baby)
And hey girl, I tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me is going to die (Bye-bye, baby)
If you say, "So long" (Bye-bye, baby)
If this is goodbye (Bye-bye, baby), Whoa, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, this can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you? (Bye-bye, baby)
Hey girl, now, don't put me on
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone? (Bye-bye, baby)
How will I live? (Bye-bye, baby)
How can I go on? (Bye-bye, baby)

[Bridge]
How can I go on? (Bye-bye, baby)
Woah, oh, oh

[Saxophone Solo]
(Bye-bye, baby)

[Verse 3]
Hey girl, now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground (Bye-bye, baby)
And baby (Bye-bye, baby)
Beg you to stay (Bye-bye, baby)
Don't go away (Bye-bye, baby)
Hey girl (Bye-bye, baby)

Don't go away (Bye-bye, baby)
Hey girl (Bye-bye, baby)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't, don't go away (Bye-bye, baby)
