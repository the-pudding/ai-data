11 ContributorsIf This Is It Lyrics[Guitar intro: Chris Hayes]

[Verse 1]
I've been phoning
A-Night and morning
I heard you say:
"Tell him I'm not home"

Now you're confessing
But I'm still guessing
I've been your fool
For so, so long

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Girl, don't lie
Just to save my feelings
Girl, don't cry
And tell me nothing's wrong

Girl don't try
To make up phony reasons
I'd rather leave
Than never believe

[Chorus 1]
If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love
You'd better let me go
You might also likeIf this is it
(Ooh-wap)
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so

[Verse 2]
You've been thinking
And I've been drinking
We both know that it's
Just not right

Now you're pretending
That it's not ending
You'll say anything
To avoid a fight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Girl, don't lie
And tell me that you need me
Girl, don't cry
And tell me nothing's wrong

I'll be all right
A-One way or another
So let me go
Or make me want to stay
[Chorus 2]
If this is it
Please let me know
(Ooh) If this ain't love

You'd better let me go

If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so

[Guitar solo: Chris Hayes]

[Chorus 3]
(Ooh-wap) If this is it
(Ooh-woah) Please let me know
(Ooh) If this ain't love
You'd better let me go

If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so

(If this is it
Please let me know)
I wanna know
(Ooh)
(If this is it)
If this is it
(Please let me know)
I gotta know
(Ooh)

You better let me know
