Eagle's calling and he's calling your name
Tides are turning, bringing winds of change
Why do I feel this way?
The promise of a new day

[Chorus]
The promise, the promise of a new day

[Verse 2]
As through time, the earth moves under my feet
One step closer to make love complete
What has the final say?
The promise of a new day

[Chorus]
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise

[Post-Chorus]
And so time over time, what will change the world?
No one knows (No one knows)
So the only promise is
A day to live, to give and share with one another
You might also like[Verse 3]
See the wisdom from mistakes in our past
Hear the younger generation ask
"Why do I feel this way?"
The promise of a new day

[Chorus]
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day (A new day)
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day (The promise)
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day (We can, we can make it better, baby)

[Post-Chorus]
So time over time, what will change the world?
No one knows (No one knows)
So the only promise is
A day to live, to give and share with one another

[Verse 4]
Eagle's calling and he's calling your name
Tides are turning, bringing winds of change
Why do I feel this way?
The promise of a new day
[Chorus]
The promise, the promise of a new day (A new day)

[Verse 5]
As through time, the earth moves under my feet
One step closer to make love complete
What has the final say?
The promise of a new day

[Chorus]
The promise, the promise of a new day (Don't promise me)
The promise, the promise of a new day (A new day)
The promise, the promise of a new day (A new day)
The promise, the promise of a new day

[Verse 3 Reprise]
See the wisdom from mistakes in our past
Hear the younger generation ask
What has the final say?
The promise of a new day

[Chorus]
The promise, the promise of a new day

[Verse 1 Reprise]
Eagle's calling and he's calling your name
Tides are turning, bringing winds of change
Why do I feel this way?
The promise of a new day
[Chorus]
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day (New day)
The promise, the promise of a new day (Why do I feel this way?)
The promise, the promise of a new day (Hey)

[Outro]
The promise, the promise of a new day (Eagle's calling and he's calling your name)
The promise, the promise of a new day (Tides are turning, bringing winds of change)
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day (As through time, the earth moves under my feet)
The promise, the promise of a new day (Ooh-ooh)
The promise, the promise of a new day (One step closer to make love complete)
The promise, the promise of a new dayEmbed
