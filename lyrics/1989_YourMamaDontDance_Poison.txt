Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening rolls around and it's time to hit the town
Where do you go? You gotta rock it

[Verse 1]
The old folks say that you gotta end your date by ten, mhm
But if you're out on a date, don't you bring her home late 'cause it's a sin
You know there's no excuse, you know you're gonna lose
You never win, I'll say it again and it's all because

[Chorus]
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around and it's time to hit the town
Where do you go? You gotta rock it, rock it

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pulled into a drive-in and found a place to park
We hopped into the back seat where it's always nice and dark
I'm just about to move, thinking "Hm, Bret, this is a breeze!"
There's a light in my eye and a guy says, "Outta the car, longhair!"
Ooh-wee, you're coming with me
Said the local police, and it's all because
You might also like[Chorus]
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
But when evening rolls around and it's time to hit the town
Where do you go? Ah, play me a little, C.C. 

[Guitar Solo]
Woo, yeah

[Outro]
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
You just stay cool and you ain't about to stop
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock
Your mama don't dance, no
She just don't dance, no
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and rollEmbed
