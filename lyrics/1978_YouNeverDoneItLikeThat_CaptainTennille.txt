4 ContributorsYou Never Done It Like That LyricsOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You're so terrific ooh
You never done it like that
You've never been this way before
To be specific ooh
You never done it like that
Who went and opened up the door
My lips are burnin' yeah
You never done it like that
I thought the flame was dead and gone
But you've been learnin' yeah
You never done it like that
How long has this been goin' on
Ooh who's been reachin' you
Show me the man and let me shake his hand
Hey look at me
I feel just like Columbus
I did discover you're some kind of lover

My mind is blowin' ooh
You never done it like that
You got me climbin' up the wall
My love is growin' yeah
You never done it like that
You know you make me ten feet tall
You might also likeOoh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
You never done it you never done it
You never done it like that
Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
You never done it you never done it
You never done it like that
Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
You never done it you never done it
You never done it like that
Oh what a feelin' ooh
You never done it like that
Not since I can remember when
I'm on the ceiling ooh
You never done it like that
Looks like we got it on again
