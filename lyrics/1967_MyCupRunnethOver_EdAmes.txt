3 ContributorsMy Cup Runneth Over Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes in the morning, when shadows are deep
I lie here beside you just watching you sleep
And sometimes I whisper what I'm thinking of
My cup runneth over with love

[Verse 2]
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see
I study the small things you do constantly
I memorize moments that I'm fondest of
My cup runneth over with love

[Verse 3]
In only a moment we both will be old
We won't even notice the world turning cold
And so, in this moment with sunlight above
My cup runneth over with love

[Outro]
My cup runneth over with love
With loveYou might also likeEmbed
