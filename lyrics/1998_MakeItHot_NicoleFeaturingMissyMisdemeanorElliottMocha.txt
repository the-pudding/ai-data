17 ContributorsMake It Hot Lyrics[Intro: Mocha]
But uh anyway
You could catch me any day
Sipping Hennessey
And my peeps get plenty way
But anyways, to see that I hold this dough
Cats fake it, I made it
I told you so
Mocha Latte, kid
We no play
Stress-free, sexy in Montego Bay
It's a pity that y'all look like idiots
Yo boo, let me know when I should rip this cat

[Verse 1: Nicole]
My man, he don't call me anymore
We don't even kiss
Am I his fool?
What must I do to keep him loving me?
All this love I give?
That ain't cool

[Chorus]
I got what you want (got what you want)
I got what you need (I got what you need)
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it hot
I got what you want (got what you want)
I got what you need (I got what you need)
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it hot

Call my man at the crib
He turned off his phone
Said to call him back
Why? Silly me
Why didn't I suspect he was making love
To someone else?
Boy, you killing me

[Chorus]
I got what you want (got what you want)
I got what you need (I got what you need)
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it hot
I got what you want (got what you want)
I got what you need (I got what you need)
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it hot

[Interlude]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
I got what you want
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it hot
I got what you want
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it hot
[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I'm sitting on the side of the curb
With a pocket of herb
I don't know if y'all heard I'm high as a bird
I can fly like Kelly, I glide like skates
Me with no Timbaland is like Puff with no Mase
Wait, hold up, wait a minute, what you say?
Back it up, give me space, who that? Nicole Wray
By the way, DJ, better play all day
Make the whole world say, "Damn, they sick of me!"

[Adlib: Missy Elliott]
Yo yo yo
Yeah this been kinda junk
That be making everybody wanna bop their heads
Haters, lovers, whatever
Nicole Wray, Timbaland, Mag-a-noo, Aaliyah
Ginuwine, Missy...ha-ha, Playa

[Chorus (with Timbaland)]
I got what you want
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it hot
I got what you want
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it hot3Embed
