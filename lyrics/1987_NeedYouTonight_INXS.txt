34 ContributorsNeed You Tonight Lyrics[Intro]
Come over here

[Verse 1]
All you got is this moment
Twenty-first century's yesterday
You can care all you want
Everybody does, yeah, that's okay

[Chorus]
So slide over here and give me a moment
Your moves are so raw, I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind
Ow

I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleepin'
There's something about you, girl
That makes me sweat

[Verse 2]
How do you feel? I'm lonely
What do you think? Can't think at all
What'cha gonna do? Gonna live my life
