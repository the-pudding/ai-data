[Verse 1]
You are all the woman I need
And baby, you know it
(Know it, know it, know it)
You can make this beggar a king
A clown or a poet
(Poet, poet, poet)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll give you all that I own
You got me standing in line
Out in the cold, pay me some mind

[Chorus]
Bend me, shape me, any way you want me
Long as you love me, it's all right
Bend me, shape me, any way you want me
You got the power to turn on the light

[Verse 2]
Everybody tells me I'm wrong
To want you so badly
(Badly, badly, badly)
But there's a force driving me on
I follow it gladly
(Gladly, gladly, gladly)

So let them laugh, I don't care
'Cause I got nothing to hide
All that I want is you by my side

[Chorus]
Bend me, shape me, any way you want me
Long as you love me, it's all right
Bend me, shape me, any way you want me
You got the power to turn on the light

[Chorus]
Yeah, bend me, shape me, any way you want me
Long as you love me, it's all right
Bend me, shape me, any way you want me
You got the power to turn on the light
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus/Outro]
Bend me, shape me, any way you want me
Long as you love me, it's all right
Bend me, shape me, any way you want me...1Embed
