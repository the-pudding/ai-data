(It's late)
We gotta get on home
It's late
(It's late)
We've been gone too long

Too bad
(Too bad)
We shoulda checked our time
Can't phone
(Can't phone)
We done spent every dime

It's late
(It's late)
We're 'bout to run outta gas
It's late
(It's late)
We gotta get home fast

Can't speed
(Can't speed)
We're in a slow-down zone
Baby, look at that clock
Why can't it be wrong?
