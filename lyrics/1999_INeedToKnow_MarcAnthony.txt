12 ContributorsI Need to Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
They say around the way you've asked for me
There's even talk about you wanting me
I must admit that's what I wanna hear
But that's just talk until you take me there

[Pre-Chorus]
If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know
Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go

[Chorus]
Because I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know
I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know

[Verse 2]
My every thought is of this being true
It's getting harder not to think of you
Girl, I'm exactly where I wanna be
The only thing's I need you here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know
Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go
