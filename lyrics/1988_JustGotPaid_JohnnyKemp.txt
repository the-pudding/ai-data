9 ContributorsJust Got Paid Lyrics[Intro Hook]
Just got paid; it's Friday night
Party hunting, feeling right
Body shaking, all around
Know one thing: I'm getting down

[Verse 1]
Check the mirror, I'm looking fly
Round up my posse, jump in my ride
Radio rocking a monster jam
Feel the rhythm, pump up the sound

[Pre-Hook 1]
Feeling so good
Don't you know I'm just grooving to the beat?
I'm grooving, grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Just got paid; it's Friday night
Party hunting, the bass is right
Booty shaking all around
Poured my drink, now I'm getting down

[Verse 2]
On the floor rocking to the beat
Oh-wee, you sure look sweet
Fine young lady, standing by
Come on, baby, sweet eye delight
You might also like[Pre-Hook 2]
I love the way that you move; you look so sweet
When you're moving to the beat
I'm tired of all these boring parties
Why don't we get on down?
Come on, let's get on down now

[Hook]

[Bridge 1]
Getting down
Say ho (You say it)
Say ho-ho (Ho-ho)
Say ho

[Pre-Hook 3]
On the floor rocking to the beat (Rocking, baby)
Oh-wee, you sure look sweet
Fine young lady standing by (Come here)
Come on, baby, look me in my eye

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
Getting down, yeah, getting down
Say ho (Ho-ho)
Say ho-ho (Ho-ho-ho)
Say ho
[Break]
Teddy, you play it

Shake it up, shake it up
I just got paid
I'm feeling, I'm feeling right

[Hook x2]

[Ad-libs]
Just got paid, it's Friday
[?] have a good time
Having a good time, baby
Having a good time, baby
I'm getting down
Getting down, getting down

[Outro]
I'm getting down down
I'm getting down down4Embed
