Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you do what your big sister done

[Verse 1]
Well, I dated your big sister
And I took her to a show
I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out the door

[Chorus]
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you do what your big sister done

[Verse 2]
Every time I see your sister
Well, she's got somebody new
She's mean and she's evil
Like that little ol' boll weevil
Guess I'll try my luck with you
You might also like[Chorus]
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you do what your big sister done

[Verse 3]
Well, I used to pull your pigtails
And pinch your turned-up nose
But you been a-growing
And baby, it's been showing
From your head down to your toes

[Chorus]
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you do what your big sister done

[Outro]
Little sister, don't you do what your big sister done
Little sister, don't you do what your big sister doneEmbed
