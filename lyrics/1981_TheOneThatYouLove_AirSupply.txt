8 ContributorsThe One That You Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now the night has gone
Now the night has gone away
Doesn't seem that long
We hardly had two words to say
Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

[Verse 2]
Don't say the morning's come
Don't say the morning's come so soon
Must we end this way
When so much here is hard to lose
Love is everywhere, I know it is
Such moments as this are too few
Oh, it's all up to you
It's all up to you

[Chorus]
Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Tell me we can stay
Tell me we can stay, oh please
They are the words to say
The only words I can believe
Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

[Chorus]
Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways
Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

[Bridge]
The night has gone, a part of yesterday
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways
Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways
[Outro]
Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many waysEmbed
