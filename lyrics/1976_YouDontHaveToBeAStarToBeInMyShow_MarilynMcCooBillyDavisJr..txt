You don't have to be a star

[Verse 1: Billy Davis Jr & Marylin McCoo]
Baby, come as you are
With just your heart
And I'll take you in
You're rejected and hurt
To me you're worth
What you have within
Now, I don't need no superstar
'Cause I'll accept you as you are
You won't be denied
'Cause I'm satisfied
With the love you inspire

[Chorus: Billy Davis Jr & Marylin McCoo]
You don't have to be a star, baby
To be in my show (To be in my show)
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show

[Verse 2: Billy Davis Jr & Marylin McCoo]
Somebody nobody knows
Could steal the tune
That you want to hear
So stop your running around
'Cause now you've found
What was cloudy is clear
Oh honey
There'll be no cheering from the crowd
Just two hearts beating out loud
There'll be no parades
No TV or stage
Only me till your dying day

You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my
My, my, my, my, my show

(You don't have to be a star)
(You don't have to be a star)
(You don't have to be a star)

[Verse 3: Billy Davis Jr & Marylin McCoo]
Don't think your star has to shine
For me to find out
Where you're coming from
What is a beauty queen
If it don't mean
I'm your number one?
Oh honey
And I don't need no superstar
'Cause I'll accept you as you are
You won't be denied
'Cause I'm satisfied
With the love you inspire

[Chorus: Billy Davis Jr & Marylin McCoo]
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my
My, my, my, my, my show
You don't have to be a star, baby
To be in my show
You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my
My, my, my, my1Embed
