18 ContributorsNever Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her, you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell, by the flames that burned your words?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never read your letter
'Cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try and make it all ok

[Chorus]
Does it hurt to know I'll never be there? (Does it hurt?)
Bet it sucks, see my face everywhere (Bet it sucks)
It was you, who chose to end it like you did (You chose)
(Ooh) I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do (You knew)
And don't say, you simply lost your way (What you would do)
She may believe you, but I never will
Never again

[Verse 2]
If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh, how cute
Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you
You'll die together, but alone

You wrote me in a letter
You couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer
Repent yourself away

[Chorus]
Does it hurt to know I'll never be there? (Does it hurt?)
Bet it sucks, see my face everywhere (Bet it sucks)
It was you, who chose to end it like you did (You chose)
(Ooh) I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do (You knew)
And don't say, you simply lost your way (What you would do)
They may believe you, but I never will
Never again

[Bridge]
Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never
Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never
[Chorus]
Does it hurt to know I'll never be there? (Does it hurt?)
Bet it sucks, see my face everywhere (Bet it sucks)
It was you, who chose to end it like you did (You chose)
(Ooh) I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do (You knew)
And don't say, you simply lost your way (What you would do)
They may believe you, but I never will

[Outro]
I never will
I never will
Never again2Embed
