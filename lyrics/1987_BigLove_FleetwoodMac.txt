Looking out for love
In the night so still
Oh, I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill

[Chorus]
Looking out for love
Big, big love

[Verse 2]
You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh, you begged me to keep you
In that house on the hill

[Chorus]
Looking out for love
Big, big love

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
You might also like[Bridge]
I wake up
Alone with it all
I wake up
But only to fall

[Chorus]
Looking out for love
Big, big love
Just looking out for love
Big, big love

[Outro]
