Prove your love
Got to prove your love
Ooh yeah

[Verse 1]
I heard all about what you can do
But I've got to know, is it true?
You're telling me to trust, what should I believe?
You promise so much, but talk is cheap

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me that you're serious
But I got to know for sure
You say how much you want me
But I've heard it all before

[Chorus]
Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talk to mine

[Verse 2]
Boy, I can feel a love is on the rise
A message revealed in your eyes
You know I can't wait to know your passion
It's not too late, so take some action
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Can you say that when you're through
I'll know what love is all about?
Well, baby, I've been patient
Now I'm ready to find out

[Chorus]
Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talk to mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me that you're serious
But I got to know for sure
You say how much you want me
But I've heard it all before

[Chorus]
Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body
Prove your love, got to prove your love (Ooh)
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talk to mine
Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body (Your body, yeah)
Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff 'cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talk to mineEmbed
