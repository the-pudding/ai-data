11 ContributorsStay Lyrics[Verse 1]
If this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go out alone
Don't think I'll understand

[Chorus]
(Stay) Stay with me
Stay with me

[Verse 2]
In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in-betweens
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more

[Chorus]
(Stay) Stay with me
Stay with me

[Verse 3]
You'd better hope and pray
That you make it safe back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray
That you wake one day in your own world
'Cause when you sleep at night
They don't hear your cries in your own world
Only time will tell
If you can break the spell back in your own world
You might also like[Chorus]
Ahh
(Stay) Stay with me
(Stay) Stay with me
(Stay) Stay, stay with me ahh-ha
(Stay) Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
(Stay) Stay with me2Embed
