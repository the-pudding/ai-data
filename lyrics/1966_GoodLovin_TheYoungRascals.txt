One, two, three!
Good lovin', good lovin'
Good lovin', good lovin'

[Verse 1]
I was feelin' so bad
I asked my family doctor just what I had
I said "Doctor (Doctor), Mr. M.D. (Doctor)
Now can you tell me what's ailin' me?" (Doctor)

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Yes indeed, all I, I really need

[Chorus]
Good lovin', now gimme that good, good lovin'
Good lovin', all I need is lovin'
Good lovin', good, good lovin', baby
Good lovin'

[Verse 2]
Honey, please squeeze me tight (squeeze me tight)
Don't you want your baby to be all right? (be all right)
I said baby (baby), "Now it's for sure (it's for sure)
I got the fever, yeah, and you got the cure"
