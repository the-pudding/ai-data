My baby, he don't talk sweet
He ain't got much to say
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
I know that he loves me anyway
And maybe he don't dress fine
But I don't really mind

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer

[Chorus]
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving one-man show
Wooah, wooah, wooah-oh
Let's hear it for the boy

[Verse 2]
My baby may not be rich
He's watching every dime
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
We always have a real good time
And maybe he sings off-key
But that's all right by me, yeah
'Cause what he does, he does so well
Makes me wanna yell
You might also like[Chorus]
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving one-man show
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Let's hear it for the boy

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer

[Chorus]
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving one-man show
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Let's hear it for the boy
