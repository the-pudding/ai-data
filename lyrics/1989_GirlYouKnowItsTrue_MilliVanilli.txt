26 ContributorsGirl You Know It’s True Lyrics[Intro: Fab Morvan]
So what are you doing back?
Well, I sat back and thought about the things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me
You mean a lot to me
I really mean that much to you?
Girl, you know it's true

[Verse 1: Charles Shaw]
I'm in love with you, girl, cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl? This love is true
You’re soft, silky hand long, sweet and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together, we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
Cause you contain a quality that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand

[Pre-Chorus: Charles Shaw]
I'm in love, girl
I'm in so love, girl
I'm just in love, girl
And this is true
You might also like[Chorus Brad Howell]
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you

[Refrain: Brad Howell]
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

[Verse 2: Charles Shaw]
This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotion starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet sweet voice would ring in my ear
It stimulate my senses, girl, when you are near
Come with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin
That's for me to bust it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearing I don't care, as I've said before
No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
[Pre-Chorus: Charles Shaw]
I'm in love, girl
I'm in so love, girl
I'm just in love, girl
And this is true

[Chorus Brad Howell]
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you

[Refrain: Brad Howell]
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

[Breakdown: Charles Shaw]
I'm in love wit' you, girl
I'm in love wit' you, girl, girl, girl, girl
I'm in love wit' you, I'm in love wit' you
I'm in love wit' you

[Refrain: Brad Howell]
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
[Chorus Brad Howell]
Girl, you know it's true (G-g-g-girl)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true (G-g-g-g-girl)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you4Embed
