77 ContributorsUse Somebody Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

[Chorus]
Someone like you

[Verse 2]
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

[Chorus]
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
Somebody

[Bridge]
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
