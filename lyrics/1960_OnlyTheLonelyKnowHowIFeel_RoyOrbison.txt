1 ContributorWings For Wheels LyricsThe screen door slams, christine's (angelina's) dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy orbison singing for the lonely
(hey) that's me (babe) and I want you only
Don't turn me home again
I just can't face myself alone (in that mirror) again tonight
Don't run back inside, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking
That maybe you (we) ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith (well woman) there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but hey (baby, ah) you're alright
And that's alright with me

This 4/4 she's gonna overheat
Make up your mind girl I gotta get her back out on the street
I know you're lonely like me so baby don't try and fake it
I'm no prince and I can't lay the stars at your feet
But I got this old car and she's pretty tough to beat
There's plenty of room in my front seat, baby if you wanna take it

Oh roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
It's like the rushing touch, the dirty wings them highway angels wear
Well tonight we're gonna find out how it feels
I'm gonna trade in your wings - for wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks
Ah, mama, come take my hand (well now try hard chrissie to understand)
We're gonna ride all the way to the promised land
Oh I'm gonna dance all the way, dance all the way
(babe if you're born with nothing in your hands
Hey it's your only chance)

There's something waiting for us, down that dirty road
Oh take a chance, take a chance, take a chance
(oh I wish you would come
So leave what you've lost, leave what's grown old on thunder road)

Well now I bought this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
I got my car parked out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
Well I think we could take it all babe, just you and me
Climb in back baby, the ride's for free
Oh come take my hand, we're gonna ride all the way to the promised land
We'll dance all the way
Oh baby I don't know but I've been told
There's something waiting for us, down that dirty road
If we take our chance, take our chance

Now the season's over and I feel it getting cold
I wish I could take you to some sandy beach where we'd never grow old
Ah but baby you know that's just jive
But tonight's bustin' open and I'm alive
Oh do (baby) whay you can to make me feel like a man
But this 4/4/2's gonna overheat
Make up your mind girl, I gotta get her back out on the street
I know you're lonely like me, oh so don't fake it
And maybe I can't lay the stars at your feet
But I got this old car and she's pretty tough to beat
There's plenty of room in my front seat
Oh if you think you can make it, climb in (so christine climb in)
This is town full of losers and baby I was born to winEmbed
