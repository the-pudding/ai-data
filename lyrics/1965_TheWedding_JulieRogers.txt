3 ContributorsThe Wedding (La Novia) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You by my side that's how I see us
I close my eyes, and I can see us
We're on our way to say, "I do"
My secret dreams have all come true

[Chorus]
I see the church, I see the people
Your folks and mine happy but smiling
And I can hear sweet voices singing
Ave Maria

[Verse 2]
Oh, my love, my love, this can really be
That some day you'll walk down the aisle with me?
Let it be, make it be that I'm the one for you
I'll be yours, all yours, now and forever

[Chorus]
I see us now your hand in my hand
This is the hour, this is the moment
And I can hear sweet voices singing
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
