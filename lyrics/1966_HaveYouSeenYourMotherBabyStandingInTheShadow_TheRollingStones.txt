[Chorus]
Have you seen your mother, baby
Standing in the shadow?
Have you had another, baby
Standing in the shadow?

[Verse 1]
I'm glad I opened your eyes
The have-nots would've tried
To freeze you in ice

[Chorus]
Have you seen your brother, baby
Standing in the shadow?
Have you had another, baby
Standing in the shadow?

[Verse 2]
Well, I was just passing the time
I'm all alone, won't you give
All your sympathy to mine?

[Bridge]
Tell me a story about how you adore me
Live in the shadow, see through the shadow
Glimpse through the shadow, tear at the shadow
Hate the shadow, love in the shadow life
(Well, I said have)

Have you seen your lover, baby
Standing in the shadow?
Has he had another, baby
Standing in the shadow?

[Verse 3]
Just where have you been all your life?
Talking about all the people
Who would try anything twice, oh

[Chorus]
Have you seen your mother, baby
Standing in the shadow?
Has she had another, baby
Standing in the shadow?

[Verse 4]
Well, you take your choice at the time
The brave old world or the slide
To the depths of decline? Oh, decline
