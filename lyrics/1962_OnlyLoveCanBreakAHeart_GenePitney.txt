Only love can mend it again

Last night I hurt you
But darlin', remember this
Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again, mmm

You know I'm sorry
I'll prove it with just one kiss
Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

Give me a chance to
Make up for the harm I've done
Try to forgive me
And let's keep the two of us one

Please let me hold you
And love you for always and always
Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it againYou might also likeEmbed
