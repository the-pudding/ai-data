[Verse 1]
It's the time of the season
When the love runs high
In this time, give it to me easy
And let me try with pleasured hands

[Chorus]
To take you in the sun to (Promised lands)
To show you every one
It's the time of the season for loving
[Verse 2]
What's your name? (What's your name?)
Who's your daddy? (Who's your daddy?)
(He rich?) Is he rich like me?
Has he taken (Has he taken)
Any time (Any time)
(To show) To show you what you need to live?

[Chorus]
Tell it to me slowly (Tell you what?)
I really want to know
It's the time of the season for loving
