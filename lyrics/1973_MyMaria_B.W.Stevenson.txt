My Maria
Don't you know I have come a long, long way?
I've been longin' to see her, when she's around, she takes my blues away

[Verse 2]
Sweet Maria
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies

[Chorus]
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl, oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl), I love you

[Verse 3]
My Maria
There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my peace of mind

[Verse 4]
Gypsy lady
You're a miracle worker for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailin' on the sea

[Bridge]
She is the sunlight when the skies are grey
She treat me so right, lady, take me away
You might also like[Chorus]
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl, oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl), I love you

[Chorus]
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl, oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl), I love you1Embed
