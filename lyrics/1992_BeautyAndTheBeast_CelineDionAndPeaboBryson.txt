27 ContributorsBeauty and the Beast Lyrics[Intro: Céline Dion]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Céline Dion]
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

[Verse 2: Peabo Bryson, Céline Dion & Peabo Bryson]
Just a little change
Small, to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast

[Bridge: Céline Dion & Peabo Bryson]
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

[Interlude: Peabo Bryson, Céline Dion]
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh

Ever just the same (Yeah)
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise  (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 3: Céline Dion, Peabo Bryson, Céline Dion & Peabo Bryson]
Tale as old as time (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

[Verse 4: Peabo Bryson, Céline Dion, Céline Dion & Peabo Bryson]
Certain as the sun (Certain as the sun)
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast

[Outro: Peabo Bryson, Céline Dion, Céline Dion & Peabo Bryson]
Oh
Oh, whoa-oh
Ooh
Beauty and the beast5Embed
