Ayy

[Verse 1: T.I. & Beyoncé]
(I want a soldier) The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' them Impalas around
(I got a soldier) With the top down, feelin' the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs, ridin' harder than guys
With the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them flames spittin' at you, tell 'em, "Don't even try it"
Shoot it with 'Chelle and kick it with Kelly or holla at B
Ya gotta be Gs, you way outta your league, please

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
We like them boys that be in them 'lacs leanin' (Leanin')
Open their mouth, their grill gleamin' (Gleamin')
Candy paint, keep that wheel clean and (Clean and)
They always be talkin' that country slang we like
They keep that beat that be in the back beatin' (Beatin')
Eyes be so low from that chiefin' (Chiefin')
I love how he keep my body screamin' (Screamin')
A rude boy that's good to me with street credibility

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

We like them boys up top from the B.K. (B.K.)
Know how to flip that money three ways (Three ways)
Always ridin' big on the freeway (Freeway)
With that East Coast slang that us country girls, we like
Low-cut Caesar's with the deep waves (Deep waves)
So quick to snatch up your Beyoncé (Your Beyoncé)
Always comin' down, boppin' our way (Our way)
Tellin' us that country girls the kind of girls they like

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
If his status ain't hood (Ain't hood), I ain't checkin' for him

[Refrain: Beyoncé & Destiny's Child]
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at? Where they at?)
They wanna take care of me (Where they at?)

Don't mind takin' one for me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at? Where they at?)
They wanna spend that on me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at? Where they at?)

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Next to the speakers, keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
A reformed D-boy, used to run into traps
Still a soldier, go to war if you runnin' your trap
About my girls, ain't no thing to put ya under the map (Come on)
Walk the streets, five-deep with nothin' less than a stack
And eighty carats on my chest provides a special attraction
Fifty Gs in my jeans, plus the dough from the white
It's a reason I'm the king, girl, I know what you like, come on

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood (Ain't hood), I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

[Verse 5: Michelle Williams, Michelle Williams & Beyoncé]
I like them boys over there, they lookin' strong tonight (Strong tonight)
Just might give one the phone tonight (Phone tonight)
Homie in the dickies in my zone tonight (Zone tonight)
He don't know it might be on tonight
Oh, he lookin' good and he talkin' right (Talkin' right)
He the type that might change my life (Change my life)
Every time he look at me, my girls be like (Girls be like)
"That one may be the one tonight"
[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood (Ain't hood), I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Ayy, see, Cash Money is a army
I'm walkin' with purple hearts on me, you talkin' to the sergeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem, call them
Weezy F. Baby, please say the "baby"
If you don't see me on the block, I ain't tryna hide
I blend in with the hood, I'm camouflaged
Bandanna tied so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name, she salute

[Refrain: Beyoncé & Destiny's Child]
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at? Where they at?)
They wanna take care of me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at? Where they at?)
Don't mind takin' one for me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at? Where they at?)
They wanna spend that on me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at? Where they at?)
Wouldn't mind puttin' that on me (Where they at?)15Embed
