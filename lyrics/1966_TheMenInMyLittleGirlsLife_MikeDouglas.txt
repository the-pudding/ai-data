2 ContributorsThe Men In My Little Girlâ€™s Life LyricsRefrain:
The men in my little girl's life;
The men in my little girl's life

Seems only yesterday, I heard my daughter say:
"Daddy! There's a boy outside - his name is Rod
He wants to play in our back yard
Can he Daddy? Can he Daddy? Please - Daddy."

There wasn't so long ago
She came to me and she wanted to know:
"Daddy! There's a boy outside - his name is Lee
He wants to carry my books for me
Can he Daddy? Is it all right - Daddy?
He's got freckles, Dad."

Refrain:

Then came pony tails and jeans
My little girl was in her teens:
"Papa! There's a boy outside - his name's Tom
He wants to take me to the prom. Ok Papa?
He's cute Papa! We'll be home early - Papa."

Well, before I knew it, time had gone
My, how my little girl had grown: Then it was:
"Uh! Father! There's a boy outside - his name is Eddie
He wants to know if we can go steady?
Can we Father? Yes Father?
Oh! can we borrow the car Pop?"
You might also likeYes, it seems like only yesterday
I heard my lovely daughter say:
"Dad! There's a boy outside - his name is Jim
He asked me if I'd marry him?
I said yes, Dad! - Got something in your eye - Dad?
I love him Dad."

Refrain:

A child, an adolescent, a young lady, a wife
Oh! and oh yes, Heh! Heh!
There's another man in my little girl's life
"Hi Dad! There's a boy outside - his name is Tim
I told him Grandpa was gonna baby sit with him
Thanks Dad. Bless you Dad. Goodnight Dad."
