28 ContributorsAll Right Now Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, woah, woah
Ow

[Verse 1]
There she stood in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said, "Hey, what is this, now baby", maybe
Maybe she's in need of a kiss
I said, "Hey, what's your name baby?
Maybe we can see things the same"
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate
Ow!

[Chorus]
All right now, baby, it's all right now
All right now, baby, it's all right now

[Interlude]
Let me tell you now

[Verse 2]
I took her home to my place
Watchin' every move on her face
She said, "Look, what's your game, baby?
Are you tryin' to put me in shame?"
I said, "Slow, don't go so fast
Don't you think that love can last?"
She said, "Love, Lord above
Now you're tryin' to trick me in love"

Took her home yeah, to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said, "Look, what's your game?
Are you trying to put me in shame?"
"Baby," I said, "Slow, slow, don't go so fast
