1 ContributorHold What Youâ€™ve Got Lyrics[Intro]
You had better hold on
Hold on to what you got, woo Lord, yeah
You had better hold on
Hold on to what you got, yeah Lord

[Chorus]
'Cause if, woo, you think nobody wants it
Throw it away, yeah, and you will see
Someone will have it
Before you can count
One, two, three
Yeah they will, ooh Lord, yeah they will
Yeah they will

[Verse 1]
You know, I get letters all the time from people all over the country
Want me to help 'em straighten out their love affair
Like this letter I got from this lady down in Pahokee, Florida
Not too long ago
She wrote to me, she says "Dear Mr. T"
She said "I can't give you my name it's 'cause
I-it's too many peoples that know me"
She said "But I got this problem
'Cause I'm married to a good-lookin' man, don't you see
And everytime we go to night clubs
Women is always pullin' and huggin' and pinchin' on my mind"
She said "Now I'm tired of this mess
And I want you to help me straighten it out"
She said "I can't even get up to go to the restroom
Without comin' back, findin' women hangin' on my man"
I said "Miss lady"
I wrote and told her, I said "Miss lady
Anytime you married to a good-lookin' man like you've got
You will have women messin' with him all the time
So the best advice I can give to you
Is to stay out that ladies room as much as you can
Don't drink so much beer", heh
"'Cause beer'll have you runnin' in everytime you look around
And another thing, if you just got to go to the restroom", ha-ha-ha-ha
"You better take your man in there with you
'Cause let me tell you one thing", hoo
You might also like[Chorus]
Woo, you think, know it a-one morning
Throw him away, yeah, and you will see
Someone will have your man
Before you can count one, two, three
Yeah they will, ooh Lord
Yeah they will, yeah
Yeah they will, listen

[Verse 2]
I remember another letter that I got about a month ago
From a man down in New Orleans, Louisiana
He wrote me, he said "Dear Mr. T"
He said "My name is Grady Thompson", heh
"And I lives in New Orleans, Louisiana"
He said "I got this woman that I've been livin' wit
Goin' on forty-two years"
He said "But we just ain't got nothin' in common no more
We ain't made love in about three years"
I wrote him back and I said "Grady, oh Grady"
I said "Your problem is, is that you have got common
Common with the woman
You see, anytime that two people live together
And snore each other's face for ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years
It's easy to take each other for granted
And you can make so much love in the course of them years
Or until it gets like old dry hamburger to you sometime
With no lettuce and tomato on it", ha-ha!
"But let me tell you one thing
Just because it's like old dry hamburger to you
Remember, 'til somebody add the lemon
It's like a T-bone steak, yeah it is"
[Chorus]
Woo, and you think, know what the man wanted, ooh Lord
Pitch it in the streets, and you will see, yeah
Someone will have it before you can count
One, two, three
Yeah they will, let me tell you one thing

[Post-Chorus]
You better hold on, hold on
They got people that were made for it, oh Lord, ah
They got people that were made for it, well, well-well
You just throw it down, they'll have it 'fore it hits the ground, Lord
Hold on, ow, hold on
Go on, hold on, hold on
I don't care what shape it's in, hold on
You see, they got somethin' in the drug store to straighten it all out
Heh-heh-heh-heh!
And if the drug store can't do it, y'all go see Mother May
She'll give you some roots for it, hold on
We need to hold onEmbed
