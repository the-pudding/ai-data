18 ContributorsCherish Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand, you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
For time is passing by

I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night?

[Chorus]
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (oh)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

[Verse 2]
The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side

I often pray before I lay down by your side
And if you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night?

[Chorus]
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (Baby, yeah)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
