Here they come again (Mmm-mm-mm)
Catch us if you can (Mmm-mm-mm)
Time to get a move on (Mmm-mm-mm)
We will yell with all of our might

[Chorus]
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can

[Verse 2]
Now, we gotta run (Mmm-mm-mm)
No more time for fun (Mmm-mm-mm)
When we're gettin' angry (Mmm-mm-mm)
We will yell with all of our might

[Chorus]
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can
