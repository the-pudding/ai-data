We walked the loneliest mile
We smiled without any style
We kiss altogether wrong
No intention
We lied about each other's drinks
We lived without each other thinking
What anyone would do
Without me and you

[Chorus]
It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play

[Verse 2]
So hold on, here we go
Hold on to nothin' we know
I feel so lonely way up here
You mention the time we were together
So long ago, well I don't remember
All I know is that it makes me feel good now

[Chorus]
It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play

[Chorus]
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play
It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play
