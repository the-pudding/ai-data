11 ContributorsHands Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I could tell the world just one thing it would be
That we're all okay
And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful and useless in times like these
I won't be made useless
I won't be idle with despair
I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

[Chorus]
My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken
[Verse 2]
Poverty stole your golden shoes
It didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But I knew it wasn't ever after
We'll fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

[Chorus]
My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken

In the end, only kindness matters
In the end, only kindness matters

[Bridge]
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray

[Chorus]
My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken
My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken
We are never broken

[Outro]
We are God's eyes
God's hands
God's heart
We are God's eyes
God's hands
God's heart
We are God's eyes
We are God's hands
We are God's eyesEmbed
