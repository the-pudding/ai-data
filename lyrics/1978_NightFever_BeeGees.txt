26 ContributorsNight Fever Lyrics[Verse 1]
Listen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it
On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's somethin' we can share
We can steal it

[Pre-Chorus]
And that sweet city woman, she moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right

[Chorus]
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Verse 3]
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind, makin' it mine
You might also like[Chorus]
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Verse 4]
In the heat of our love, don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin'
I got fire in my mind, I get higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowin' in the dark, I give you warnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And that sweet city woman, she moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right

[Chorus]
I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Verse 3]
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind, makin' it mine
[Chorus]
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Outro]
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it7Embed
