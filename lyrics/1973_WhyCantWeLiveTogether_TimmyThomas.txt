17 ContributorsWhy Canâ€™t We Live Together Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me why? Tell me why? Tell me why?
Mmm, why can't we live together?
Tell me why? Tell me why?
Mmm, why can't we live together?

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we live together?

[Verse 2]
No more wars, no more wars, no more war
Mmm, just a little peace in this world
No more wars, no more war
All we want is some peace in this world

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we live together?

[Bridge]
Can't live, can't live
Can't live together
Can't live together

[Verse 3]
No matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother
I said, no matter, no matter what color
Mmm, you are still my brother
You might also like[Chorus]
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we live together?4Embed
