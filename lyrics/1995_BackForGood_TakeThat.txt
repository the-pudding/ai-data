23 ContributorsBack for Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

[Chorus]
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

[Verse 2]
Unaware but underlined I figured out this story (No, no)
It wasn't good (No, no)
But in the corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find
(Can't you find)
A little room inside for me
See Take That LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like[Chorus]
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

[Bridge]
And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

[Chorus]
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

[Outro]
I guess now it's time, that you came back for good4Embed
