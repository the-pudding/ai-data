We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up, everybody, and sing
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up, everybody, and sing

[Verse 1]
Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
(And) And we flock just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie
(All) All of the people around us, they say
"Can they be that close?"
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

Get up, everybody, and sing (Sing it to me)
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up, everybody, and sing
