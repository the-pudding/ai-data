The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops falling down a mountainside
Many times I've been here
Many times I've cried
We used to be so happy
When we were in love
High on a mountain of love

Night after night I've been standing here alone (On a mountain)
Weeping my heart out to cold gray dawn (Oh, yeah)
Praying that you're lonely and you'll come here too (Uh, huh)
Hoping just by chance that I get a glimpse of you
Trying hard to find you
Somewhere I love
High on a mountain of love

A mountain of love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
A mountain of love
You should be ashamed (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We used to be a mountain of love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you just changed your name (Ah, ah, ah)

Way down below there's a half a million people (In the valley)
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple (Oh, yeah)
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers (Uh, huh)
Wedding bells are ringing and they should have been ours
That's why I'm so lonely (Ah, ah, ah)
My dreams gone above
High on a mountain of love

A mountain of love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
A mountain of love
You should be ashamed (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We used to be a mountain of love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you just changed your name (Ah, ah, ah)

Way down below there's a half a million people (In the valley)
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple (Oh, yeah)
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers (Uh, huh)
Wedding bells are ringing and they should have been ours
That's why I'm so lonely (Ah, ah, ah)
My dreams gone above
High on a mountain of love

High on a mountain of love
High on a mountain of love
High on a mountain of loveEmbed
