15 ContributorsChange the World Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth

That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams

[Chorus]
And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world

[Verse 2]
If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way

And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day

I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world

[Chorus]
I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world3Embed
