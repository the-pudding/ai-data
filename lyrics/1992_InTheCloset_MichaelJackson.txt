56 ContributorsIn the Closet Lyrics[Intro]
There's something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

[Verse 1]
She's just a lover who's doin' me by
It's worth the givin', it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it
She wants to give it

[Chorus]
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (She wants to give it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Ah, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it

[Verse 2]
It's just a feelin', you have to soothe it
You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then if you want it, then won't you taste it?
She wants to give it
You might also like[Chorus]
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (She wanna get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Ah, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it

[Interlude]
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets, make your move, set me free

[Refrain]
Oh, because there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's somethin' about you, baby (Oh)

[Interlude]
Just promise me whatever we say or whatever we do to each other
For now, we'll make a vow to just keep it in the closet

[Verse 3]
If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's achin', you have to rub it
She wants to give it
[Chorus]
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (Get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Ah, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it

[Post-Chorus]
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell
Oh, because there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say or do to each other (Whatever we do)
We'll make a vow forever that we'll just keep it in the closet

[Refrain]
Because there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want
[Interlude]
Just promise me whatever we say or whatever we do to each other (Baby, whatever we do)
For now, we'll make a vow to just keep it in the closet

[Chorus]
She wants to give it (Dare me)
Keep it in the closet
She wants to give it (Dare me)
Keep it in the closet
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (Break it down)
She wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it
She wants to give it (Keep it in the closet)
She wants to give it (Ah)
She wants to give it (Ah, better keep it in the closet)
She wants to give it
Ah, she wants to give it (Dare me)11Embed
