3 ContributorsTower of Strength Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I were a tower of strength, I'd walk away
I'd look in your eyes and here's what I'd say
I don't want you, I don't need you
I don't love you anymore
And I'd walk out that door

[Chorus]
And you'd be down on your knees
And you'd be calling to me-ee
But a tower of a-strength is a-something
I'll never be

[Verse 2]
If I were a tower of strength, I'd watch you cry
I'd laugh at your tears and tell you goodbye
I don't want you, I don't need you
I don't love you anymore
And I'd walk out that door

[Chorus]
And you'd be down on your knees
And you'd be calling to me-ee
But a tower of a-strength is a-something
I'll never be

I don't want you, I don't a-need you
I don't love you any more
And I'd walk out that door

[Chorus]
And you'd be down on your knees, ahh-huh
You'd be calling to me-ee-ee
But a tower of a-strength is a-something
I'll never beEmbed
