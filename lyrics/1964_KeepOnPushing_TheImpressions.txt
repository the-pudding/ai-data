Keep on pushing
Keep on pushing

[Verse 1]
I've got to keep on pushing (Mhm), I can't stop now
Move up a little higher, some way, somehow
'Cause I've got my strength
And it don't make sense
Not to keep on pushin'

[Chorus]
Hey, hallelujah
Hallelujah
Keep on pushin'

[Verse 2]
Now maybe some day (Mhm), I'll reach that higher goal
I know I can make it with just a little bit of soul
'Cause I've got my strength
And it don't make sense
Not to keep on pushin'

[Verse 3]
Now look-a look (Look-a look), a-look-a yonder, what's that I see?
A great big stone wall stands there ahead of me
But I've got my pride
And I'll move on aside
And keep on pushin'
You might also like[Chorus]
Hey, hallelujah
Hallelujah
Keep on pushin'
Keep on pushin'
What I say now? Keep on pushin'
Well, it's alright, keep on pushin'Embed
