6 Contributors(There’s) No Gettin’ Over Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there ain't no getting over me

[Verse 2]
Well, you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me

[Bridge]
I'll be the bill you forgot to pay
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
I'll be the reason that you tell the boys no
Don't you know...

[Verse 3]
You can tell everyone that we're through
And you might even believe it too
But darling, there ain't no getting over me
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I'll be the face that you see in the crowd
I'll be the times that you cry out loud
I'll be the smile when there's no one around
I'll be the book that you just can't put down
You might also like[Verse 4]
So you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there ain't no getting over me
You'll see, sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me

[Outro]
No, no, no, no
No darling, there ain't no getting over me
Ooooh mmmm
Mmmm, no darling, there ain't no getting over me
Ooooh darling, there ain't no getting over me...1Embed
