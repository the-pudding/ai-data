Baby
Baby
You did something to me

[Verse 1]
I couldn't sleep at all last night
Just a-thinkin' of you
Baby, things weren't right

[Chorus]
Well, I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'
Tossin' and turnin' all night

[Verse 2]
I kicked the blankets on the floor
Turned my pillow upside down
I never, never did before

[Chorus]
Because I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'
Tossin' and turnin' all night

[Bridge]
Jumped out of bed
Turned on the light
I pulled down the shade
Went to the kitchen for a bite
Rolled up the shade
Turned off the light
I jumped back into bed
It was the middle of the night
You might also like[Verse 3]
The clock downstairs was strikin' four
Couldn't get you off my mind
I heard the milkman at the door

[Chorus]
'Cause I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'
Tossin' and turnin' all night

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Jumped out of bed
Turned on the light
I pulled down the shade
Went to the kitchen for a bite
Rolled up the shade
Turned off the light
I jumped back into bed
It was the middle of the night

[Verse 3]
The clock downstairs was strikin' four
I couldn't get you off my mind
I heard the milkman at the door
[Outro]
'Cause I was tossin' and turnin', hey-hey-hey-hey
I was turnin' and tossin' all day-day-day
I was tossin', hey-hey-hey and turnin' and tossin'
Tossin' and turnin' all babe-babe-babe1Embed
