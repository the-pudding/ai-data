14 ContributorsLovergirl Lyrics[Intro]
Hee...

Shoop-de-bop
Funky pops

[Verse 1]
Coffee, tea or me, baby, touché au lait
My opening line might be a bit passé, yes
But don't think that I don't know what I'm feeling for you
'Cause I got a vibe on you the first time that I saw you, saw you

[Pre-Chorus]
I need your love and I won't bring no pain
A little birdie told me that you feel the same
I'm for the real and for you I'm true blue
Let's make a deal, sugar, all I wanna do is be your one and only lover

[Chorus]
I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Hook, line and sinker baby, that's how you caught me
My second verse might be a bit old hat
But don't think that I don't know what it's doing to me
'Cause I got a vibe on you the first time you saw through me, through me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I need your love and I won't bring no pain
A little birdie told me that you feel the same
I'm for the real and for you I'm true blue
Let's make a deal, sugar, all I wanna do is be your one and only lover

[Chorus]
I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Hey, hey, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Baby, let me groove you
Let me groove into your love
I just want to be your lovergirl
Let me prove it to you
Baby, let me rock your world
I just want to rock your world
Coffee, tea or me, baby, touché au lait
My opening line might be a bit passé
But don't think that I don't know what I'm feeling for you
'Cause I got a vibe on you the first time that I saw you, whoa-oh
[Outro]
When the push comes to shove
And you need a little love
Let me put some rock into your world
Call me up, don't be shy
For my love will make you high
I just wanna be your lovergirl1Embed
