[Verse 1: Kaine]
Shawty crunk, so fresh, so clean
Can she fuck? That question been harassing me
In the mind, this bitch is fine
I done came to the club 'bout 50-11 times
Now can I play with your panty line?
The club owner said I need to calm down
Security guard's gonna sweat me now
Nigga drunker than a motherfucker, threaten me now

[Verse 2: D-Roc]
She getting crunk in the club, I mean she work it
And then I like to see the females twerking
Taking her clothes off, buckey naked
ATL, ho, don't disrespect it
A-pop your pussy like this
Cause Yin Yang Twins in this b-i-itch
Lil Jon and the East Side Boys with me
And we all like to see ass and titties
Now bring your ass over here, ho
And let me see you get low if you want this thug
Now take it to the floor (To the floor)
And if your ass wanna act, you can keep your ass where you're at

[Verse 4: Lil' Bo]
Now give me my dub back, go and get your friend
Stupid bitch standing there while I'm drinking my Henn'
Steady looking at me, still asking questions
Time's up, nigga, pass me another contestant
Ho, move to the left if you ain't 'bout 50
Done talked through 3 or 4 songs already
Looking at a nigga with your palm out
Bitch, I ain't even seen you dance

[Verse 5: D-Roc]
Twerk something, baby, work something, baby
Pop your pussy on the pole, do your thang, baby
Slide down that bitch a little bit, then stop
Get back on the floor, catch your balance, then drop
Now bring it back up, clap your ass like hands
I just wanna see your ass dirty dance
Yin Yang, we done done again
And put it on the map like "Hahn!"

Yeah, y'all twerkin' a little bit, ladies
But you gotta twerk a little bit harder than that
Now right now, I need all the ladies
That know they look good tonight
We want y'all to do this shit like this

Bounce that ass up and down and get (Get low, get low)
