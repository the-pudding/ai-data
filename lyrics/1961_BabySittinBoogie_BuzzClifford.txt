2 ContributorsBaby Sittinâ€™ Boogie Lyrics(gggggggggggggggg da da da-da-da-da!)
My girl baby sister saw it on her block
Then I come up to join her and we start to rock
The baby hears the beat and man it is a shock
When he goes (ggggggggggggg ggggggg)

A rockin type a boogie is the kind a song
That makes this little baby wanna sing along
And though he maybe gets the tune alittle wrong
He still goes (boogie-on-na-day)

He isn't too young to really feel the beat
He rocks back and forth in his little seat
He claps both his hands and he taps his feet
And he sings (doo-doo-da-da-da-da-da)

He is a hully-gully-bouncin-baby-boy
You know the record player is his favorite toy
And dont forget hes eveybodys pride and joy
When he goes (ooo-ah-ge-he)

(Yo-a-ah-ah)

(Ladaladalada)

I know there isnt anyone to take a bet
But surely hes the youngest teenager yet
And probably the hippest of the diaper set
Cause he goes (go man, I like that!)
You might also likeHe strolls in his stroller with the radio on
He doesn't go to sleep until the musics gone
He imitates the singer in the group
With a low down voice (dug-a-dug-a)

And when its time to tuck him in his little bed
With all that music runnin through his sleepy head
The little fella doesnt say goodnight
Instead, but he says (boog-ooo, boog-ooo, boog-ooo
Aaaaaaaaaaallllllllllll gone!)Embed
