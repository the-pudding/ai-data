Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

[Verse 1: Kevin DuBrow]
So, you think I got an evil mind? I tell you, honey
I don't know why, I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time? It makes me money
I don't know why, I don't know why
Anymore, oh, no

[Chorus: Kevin DuBrow, Carlos Cavazo & Rudy Sarzo]
So come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Baby!

[Verse 2: Kevin DuBrow]
So you say I got a funny face? I got no worries
And I don't know why, I don't know why
Oh, I gotta sing, it's some disgrace, I'm in no hurry
And I don't know why, I don't know why
Anymore, no, no, no

Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild, baby
Come on!

[Verse 3: Kevin DuBrow & Carlos Cavazo]
Well, you think we have a lazy time, you should know better
I don't know why, I don't know why
So you say I got a dirty mind? I'm a mean go-getter
I don't know why, I don't know why
Anymore, oh, no

[Chorus]
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Oh, wild
[Bridge]
Come on! (Come on!) Feel it!
Come on! (Girls, rock your boys) Work it!
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We're gonna get wild (Wild, wild, wild)
We're gonna get wild tonight (Come on, feel the noise)
Rock it tonight (Girls, rock your boys)
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Oh, yeah!

[Outro]
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah (Woo!)
Ah, ah, ah
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah
