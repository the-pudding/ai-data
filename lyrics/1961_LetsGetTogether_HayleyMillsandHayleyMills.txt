Let's get together, yay-yay-yay!
Why don't you and I combine?
Let's get together, what do you say
We can have a swinging time
We'd be a crazy team
Why don't we make a scene?
Together, oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

[Verse 2]
Let's get together, yay-yay-yay!
Think of all that we could share
Let's get together everyday
Every way and everywhere
And though we haven't got a lot
We could be sharing all we've got
Together

[Bridge]
Oh! I really think you're swell
Uh-huh, we really ring the bell
Oo-wee, and if you stick with me
Nothing could be greater, say "hey alligator"!

[Verse 3]
Let's get together, yay-yay-yay!
Two is twice as nice as one
Let's get together, right away
We'll be having twice the fun
And you can always count on me
A gruesome twosome we will be
Let's get together, yay-yay-yay!You might also likeEmbed
