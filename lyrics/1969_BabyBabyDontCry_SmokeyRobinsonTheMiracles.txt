5 ContributorsBaby, Baby Donâ€™t Cry Lyrics[Intro]
Nothing so blue as a heart in pain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain

Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Let him walk on out if he wants to
He really doesn't deserve you
His loss is our gain, so don't be blue
'Cause stone blind and out of his mind
Is what he has to be, yeah
Yeah, so, baby, straighten up, come on and fly right
It's no catastrophe, yeah

[Chorus]
I said, now, baby baby don't cry
Baby, baby, here's why
Love is here standin' by
Love is here standin' by

[Interlude]
You trusted him and gave him your love
A love he proved unworthy of

[Verse 2]
Too bad it was him that you trusted
Too bad, but you can't be disgusted
It's time that you got readjusted
And realised that tear-filled eyes
Can never stop him now, no, no, no
That man is on his way
I think he's gone to stay
You better drop him now, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Oowee now, baby, baby, don't cry, no, no
Baby, baby, here's why
Because love is here standin' by
I say love is right here standin' by

[Bridge]
All you've gotta do is dry your eyes long enough to see
That you have got the love you thought you had in him here in me
Love is hope, girl, love is strength
Here's someone standin' right beside ya who would go to any lengths
To give you love, true and deep
And help you realize at last you found a love that you can keep
And only losers weep

[Chorus]
So, ooh, baby (Baby, baby, don't cry)
Don't you cry now, oh, baby (Baby, baby, don't cry)
Let me tell you why, now (Baby baby here's why)
Don't you know that
Love is here standin' by
I say love is right here standin' by

Your tears are shed in vain, I said
So (Baby, baby, don't cry)
Come on, dry your eyes, baby (Baby, baby, don't cry)
Don't you realise, baby (Baby, baby, here's why)
You don't have to cry, because
Love is hereEmbed
