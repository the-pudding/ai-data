41 ContributorsIâ€™ll Be Lyrics[Intro: JAY-Z]
That's right, that's right
How we do
Yeah (Ill Na Na)
Uh-huh (Uh)
Come on

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown & JAY-Z]
What up, pop? Brace yourself as I ride on top
Close your eyes as you ride right out your socks
Double, lose his mind as he grind in the tunnel (Uh)
Wanna give me the cash he made off his last bundle (Uh-huh)
Nasty girl, don't pass me the world (Woah)
I push the V, not the backseat, girl
Don't deepthroat for C-notes, she floats (Woah)
Murder she wrote and keeps the heat close (Uh)
Firm, nigga, we 'posed to be the illest on three coasts
Familia bigger than Icos
Y'all Danny DeVitos, small niggas
All I see is the panty-eaters, that's all, niggas (C'mon)
Loan sharkin' this year, raise the figures (Uh)
Fifteen percent, make the whole world sit up
And take notice, Na Na take over (Na Na)
Y'all take quotas to hit, papa (I'll be good)

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Uh, straight out the gates, y'all, we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get?
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods, it's ripped
One thing's for sure (I'll be good)
That's right, we drop hits
Tell me, how nasty can you get?
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods, it's ripped
One thing's for sure (I'll be good)

I'm too live, nasty as I wanna be
Don't shake your sassy ass in front of me
'Fore I take it there and tear your back out
That shit ain't happened since The Mack was out, uh
Lola Falana, dripped in Gabbana
'90s style, the finest style
Random ways to fit, wanna taste the shit?
Put me on the basin, throw your face in it, fucker (Uh-huh)
Na Na, y'all can't touch her (Uh)
My sex drive all night like a trucker
Let alone the skills I possess (And?)
And y'all gon' see by these mils I possess (Right)
Never settle for less, I'm in excess
Not inexpensive, VVS
To the tilt, that's just the way I'm built
Nasty, what? Classy still (I'll be good)

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Uh, straight out the gates, y'all, we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get?
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods, it's ripped
One thing's for sure (I'll be good)
That's right, we drop hits
Tell me, how nasty can you get?
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods, it's ripped
One thing's for sure (I'll be good)
[Verse 3: JAY-Z & Foxy Brown]
Well, you can hold what I got, roll with the Roc
A-Fella capo in the candy apple drop (Stop)
Will tears fall to your ears if I don't stop?
Can you throw it like a quarterback, third and a lot? (Tell me)

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown & JAY-Z]
Dig me, I'll get you locked like Biggie with herb in the spot
Word middie, the cop and the biddie (Uh)
Uh, I'm the bomb-diggy, punana
Sexy brown thing, uh, Madon', y'all
Make him turn over from the full-court pressure
To undress you and shit all over your asses
I ain't playin', knock it out at the weigh-in
'Cause I'm sayin', what's the sense in delayin'? (Uh)
I'm tryna run G from the P to the AM
I saw your little thing, now I'm swayin', okay, then (Hah, yeah)

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Uh, uh, straight out the gates, y'all, we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get?
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods, it's ripped
One thing's for sure (I'll be good)
That's right, we drop hits
Tell me, how nasty can you get?
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods, it's ripped
One thing's for sure (I'll be good)3Embed
