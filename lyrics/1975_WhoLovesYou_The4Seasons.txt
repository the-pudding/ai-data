Who loves you, pretty baby?
Who's gonna help you through the night?
Who loves you, pretty mama?
Who's always there to make it right?

[Chorus]
Who loves you, pretty baby?
Who's gonna help you through the night?
Who loves you, pretty mama?
Who's always there to make it right?
(Who loves you?) Who loves you, pretty baby?
Who's gonna love you, mama?
(Who loves you?) Who loves you, pretty baby?

[Verse 1]
When tears are in your eyes
And you can't find the way
It's hard to make-believe
You're happy when you're gray
Baby, when you're feelin' like
You'll never see the mornin' light
Come to me, baby, you'll see

[Chorus]
Who loves you, pretty baby?
Who's gonna help you through the night?
Who loves you, pretty mama?
Who's always there to make it?
(Who loves you?) Who loves you, pretty baby?
Who's gonna love you, mama?
(Who loves you?) Who loves you, pretty baby?

And when you think
The whole wide world has passed you by
You keep on tryin'
But you really don't know why
Baby, when you need a smile
To help the shadows drift away
Come to me, baby, you'll see

[Chorus]
Who loves you, pretty baby?
Who's gonna help you through the night?
Who loves you, pretty mama?
Who's always there to make it?
(Who loves you?) Who's gonna love you, love you?
Who's gonna love you?
(Who loves you?) Who's gonna love you, love you?
Who's gonna love you?

[Chorus/Outro]
Who loves you, pretty baby?
Who's gonna help you through the night?
Who loves you, pretty mama?
Who's always there to make it?
(Who loves you?) Who's gonna love you, love you?
Who's gonna love you?
(Who loves you?) Who's gonna love you, love you?
Who's gonna love you?
