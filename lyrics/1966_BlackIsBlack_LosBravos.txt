[Verse 1]
Black is black
I want my baby back
It's grey, it's grey
Since she went away, oh, oh

[Refrain]
What can I do
'Cause I, I'm feelin' blue?

[Verse 2]
If I had my way
She'd be back today
But she don't intend
To see me again, oh, oh

[Refrain]
What can I do
'Cause I, I'm feelin' blue?

[Bridge]
I can't choose, it's too much to lose, my love's too strong, woah
Maybe if she would come back to me, then I can't go wrong

Bad is bad
Ah, that I feel so sad
It's time, it's time
Ah, that I found peace of mind, oh, oh

[Refrain]
What can I do
'Cause I, I'm feelin' blue?

[Bridge]
I can't choose, it's too much to lose, my love's too strong, woah
Maybe if she would come back to me, then I can't go wrong

[Verse 1]
Black is black
I want my baby back
It's grey, it's grey
Since she went away, oh, oh

[Refrain]
What can I do
'Cause I, I'm feelin' blue?

[Outro]
'Cause I, I'm feelin' blue?3Embed
