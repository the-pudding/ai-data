10 ContributorsGirl on TV Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, yeah yeah, I'm wishin' on a fallin' star
Wonderin' where you are, I wish

[Chorus]
Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels
Like Bette Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

[Verse 1]
Met her at a counter affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt out of place 'til she looked into my eyes

Shook her hand around 9 p.m. and I'm
Never gonna be the same again
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Shooby-doo-wop and Scooby Snacks
Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of soundin' cheesy
I think I fell for the girl on TV
You might also like[Chorus]
Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels
Like Bette Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows her name
They wanna take a picture and they're glad she came
But I just wanna be there when she's down, down
(Be there when she's down)

I don't want her autograph
I just wanna call her up and make her laugh
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Shooby doo-wop and Scooby Snacks
I met a fly girl and I can't relax
Only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of soundin' cheesy
I think, I fell for the girl on TV
[Chorus]
Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels
Like Bette Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

[Bridge]
(Wish for you on a falling star)
I'm wishing on a star and I'm wonderin' where you are
(Wondering where you are)
Do I cross your mind in the warm sunshine?

[Bridge]
Yeah, so I wish for you on a bright shining star
Everywhere I look, there you are, there you are
It's the girl in the green dress, she took my breath away
And now I look to the sky for a better day

To the beat, y'all, and Scooby Snacks
I met a fly girl and I can't relax
Never had to be on a movie screen
'Cause she's the leading lady in all my dreams, come on
[Chorus]
Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels
Like Bette Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

[Chorus]
Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels
Like Bette Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

[Outro]
On TV, I wishin', I wishin' away3Embed
