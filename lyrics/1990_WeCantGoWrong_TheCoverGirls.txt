3 ContributorsWe Canâ€™t Go Wrong Lyrics[Verse 1:]
For so long
I kept these feelings for you locked up inside
And there were nights that
I would cry myself to sleep and wonder why

Now I don't wanna tell you how to live
Don't wanna put the blame
But don't you think
It's time for you and I
To try to make a change

[Chorus:]
We can't go wrong
(Loving one another)
We can't go wrong
(Caring for each other)

We can't go wrong
If the love we have is real
We can't go wrong

[Verse 2:]
There was a time when things were better
Than the way they are today
But we forgot the vows we made
And love got lost along the way
You might also likeNow I can tell just by the way
You look at me that you feel the same
So don't you think it's time for
You and I to try to make a change

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

We can't go wrong
We can't go wrong
We can't go wrong
We can't go wrong

We can't go wrong
We can't go wrong
If the love we have is realEmbed
