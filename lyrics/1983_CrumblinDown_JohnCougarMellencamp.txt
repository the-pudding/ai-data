5 ContributorsCrumblin’ Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well some people ain't no damn good
You can't trust 'em you can't love 'em
No good deed goes unpunished
And I don't mind bein' their whippin' boy
I've had that pleasure for years and years
No no I never was a sinner—tell me what else can I do
Second best is what you get 'til you learn to bend the rules
And time respects no person—and what you lift up must fall
They're waiting outside to claim my tumblin' walls

[Pre-Chorus]
Saw my picture in the paper
Read the news around my face
And now some people don't want to treat me the same

[Chorus]
When the walls come tumblin' down
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down
Down, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Well some people say I'm obnoxious and lazy
I'm uneducated—my opinion means nothin'
But I know I'm a real good dancer
Don't need to look over my shoulder to see what I'm after
Everybody's got their problems—ain't no new news here
I'm the same old trouble you've been havin' for years
Don't confuse the problem with the issue girl
It's perfectly clear
Just a human desire to have you come near

Wanna put my arms around you
Feel your breath in my ear
You can bend me you can break me
But you'd better stand clear

[Chorus]
When the walls come tumblin' down
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin'
Crumblin' tumblin' down

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
When the walls come tumblin' down
When the walls come rumblin' rumblin'
When the walls (When the walls) come tumblin' tumblin' down

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah wanna put my arms around you
Feel your breath in my ear
You can bend me you can break me
But you'd better stand clear

[Chorus]
When the walls come tumblin' down
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin'
Crumblin' tumblin'
When the walls (When the walls) come tumblin' down
When the walls (When the walls) come crumblin' crumblin'
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin'
Crumblin' tumblin'
When the walls (When the walls) come tumblin' down
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin'
Crumblin' tumblin'
[Outro]
When the walls come tumblin' down
