It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

[Chorus]
And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

[Verse 2]
I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

[Chorus]
And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

[Bridge]
It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

[Chorus]
And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

And I've got a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
[Outro]
Gonna ride like the wind
Ride
Gonna ride like the wind
Gonna ride3Embed
