Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you (Ooh)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (You are always in my heart)
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh-oh)
[Outro]
('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
('Lone, 'lone) If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
('Lone, 'lone) Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh
('Lone, 'lone) Together, together
('Lone, 'lone) Not, not being alone
Not, not being alone
You believe in me34Embed
