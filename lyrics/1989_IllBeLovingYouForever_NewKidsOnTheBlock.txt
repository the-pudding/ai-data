Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm not that kind of guy who can take a broken heart
So don't ever leave, I don't want to see us part
The very thought of losing you means
That everything would go down under

[Chorus]
I'll be loving you forever
(Just as long as you want me to be)
I'll be loving you forever
(All this love's for you and me) Yeah
(I'll be loving you) I'll be
(I'll be loving you) Loving you
(The things you do) Yeah, it's forever
(I'll be loving you) I'll be
(I'll be loving you) Loving you
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I count the blessings that keep our love new
There's one for me and a million for you
There's just so much that I wanna say
But when I look at you, all my thoughts get in the way
