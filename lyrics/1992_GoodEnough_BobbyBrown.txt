6 ContributorsGood Enough Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
This is like the old times
I know a lot of you all out there can relate to the old times
So this one's for you
Yeah
Listen

[Verse 1]
If I take you back in the room, spent you around, my Baby
Take off your clothes and all of mine, too, laid you down
Way down

[Pre-Chorus]
We could be discrete nobody have to know, ha
We don't need no sheets, we can just close the door, my baby
I can take you places you ain't been before
Soon as we get there, baby
You'll be coming back for more

[Chorus]
'Cause If ain't good enough, good enough, baby
I'll work harder
I'll keep pumpin' every minute, girl
And baby I'll do you up, do you up, baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot

If I touch your body tonight, will you touch mine?
Will you touch me baby? Right here
Kiss both your lips and rubbin' those thighs
Taste your wine
Let me taste you baby, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can do it soft or I can do it hard
I can make you scream if you let down your guard, my baby
It's not too far from here to ecstasy
I know you want good lovin'
So lay your body next to me

[Chorus]
If ain't good enough, good enough, baby (If it ain't good)
I'll work harder
Pumpin' every minute, girl
And baby I'll do you up, do you up, baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot
If ain't good enough, good enough, baby (If it ain't good)
I'll work harder (I'll work hard)
Pumpin' every minute, girl (I'll work hard)
And baby I'll do you up, do you up, baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot (Know you're hot)
[Bridge]
Slow moving in your body
Feels like I'm gonna be in here all night
And when the love gets rolling
Start coming without stop
Filled to the brim
I'm gonna drip down to the very last drop

[Chorus]
And if ain't good enough for you, baby, ha
I'll do it all for you
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot
If ain't good enough, good enough, baby (If it ain't good)
I'll work harder (I'll work hard)
Pumpin' every minute, girl (I'll work hard)
And baby I'll do you up, do you up baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot (Know you're hot)

[Bridge]
If ain't good enough then I'll work harder
Turn it up, I'll please you, darlin'
Do it up, do it up just for you
And baby I'll taste the wine and give you pleasure
Close the door, I'll do whatever (Baby, I'll do whatever)
'Til I know you're hot
[Chorus]
If ain't good enough, good enough baby (If it ain't good)
I'll work harder (I'll work harder)
Pumpin' every minute, girl
And baby I'll do you up, do you up baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot
If ain't good enough, good enough, baby (Yeah)
I'll work harder (There's nothing I wouldn't do)
Pumpin' every minute, girl
And baby, I'll do you up, do you up baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot
If ain't good enough, good enough, baby1Embed
