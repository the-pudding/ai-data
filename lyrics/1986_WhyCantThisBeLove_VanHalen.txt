24 ContributorsWhy Canâ€™t This Be Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey, I don't know
Oh, tell me where to begin
'Cause I never ever
Felt so much
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't recall
Any love at all
Oh, baby, this blows 'em all away

[Chorus]
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

[Verse 2]
I tell myself
Hey, only fools rush in
Only time will tell if we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned if I'll get
Hung up on the line, hey
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't recall
Anything at all
Ah, baby, this blows 'em all away
Woo

[Chorus]
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
You want it straight from the heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Woo, it's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from the heart
Tell me why can't this be love?

[Outro]
Baby, why can't this be love?
Got to know why can't this be love?
I wanna know why can't this be love?3Embed
