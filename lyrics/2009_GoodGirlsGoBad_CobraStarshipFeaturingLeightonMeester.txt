I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Good girls go bad
Good girls go bad

[Verse 1: Gabe Saporta]
I know your type (Your type)
You're daddy's little girl
Just take a bite (One bite)
Let me shake up your world
'Cause just one night couldn't be so wrong
I'm gonna make you lose control

[Pre-Chorus: Gabe Saporta]
She was so shy
'Til I drove her wild

[Chorus: Gabe Saporta]
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go bad
You were hangin' in the corner with your five best friends
You heard that I was trouble, but you couldn't resist
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go

Good girls go bad, bad, bad
Good girls go bad (Bad, bad, bad)
Good girls go

She was so shy
'Til I drove her wild
