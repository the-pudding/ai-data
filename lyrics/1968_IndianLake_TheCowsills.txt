6 ContributorsIndian Lake Lyrics[Verse]
You take a bus marked "Lakewood Drive"
And you keep on ridin' 'til you're out of the city
Where the air is fine with the sweet smellin' pine
And the countryside's pretty
And you'll see daffodils peepin' over the hills
Or a honey-lovin' mama bear
Just take a left at the bridge
Go down to Quakertown Ridge
And in a minute, you're there

[Chorus]
(Let's go to)
Indian Lake is a scene you should make
With your little one
Keep it in mind if you're lookin' to find
A place in the summer sun
Swim in the cove, have a snack in the grove
Or you can rent a canoe
At Indian Lake, you'll be able to make
The way the Indians do

[Chorus]
(Let's go to)
Oh, Indian Lake is a scene you should make
With your little one
Just keep it in mind if you're lookin' to find
A place in the summer sun
You can swim in the cove, have a snack in the grove
Or you can rent a canoe
At Indian Lake, you'll be able to make
The way the Indians do
You might also like[Outro]
(Everybody go)
Hey, Indian Lake is a scene you should make
With your little one
Just keep it in mind if you're lookin' to find
A place in the summer sun
Swim in the cove, have a snack in the grove
Or you can rent a canoe...Embed
