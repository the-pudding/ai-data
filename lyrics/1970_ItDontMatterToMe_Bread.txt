6 ContributorsIt Donâ€™t Matter to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
It don't matter to me
If you really feel that
You need some time to be free
Time to go out searching for yourself
Hoping to find time to go to find

And it don't matter to me
If you take up with someone
Who's better than me
Cause your happiness is all I want
For you to find (peace)
Your peace of mind

[Chorus]
Lotta people have an ego hang-up
Cause they want to be the only one
How many came before
It really doesn't matter
Just as long as you're the last
Everybody's moving on
And trying to find out
What's been missing in the past

[Verse 2]
And it don't matter to me
If your searching brings you
Back together with me
Cause there'll always be
An empty room waiting for you
An open heart waiting for you
Time is on my side
You might also like[Refrain]
Cause it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me

[Outro]
Cause there'll always be
An empty room waiting for you
An open heart waiting for you
Time is on my side
Cause it don't matter to me1Embed
