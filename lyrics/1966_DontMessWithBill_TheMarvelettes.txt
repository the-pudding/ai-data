Don't mess with Bill
(No, no, no, no)
Don't mess with Bill
(Don't mess with Bill)
Say it one more time
(Don't mess with Bill)

[Verse 1]
Well, I know he's the guy who put tears in my eyes
A thousand times or more
Oh, but every time he would apologise
I loved him more than before

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear what I say, girls keep away
(Ah, ha, ha)

[Chorus]
Don't mess with Bill
(No, no, no, no)
(Don't mess with Bill)
Leave my Billy alone
(Don't mess with Bill)
Get a guy of your own
(Don't mess with Bill)

Now there's Johnny, there's Joe
And there's Frank and Jim
Just to name a few
Now, Bill's got me and I've got him
I'm sure there's one for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear what I say, girls keep away
(Ah, ha, ha)

[Chorus]
Don't mess with Bill
(No, no, no, no)
(Don't mess with Bill)
He's mine, all mine
(Don't mess with Bill)
I say it one more time
(Don't mess with Bill)

[Verse 3]
Though I tell myself he wants no one else
'Cause he keeps coming back to me
Now I'm in no position to want competition
I want to be sure as can be
[Pre-Chorus]
Hear what I say, girls keep away
(Ah, ha, ha)

[Chorus]
Don't mess with Bill
(No, no, no, no)
(Don't mess with Bill)
Leave my Billy alone
(Don't mess with Bill)
Get a guy of your own
(Don't mess with Bill)
'Cause he's mine, all mine
(Don't mess with Bill)
I say it one more time
(Don't mess with Bill)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Don't mess with Bill)
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Don't mess with Bill)Embed
