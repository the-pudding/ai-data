86 ContributorsJealous Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't like the way he's lookin' at you
I'm startin' to think you want him, too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can I help it?
(Jealous, jealous, jealous, jealous)

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffin' my chest
I'm gettin' red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous

I wish you didn't have to post it all
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me
Protective or possessive? Girl
Call it passive or aggressive

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffin' my chest
I'm gettin' red in the face
You can call me obsessed
Itâ€™s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous (Jealous, jealous)
[Bridge]
We're the only ones invited (Invited)
Say there's no one else for you (For you)
'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
When you get jealous, too

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffin' my chest
I'm turnin' red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful (Oh, baby)
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why, that's why)
I still get jealous (I get jealous)
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful (You get jealous)
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why, that's why)
I still get jealous (Jealous)
[Outro]
Oh (Oh), that's why
I still get jealous (Jealous, jealous)
Oh (Oh), that's why
I still get jealous (Jealous, jealous, jealous)153Embed
