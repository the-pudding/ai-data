6 ContributorsLately Lyrics[Chorus]
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by

[Verse 1]
Have you ever felt a breeze hit your heart
Like the wind was blowin' it apart (blowin' it apart)
As you're spinnin' like a merry-go-round
Indications of a storm touchin' down
I wish that I could weather any storm
But I guess it was a heartbreak from the norm
Was a day I will always remember
The saddest day in sweet November

[Chorus]
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by (Watchin' the days go by)

Baby, I'm on my knees
Prayin', "God help me, please
Bring my baby back
Right back to me" (Mmm)
If lovin' you is right
Then I don't wanna go wrong
So I drown myself with tears
Sitting here, singin' another sad love song

[Chorus]
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by

[Bridge]
Lately, I've been torn apart
I wish you hadn't broke my heart
I'm missin' you, babe, missin' you every day
Lately, I've been torn apart
I wish you hadn't broke my heart
I'm missin' you babe, missin' you every day
[Chorus]
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by

[Chorus]
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go byEmbed
