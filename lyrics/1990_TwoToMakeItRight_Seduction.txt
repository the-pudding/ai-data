7 ContributorsTwo To Make It Right Lyrics[Intro]
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you

[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

[Verse 1]
From the start it's plain to see
You're suffering from a serious broken heart
You know that it's a shame
But I'm here to ease your pain
There's no need for you to feel so all alone
And you and I could seriously be
A sure enough happening thing
Don't you know that---

[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
You might also like[Verse 2]
I can see it in your eyes
You feel the same way, I feel about you
Some call it chemistry
I call it, you should be with me
'Cause I know together we can really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you
Don't you know that---

[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

[Verse 3]
I don't believe in fairy tales
But I believe some things were meant to be
Why should we be alone?
When we could have each others arms to hold
'Cause I know together we could really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you
And don't you know that---
[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

[Outro]
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and youEmbed
