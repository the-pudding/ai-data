You ask me if I love you, and I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly, than mislead you with a lie

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And who am I to judge you, on what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning, to see the real you

[Chorus]
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes, and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you, 'til the fear in me subsides

[Verse 2]
Romance and all its strategy, leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity, some tenderness survives

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter, still trapped within my youth

[Chorus]
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you, 'til the fear in me subsides
You might also like[Bridge]
At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

[Verse 3]
At times I understand you, and I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you, and I've watched love pass you by

[Pre-Chorus 3]
At times I think we're drifters, still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister, but then the passion flares again

[Chorus]
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you, 'til the fear in me subsides1Embed
