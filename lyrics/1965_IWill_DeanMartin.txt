4 ContributorsI Will Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the one to say I'm gonna miss you
But I will (I will)
I don't want to say I'm gonna cry my eyes out, baby
But I will (I will)
I'm not ashamed for you to know
How much I really love you so
'Cause it was such a thrill
And just remember when you're gone
There'll be that someone sad who loves you still

[Verse 2]
You will look at him and see me smiling back at you
I know you will (You will)
And you will find yourself repeating things we used to do
I know you will (You will)
Don't wonder if you wanna come back
Just come running home to me
And let me feel that thrill
'Cause I'm the one who told you
I would love you dear forever and I will

[Bridge]
Oh, I will
Yes, I will
You might also like[Outro]
Don't wonder if you want to come back
Just come running home to me
And let me feel that thrill
'Cause I'm the one who told you
I would love you, dear, forever and I will
'Cause I'm the one who told you
I would love you, dear, forever and I will
(I will)Embed
