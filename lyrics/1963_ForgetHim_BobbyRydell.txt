3 ContributorsForget Him Lyrics[Intro]
(Forget him)
(Forget him)

[Verse 1]
Forget him if he doesn't love you
Forget him if he doesn't care
Don't let him tell you that he wants you
'Cause he can't give you love which isn't there

[Verse 2]
Oh, little girl, he's never dreamin' of you
He'll break your heart, you wait and see
So, don't you cry now, just tell him goodbye now
Forget him and please come home to me

[Verse 1]
(Forget him if he doesn't love you
Forget him if he doesn't care)
Don't let him tell you that he wants you
'Cause he can't give you love which isn't there

[Verse 2]
Oh, little girl, he's never dreamin' of you
He'll break your heart, you wait and see
So, don't you cry now, just tell him goodbye now
Forget him and please come home to me

No, don't you cry now, better tell him, goodbye now
Forget him, and please come home to meEmbed
