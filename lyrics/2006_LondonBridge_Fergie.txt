Oh, shit (Oh, shit)
Oh, shit (Oh, shit)
Oh, shit (Oh, shit)
(They ain't ready for this)
Oh, shit (Oh)
It's me, Fergie, ha
The Pen
Polow
(Fergie, Ferg, what's up, baby? Come on, come on)

[Refrain: Fergie & Polow da Don]
When I come to the club, step aside (Oh, shit)
Part the seas, don't be havin' me in the line (Oh, shit)
VIP, 'cause you know I gotta shine (Oh, shit)
I'm Fergie Ferg, and me love you long time (Oh, shit)
All my girls get down on the floor (Oh, shit)
Back to back, drop it down real low (Oh, shit)
I'm such a lady, but I'm dancin' like a ho (Oh, shit)
'Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go (Oh, shit)

[Chorus: Fergie]
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down?
Like London London London wanna go down
Like London London London be goin' down like
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down?
Like London London London wanna go down
Like London London London be goin' down like

Now as the drinks start pouring and my speech start slurring
Everybody start looking real good (Oh, shit)

[Verse: Fergie & Polow da Don]
That Grey Goose got your girl feeling loose
Now I'm wishing that I didn't wear these shoes (I hate heels)
It's like every time I get up on the dude (Oh)
Paparazzi put my business in the news
And I'm like, get up out my face (Oh, shit)
Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace (Oh, shit)
My lips make you wanna have a taste (Oh, shit)
You got that? I got the bass

[Chorus: Fergie]
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down?
Like London London London wanna go down
Like London London London be goin' down like
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down?
Like London London London wanna go down
Like London London London be goin' down like

Me like a bullet type, you know they comin', right? (Oh, shit)
Fergie love' 'em long time, my girls support 'em, right? (Oh, shit)
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do
Me like a bullet type, you know they comin', right? (Oh, shit)
