Dance with me
I want to be your partner
Can't you see?
The music is just starting
Night is calling and I am falling
Dance with me

[Verse 2]
Fantasy
Could never be so killing
I feel free
I hope that you are willing
Pick the beat up and kick your feet up
Dance with me

[Chorus]
Let it lift you off the ground
Starry eyes and love is all around us
I can take you where you want to go
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Dance with me
I want to be your partner
Can't you see?
The music is just starting
Night is calling and I am falling
Dance with me

I can take you where you want to go
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Dance with me
I want to be your partner
Can't you see?
The music is just starting
Night is calling and I am falling
Dance with me1Embed
