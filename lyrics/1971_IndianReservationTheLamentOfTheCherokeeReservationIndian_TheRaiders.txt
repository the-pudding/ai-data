17 ContributorsIndian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian) Lyrics[Verse 1]
They took the whole Cherokee nation
Put us on this reservation
Took away our ways of life
The tomahawk and the bow and knife
Took away our native tongue
And taught their English to our young
And all the beads we made by hand
Are nowadays made in Japan

[Chorus]
Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe
So proud to live, so proud to die

[Verse 2]
They took the whole Indian nation
Locked us on this reservation
Though I wear a shirt and tie
I'm still a red man deep inside

[Chorus]
Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe
So proud to live, so proud to die

[Outro]
But maybe someday when they've learned
Cherokee nation will return, will return, will return, will return, will returnYou might also like1Embed
