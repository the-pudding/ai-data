Darling, I love you, though you treat me cruel
You hurt me and you make me cry
But if you leave me, I will surely die

Darling, there will never be another
Cause I love you so
Don't ever leave me, say you'll never go

I will always want you for my sweetheart
No matter what you do
Oh! Carol, I'm so in love with you
Oh! Carol, I am but a fool
Darling, I love you, though you treat me cruel
You hurt me and you make me cry
But if you leave me, I will surely die
Darling, there will never be another
Cause I love you so
Don't ever leave me, say you'll never go

I will always want you for my sweetheart
No matter what you do
Oh! Carol, I'm so in love with youYou might also like2Embed
