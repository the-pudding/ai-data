9 ContributorsCrush On You Lyrics[Chorus]
How did you know, 'cause I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

[Verse 1]
You must have heard it from my best friend
She's always talking when she should be listening
Can't keep a secret to save her life
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew a rumor could spread so fast
'Cause now the word is out all over town
That I'm longing for you

[Chorus]
How did you know, 'cause I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was the one who left the trace
Was there a message written on my face?
Were my emotions so easily read
That you would know my love before a word was said
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Was it my eyes that let you know you had control?
Because the way you move was so self-assured
You knew I would surrender

[Chorus]
How did you know, 'cause I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
How did you know, 'cause I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

[Outro]
You found out I've got a crush on you
You found out I've got a crush on you
Crush on you
