15 ContributorsWindy Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Who's peekin' out from under a stairway
Callin' a name that's lighter than air?
Who's bendin' down to give me a rainbow?
Everyone knows it's Windy

[Chorus]
Who's trippin' down the streets of the city
Smilin' at everybody she sees?
Who's reachin' out to capture a moment?
Everyone knows it's Windy

[Bridge]
And Windy has stormy eyes
That flash at the sound of lies
And Windy has wings to fly
Above the clouds (Above the clouds)
Above the clouds (Above the clouds)

[Flute Solo]

[Bridge]
And Windy has stormy eyes
That flash at the sound of lies
And Windy has wings to fly
Above the clouds (Above the clouds)
Above the clouds (Above the clouds)
