You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)
Bein' the way that you are is enough

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus: All, Harry]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

[Verse 2: Zayn]
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus: All, Harry]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else ('Body else)
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

[Bridge: All]
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na-na-na, na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na-na-na, na-na

[Breakdown: Harry, All]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
(You don't know, oh-oh) You don't know you're beautiful
[Chorus: All, Harry, Zayn]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else (Light up my world like nobody else)
The way that you flip your hair (C'mon) gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground (Smile at the ground), it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh, woah)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately (Desperately)
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know (Don't know), oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
