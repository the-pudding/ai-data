10 ContributorsItâ€™s Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
When we met, it wasn't quite clear to me
What you had in store was there for only me
Silly, you know you took me by surprise
Then I turned and looked, I saw that message in your eye

[Pre-Chorus]
There you were, I fell on the floor
The way you move, girl, only made me want you more
I did not know you had me hypnotized
There's a movement of your body dancin' in my eyes
I know I had to hold you and make you mine
Don't want to control you, just to have a good time

[Chorus]
In ecstasy when you're layin' down next to me
Oh, no, no, ecstasy, yeah, when you're layin' down next to me

[Verse 2]
I find it hard for me to concentrate
If I don't make my move, girl, it might be too late
I've got to make sure you don't get away
After all you've done, girl, to make me wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life I've been searchin' for a star
Now my search is over and here we are
You might also like[Chorus]
Livin' in ecstasy, yeah, when you lay down next to me, yeah
Here in ecstasy, when you're layin' down next to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hold you and make you mine
Don't want to control you, just to have a good time

[Chorus]
Livin' in ecstasy, well, when you're layin' down next to me
Ooh, ooh, ooh wee, ecstasy

[Break]

[Outro]
Ecstasy, when you lie here with me
Well, girl, it's ecstasy, when you're layin' here with me, uh-huh
Girl, it's ecstasy when you are here with me, yeah
Oh, it's ecstasy, Lord knows when you're next to me, yeahEmbed
