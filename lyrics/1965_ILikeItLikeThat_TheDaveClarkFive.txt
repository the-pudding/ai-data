2 ContributorsI Like It Like That Lyrics[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Whoa, come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
I said the name of the place is I Like It Like That

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Whoa, I wanna show you (Come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is I Like It Like That

[Verse 1]
They got a little place down the track
The name of the place is I Like It Like That
You take Sally, and I'll take Sue
And we're gonna rock away all of our blues

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Whoa, come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is I Like It Like That

[Verse 2]
The last time I was down there they lost my shoes
They had some cat shoutin' the blues
The people was yellin' and shoutin' for more
And all they kept sayin' was-a "Go, man, go"
You might also like[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
I wanna show you (Come on let me show you where it's at)
I said the name of the place is I Like It Like That

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Ah, come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
Oh, come on (Come on let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is I Like It Like ThatEmbed
