Nowhere to run to, baby (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Nowhere to hide

[Verse 1]
It's not love I'm running from
It's the heartbreak I know will come
'Cause I know you're no good for me (You're no good for me)
But youâ€™ve become a part of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Everywhere I go, your face I see
Every step I take, you take with me, yeah

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run to, baby (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Nowhere to hide
I know you're no good for me
But free of you, I'll never be, no

[Verse 2]
Each night as I sleep
Into my heart, you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you
Hoping soon that I'll forget you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When I look in the mirror to comb my hair
I see your face just smiling there

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Nowhere to hide from you, babe
Got nowhere to run to, baby (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Nowhere to hide
I know you're no good for me
But you've become a part of me

[Verse 3]
How can I fight a love
That shouldn't be?
When it's so deep, so deep
Deep inside of me

[Pre-Chorus]
My love reaches so high, I can't get over it
It's so wide, I can't get around it, no

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Nowhere to hide from you, baby
Just can't get away from you, baby (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
No matter how I try
I know you're no good for me
But free of you, I'll never be
[Chorus]
Nowhere to run to, baby (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Nowhere to hide (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Got nowhere to run to, baby (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Nowhere to hide (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)

Got nowhere to run (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)
Got nowhere to hide (Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide)2Embed
