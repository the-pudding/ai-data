4 ContributorsWhatâ€™s Your Name Lyrics[Verse 1]
What's your name?
I have seen you before
What's your name?
May I walk you to your door?

[Chorus]
It's so hard to find a personality
With charms like yours for me
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-wee

[Verse 2]
What's your name?
Is it Mary or Sue?
What's your name?
Do I stand a chance with you?

[Chorus]
It's so hard to find a personality
With charms like yours for me
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee, ooh-wee

[Bridge]
I stood on this corner waiting for you to come along
So my heart could feel satisfied
So please let me be your Number One
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun

Oh-oh, what's your name? (What's your name?)
Is it Mary or Sue?
What's your name?
Do I stand a chance with you?

[Chorus]
It's so hard to find a personality
With charms like yours for me
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee, ooh-wee

[Outro]
What's your name?
What's your name?
