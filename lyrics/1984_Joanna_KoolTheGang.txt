Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me

[Verse 1]
I'm in love, and I won't lie
She's my girl and always on my mind
She gives me her love, and a feeling that's right
Never lets me down, especially at night
So, I'm gonna do the best I can
To please that girl and be her only man
See, she picks me up when I'm feelin' low
And that's why baby, I've got to let you know

[Chorus]
Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me, my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
She's the one, the one for me
She's the kind of girl makes you feel nice
So, I'll try my best to do what's right
Take her for a ride, everything's fine

[Chorus]
Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me

Searched so far, searched so long
To find someone, someone to count on
Now I feel I've got it right here
Found it in you, baby, you, my dear
We can do all night, so nice
We'll have it all, and everything will be alright
I'm promising you, take it from me
Take it home, baby, take it home, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
She's the one, the one for me
She's the kind of girl makes you feel nice, so
I'll try my best to do what's right
Take her for a ride, everything's fine

[Bridge]
Ooh, Joanna
Ooh, Joanna

[Chorus]
Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me (Ooh, yeah)

[Outro]
Joanna, I love you (Yes, I love you)
You're the one, the one for me
Believe me, babe (When I say)3Embed
