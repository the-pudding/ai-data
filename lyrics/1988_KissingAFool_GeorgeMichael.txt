33 ContributorsKissing a Fool Lyrics[Verse 1]
You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough to even make a start
But you'll never find peace of mind 'til you listen to your heart

[Chorus]
People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them steal your heart from you
People
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

[Bridge]
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So goodbye
But please don't take my heart

[Verse 2]
You are far
I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough
I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind, while I listen to my heart
You might also like[Chorus]
People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them steal your heart
And people
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
Ba-da-da-ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
But remember this, every other kiss
That you ever give long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you like I always do
There's somethin' there that can't compare with any other

[Verse 1]
You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough to think you'd love me too
Guess you were kissing a fool
[Outro]
You must have been kissing a fool7Embed
