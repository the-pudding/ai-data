7 ContributorsWhat Does It Take (To Win Your Love) Lyrics[Chorus]
What does it take (What does it take)
To win your love for me? (To win your love for me)
How can I make (How can I make)
This dream come true for me? (Come true for me)

[Verse 1]
Woah, I just got to know (Have to know)
Ooh, baby, 'cause I love you so
Gonna blow for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
In every way I could (Any way I could)
To make you see how much I love you (See how much I love you)
Woo, I thought you understood (Thought you understood)

[Verse 2]
So, you gotta make me see (Make me see)
What does it take to win your love for me?
Gonna blow again for you

[Outro]
