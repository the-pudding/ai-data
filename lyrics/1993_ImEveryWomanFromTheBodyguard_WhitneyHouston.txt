5 ContributorsIâ€™m Every Woman (Live from The Bodyguard Tour) Lyrics[Intro]
Whatever you want
Whatever you need, oh, whatever you need
Anything you want done baby
I'll do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman (Every woman)
It's all in me
It's all in me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh...
(Whatever you want, whatever you need)
(Whatever you want, whatever you need)
Oh yeah, come on

[Chorus]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I do it naturally
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa (Oh) whoa whoa
You might also like[Verse 1]
I can cast a spell
See, but you can't tell
Mix a special groove
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly, I will appear
Yeah, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I do it naturally
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 2]
Oh, I can sense your needs
Like rain onto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old-fashioned love
I've got it, I've got it
I've got it, got it, baby, baby

[Chorus]
I'm every woman
It's all in me (It's all in me)
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally (I'll do it, I'll do it)
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa (Oh) whoa (Oh) whoa (Oh)
[Bridge]
I ain't bragging
Because I'm the one
Just ask me
Oh, and it shall be done
And don't bother
To compare
I've got it
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa (I got it, got it, got it, yeah)
Oh, whoa whoa whoa
Oh, oh

[Outro]
I'm every woman (I'm every woman)
I'm every woman (Do you believe in that?)
I'm every woman (Oh, I want you to know that, baby)
I'm every woman (Oh)
I'm every woman (Chaka Khan)
I'm every woman (Chaka Khan)
I'm every woman (Ooh)
I'm every woman (I'm every, oh)
I'm every woman (Peace, God bless you, good night)
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every womanEmbed
