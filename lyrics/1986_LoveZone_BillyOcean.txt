I need you here in my arms
You won't have to worry
I'll spend each day in your charms
I want to kiss you all over
Running my hands through your hair
I know a place where love is
I'll keep you warm night and day

In the love zone
You don't have to be alone
Together we can live and learn
In the love zone

Come rest you head on my shoulder
And we'll count the stars in the night
I want to feel you beside me
Just holding you tight
I want to give you a little tenderness
Letting you know how much you're loved
I want to hold you close to me
To keep you warm night and day

In the love zone
You don't have to be alone
Together we can live and learn
In the love zone
You might also likeOh baby, don't you know
I'll do the best I can
To be good for you
But when love's a guarantee
There is no mystery
And you'll never be a stranger
Out there on your own
In the love zone

Your love made the difference
In my life
(Never be a stranger)
You'll never be alone

In the love zone
You don't have to be alone
Together we can live and learn
In the love zoneEmbed
