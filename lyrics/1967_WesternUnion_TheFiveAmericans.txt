*telegraph*

[Verse 1]
Things went wrong today
Bad news came my way
I woke up to find
Oh, I had blew my mind

[Verse 2]
Western Union man
Bad news in his hand
Knocking at my door
Selling me the score

[Verse 3]
Fifteen cents a word to read
A telegram I didn't need
Says she doesn't care no more
Think I'll throw it on the floor

[Bridge]
Got your cable just today
Killed my groove I've got to say-ay-ay

[Chorus]
Western Union
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)

Now, you've gone away, and
How it's sad to say you've gone
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)
I remember what they said
Now, I'm going out of my head
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)

[Bridge]
Telegram just had to say
You've learned your lesson all the way-ay

[Organ Solo]

[Bridge]
Telegram just had to say
You've learned your lesson all the way-ay-ay

[Chorus]
Western Union
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)
[Verse 4]
I'll be on my way 'cause
There's another girl for me
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)
I'll be sure of her, and
Things will be as they were
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)

[Outro]
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)
Western Union
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)
Oh, Western Union
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)
Western Union
(Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta)Embed
