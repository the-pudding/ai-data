25 ContributorsGone Till November Lyrics[Intro]
I dedicate this record, The Carnival, to all you brothers takin' long trips down south
Virginia, Baltimore, all around the world
And your girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back
She's sittin' back in her room, the lights is off, she's cryin'
And then my voice comes in, pow
In the middle of the night and this is what I told her for you

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself, "Why, oh, why?" (One-two, one-two)
See, you must understand, I can't work a nine to five
So I'll be gone 'til November (One-two, one-two)
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November (Ready?)
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November (One-two, one-two)
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother (Y'all ready?)

[Verse 1]
When I come back, there'll be no need to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother go to school in September
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, Jerry, wear his condom
If you don't wear condom, you'll see a red lump
Woah, oh-oh-oh
You sucker MC's, you got no flow
I heard your style, you're s-o s-o
You might also like[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself, "Why, oh, why?"
See, you must understand, I can't work a nine to five
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

[Verse 2]
I had to flip nothin' and turn it into somethin'
Hip-hop turns to the future rock when I smash a pumpkin
Commit treason, then I'll have a reason
To hunt you down, it's only right, it's rappin' season
Yeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice
Your voice, I'll make a hearse out of your Rolls-Royce
Besides, I got my girl to remember
And I committed that I'll be back in November

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself, "Why, oh, why?"
See, you must understand, I can't work a nine to five
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother
